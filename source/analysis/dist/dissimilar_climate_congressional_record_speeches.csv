Mr. HYDE,2002-02-13,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume just to say to my friend from the upper regions of Massachusetts that Nadine Strossen. the president of the ACLU. has written me several warm letters. and we have worked together on civil asset forfeiture. a concept that the gentleman has supported. So we found common ground on more than one issue with the ACLU. Lastly. I would hope the gentleman would read section 602. The inaccuracies and errors in the petition itself are the result of midnight draftsmanship which is brought upon us as a gift from the gentleman from Maryland and his party whose devotion to rapidity sometimes intrudes on coherence.,R,Mrs. LINCOLN,2002-02-13,for her help in this effort. If we are successful in passing this tax credit. an effective education program to educate the public on the benefits of biodiesel fuel will be essential as biodiesel makes the transition from research and development to commerciklization. During the markup of the energy title of the farm bill. the Senate Agriculture Committee passed my amendment to authorize $25 million over the next five years for the Biodiesel Fuel Education Program. My amendment. which passed the committee unanimously. increased the amount available from $1 million to $5 million annually through 2006 for grants to educate Americans about biodiesel. The passage of this amendment was a critical step toward encouraging the production and use of biodiesel. I am pleased to report that the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Agriculture Committee have now accepted my floor amendment that will provide mandatory funding for the Biodiesel Fuel Education Program. My amendment will avoid the need to go through the annual appropriations process by providing $5 million in mandatory funding annually in fiscal years 2003 through 2006. The. biodiesel tax credit. together with the Biodiesel Fuel Education Program. provides a comprehensive approach to facilitate the entry of biodiesel fuels into the marketplace. Working in tandem. these legislative initiatives will educate the public. increase demand for biodiesel. bring higher prices for farmers. lower government outlays. improve the environment. and lower our dependence on foreign oil.,D,0.23145893
Mr. HYDE,2002-02-13,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume just to say to my friend from the upper regions of Massachusetts that Nadine Strossen. the president of the ACLU. has written me several warm letters. and we have worked together on civil asset forfeiture. a concept that the gentleman has supported. So we found common ground on more than one issue with the ACLU. Lastly. I would hope the gentleman would read section 602. The inaccuracies and errors in the petition itself are the result of midnight draftsmanship which is brought upon us as a gift from the gentleman from Maryland and his party whose devotion to rapidity sometimes intrudes on coherence.,R,Mrs. LINCOLN,2002-02-14,"Mr. President. yesterday I introduced S. 1942. the ""Biodiesel Promotion Act of 2002."" to provide tax incentives for the production of biodiesel from agricultural oils. I was pleased to be joined bySenators DAYTON and JOHNSON as original cosponsors of my bill. I was also pleased yesterday to be joined by Senator GRASSLEY in offering S. 1942 in amendment form to the Senate Finance Committee Energy Tax In-. centives legislation. My - amendment was included in the legislation with an overwhelmingly favorable vote of 16 to 5. The amendment differs from S. 1942 only in the length of authorization of the program. Due to budget constraints. the amendment authorizes the program for three years as opposed to the bill language of a tenyear authorization. S. 1942 is a start. but we must make sure that these incentives are not just a flash in the pan. We must ensure that biodiesel becomes a central component of this nations automobile fuel market. S. 1942 will provide a partial exemption from the diesel excise tax for diesel blended with biodiesel. Specifically. the bill provides a 1cent reduction for every percent of biodiesel blended with diesel up to 20 percent. The bill also provides for reimbursing of the Highway Trust Fund from the USDA Commodity Credit Corporation. (CCC). I believe this procedure will protect the Trust Fund from lost revenues due to the biodiesel incentive while providing a muchneeded boost to our nations biodiesel industry. The cost to the CCC would be offset at least initially by the savings under the marketing loan program. Biodiesel. which can be made from just about any agricultural oil including oils from soybeans. cottonseed. or rice. is completely renewable. contains no petroleum. and can be easily blended with petroleum diesel. A biodieseldiesel blend typically contains up to 20 percent renewable content. It can be added directly into the gas tank of a compressionignition. diesel engine vehicle with no major modifications. Biodiesel in its neat or pure form is completely biodegradable and nontoxic. contains no sulfur. and it is the first and only alternative fuel to meet EPAs Tier I and II health effects testing standards. Biodiesel also has many environmental and operational benefits. One I would like to highlight is the fuels lubricating characteristics. Even at very low blends. biodiesel contributes operational and maintenance benefits to diesel engines by continuously cleansing the engine as it runs. This is even more significant when using ultralow sulfur diesel. With the EPAs new rule to reduce the sulfur content of highway diesel fuel by over 95 percent. biodiesel stands ready to help us reach this requirement. Farmers in my State of Arkansas and across the country began investing in the development of biodiesel because of the economics of the farm industry. Producing biodiesel from farm commodity oils will provide a ready new market for our farm products. Currently. agricultural oils are widely produced for use in. our food markets. However. large supplies of vegetable oils in the world market have resulted in depressed commodity prices in the domestic market. More than a decade ago. soybean growers recognized that the traditional approach of riding out a depressed market by storing surplus soybean oil until better times would no longer work. The industry had to do more. It needed a proactive and aggressive plan to develop new markets and expand existing ones. Biodiesel is one of these new markets identified with true potential for displacing large quantities of soybean oil. For cotton. the cottonseed is presently about 20 percent of the value of the crop. Biodiesel will open new valueadded uses for the cottonseed oil at a time when new uses and markets are extremely important because of these hard economic times. And for our rice farmers. biodiesel will provide additional incremental increases in value to our rice crop and open up a new outlet for the coproduct of rice bran oil. A Department of Energy and Department of Agriculture study has shown that biodiesel yields 3.2 units of fuel product energy for every unit of fossil energy consumed in its life cycle. By contrast. petroleum diesels life cycle yields only 0.83 units of fuel product energy per unit of fossil energy consumed. Such measures confirm the ""renewable"" nature of biodiesel. Even after years of research and market development. biodiesel is not yet costcompetitive with petroleum diesel. In order to be so. market support and tax incentives are needed. I believe the provisions provided in this bill will help in leveling the field for biodiesel blends and help jumpstart this exciting new industry. The time is right for this investment. It is right for our rural economy. for our environment. and for our national energy security.",D,0.253272
Mr. WESTMORELAND,2008-04-10,Madam Chairman. you know. its interesting that we came here to talk about a beach bill. and were finally getting a chance to talk about some energy because most American families are not going to have the money to drive to the beach this year. We look at the price of gasoline right now. And I earlier quoted some of the quotes from the Democratic leadership about bLow they were going to get a grip and get ahold of the gas prices and bring them down. Well. since theyve been in the majority. they have actually gone up $1 per gallon. oil has gone up about 100 percent. And what are we telling our people at home? Ive got to go back and explain to the people of the Third District of Georgia that this week. rather than addressing the price of gas and our energy situation. that we did some beach restoration. which is a very worthy bill. we did some land*scape conservation. we named some post .offices. and we did some several other suspensions. But Ive got to go back and tell them that. when theyre standing there at the gas pump almost pumping $4 a gallon into their car. that they need to realize something. they need to realize what the majority plan for our future price of motor fuel is. The chairman. who I have a great deal of respect for. on the Transportation Committee. Mr. OBERSTAR. whos been here a long time and is very wise. but he projected or at least proposed a 5 cents a gallon hike for our infrastructure and $1 per barrel on oil. The Energy and Commerce chairman is talking about a carbon tax. Hes also talking about a 50 cent per gallon tax on fuel. Were talking about taking away these tax breaks from Big Oil. You know. we can take away tax breaks from anybody. but Im telling you. if you take a tax break away from a company that is manufacturing products in this country. theyre not going to just absorb that loss. theyre going to go up on the price of their product. So were talking about maybe 55. 60 cents more. a gallon. So Ive got to go back and tell my constituents. look. heres their plan: Their plan is to go up another 55 cents or so a gallon on your gas. another dollar on a barrel of oil. take away any tax breaks that the big oil companies have that hopefully theyre passing on to you. and your Congress just spent $30.000 to buy 30 bicycles. So theyve got a great plan. And I guess this is the great plan that weve heard about in so many of these quotes about how they were going to fix the price of gas. Weve bought 30 bicycles at a cost of $30.000. were going to increase the price of gas 55 cents. were going to take away the tax breaks for Big Oil so they can go up. increase the price on a barrel of oil. Were not going to do any domestic drilling. Were going to depend on changing light bulbs. Were going to depend on solar power. Were going to depend on windmills. Now. Madam Chairman. I just dont know how much comfort thats going to give the people of the Third Congressional District of Georgia. In fact. I dont know that if I tell them that. that theyre even going to believe that. that this body. this House. that is their answer to them paying $4 a gallon for gas. Its just going to be hard for me to sell it. But if they will pay attention to -whats going on up here. then I think theyll be convinced that these are the only things that the majority has brought forth. We need to concentrate on being less dependent on foreign oil. We need to look at our own future. our own lands. our own prospects of what were doing. And as the gentleman from Alaska said. regardless of what you think about fossil fuels. were going to be using it. And so we need to provide for ourselves. And I think its a shame that each and every one of us. and I know were going to be through by 4 oclock because. you know. we do need to get home. but were not doing our job. Were not doing the business of the people when we constantly go home and people ask us. help us. help me. help me be able to put gas in my car to take my children to soccer practice. or go to school. or go to the beach. So Im going to go back and Im going to say. Ill tell you what. we gave you some help. Were going to raise the price of gas and oil and were buying bicycles.,R,Mr. BAIRD,2008-04-22,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise on this occasion. again I mention it is on Earth Day. to seek support for House Resolution 891. as amended. celebrating 35 years of spacebased observation of the Earth by the Landsat spacecraft. This resolution celebrates the worlds longest unbroken record of civil Earth observations of the land beginning with the launch of the first Landsat satellite on July 23. 1972. The data collected from Landsat satellites have helped advance our scientific understanding of global change and fostered applications .that benefit our private sector. as well as our State. local. regional and Federal Government activities. Mr. Speaker. the scientific and applied uses of these spacebased land observations are vast. Landsat data are used to monitor crop patterns. manage natural resources such as water and forests. assist in land use and urban growth planning. help protect wildlife habitats and support national security objectives. to. name just a few examples. Landsats 35 year data record has also been critical in helping to understand the interactions between land cover changes and variations in the Earths climate. The most recent report of the U.S. Climate Change Science Program Report references Landsat as one of two critical satellites. It states. ""Without these satellite observations. the current pace of discovery and innovation in global land use and land cover change climate research would not be possible."" Mr. Speaker. this celebration of Landsats continuous 35 years record of land observations provides a clear example of the societal benefits derived from our Nations space program. But there is more to be gained from Landsat data. Increases in computing and communications capabilities are stimulating innovative approaches to using Earth observations data such as Landsat. One need only look to the Internet. where anyone can access images of neighborhoods. cities and regions to see firsthand the ways in which Landsat data are finding their ways into our lives. Mr. Speaker. in reflecting on the contributions that Landsat has made over the past 35 years and the growing applications of these data. we must remember that the success of Landsat begins and continues with people. We owe our gratitude to the many talented and hardworking scientists. engineers and othbr professionals who have been involved in the Landsat program. I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 891. As we address the implications of climate change and the pressure on our environment and resources. it is important that we ensure the continuation of the Landsat program and ensure the research. technology and educational investments that are required to expand the use of Landsat data and the benefits they provide to science and society.

Mr. SHIMKUS,2008-04-30,Thank you. And I have a few comments. Immediately after you mentioned Mac Thornberrys bill. I also signed onto the No More Excuses Energy Act. The school bus folks were in town today. and what I have really gotten an appreciation of over the past year is. as I said earlier. how energy costs affect everything. Look at the cost to the local school district. who is paying for the school buses to pick up the kids. The prices of diesel fuel are double. Its not planned in the budget. How are they going to meet these costs? Many will have to go back to the voters of the local control school that we have. and theyre going to have to raise taxes to pay for it. Theres no benefit to that for the kids. I mean theyre still driving the same buses. That is a lost opportunity for money to go in a different direction to help educate kids but now has to go to fund the transportation system to get kids to school. So I appreciate those comments.,R,Mr. BAIRD,2008-04-22,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker.
