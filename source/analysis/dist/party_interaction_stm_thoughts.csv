4,3000,"Madam President. I had intended to offer an amendment today to begin monitoring of mercury emissions from coalfired power plants and include this information in the Toxic Release Inventory. Congress has a long track record of supporting the publics ""right to know"" about the nature and volume of toxic chemicals that are being released into the environment from manufacturing facilities in their neighborhoods. The ""Toxics Release Inventory"" has empowered citizens and communities and is helping local and state environmental agencies to identify the most pressing problems within their neighborhoods. A glaring gap in information from the Inventory is mercury emissions from coalfired power plants. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that at least 52 tons of mercury are being released to the environment each year. every year. from these plants. When Congress amended the Clean Air Act in 1990. we did not address mercury emissions but instead required EPA to report back to Congress on the sources. impacts and control strategies for mercury. Congress finally received that report last year and now needs to act on it. That is why I introduced the ""Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 1998."" Although I will not offer my mercury righttoknow amendment today. Congress has a responsibility to act on the EPA Mercury Report to Congress. I believe Senator CHAFEE who is one of the leading proponents of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. agrees with me that steps should be taken to address mercury emissions.",USA
4,14743,Wherever we are dirtying this air. it is dangerous to the lungs. and it is dangerous to the health. According to the Environmental Protection Agency. 127 million Americans breathe air that violates Federal standards for smog and soot pollutions. EPAs own consultants found that each year almost 370 residents of the DallasFort Worth area died just because of pollution from the oldest and dirtiest unregulated power plants in the country. and 10.500 asthma attacks are triggered. During the past several years. EPA gave several metropolitan areas a free pass. extending air deadlines for dirty areas without bumping them up to the higher pollution categories that would require more protective standards. Four separate Federal appellate courts all ruled that EPAs extension policy violated the language and purpose of the Clean Air Act. Appropriately. that led the agency to abandon the policy. With so many Americans breathing in dirty air. it should be obvious that air quality standards are already not being enforced enough. Why would we make them weaker? But rather than accepting the judgment of the EPA and the courts. the gentlemanfrom Texas,USA
4,25522,"Mr. Chairman. before I begin. I would like to commend the gentleman from Washington and Chairman DICKS and the gentleman from Kansas for their good work on this underlying bill. The amendment I offered today stems directly from concerns I have over a recently proposed rule by the Environmental Protection Agency that could radically alter the current interpretation of the Clean Air Act and adversely impact public health. On December 21 last year. 4 days before Christmas. EPA introduced a cleverly timed proposal that would essentially weaken hazardous air pollutant emission standards for major sources of pollution as defined by section 112 of the Clean Air Act. My amendment would prohibit the use of fiscal year 2008 funds by EPA to promulgate this illadvised and environmentally dangerous proposal. Currently. major sources. major source polluters. facilities thAt emit 10 tons per year of a single air toxin or 25 tons per year of any combination of toxic pollutants are required to comply with the Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards. called MACT. permanently. a policy adopted in 1995 known as Once In. Always In."" MACT standards are technologybased area emission standards established under title 3 of the 1990 Clean Air Act amendment. Compliance with MACT standards can require facility owners and operators to meet emission limits. install emission control technologies. monitor emissions and/or operating parameters and use specified work practices. These public safeguard standards have proven most effective in reducing toxic. harmful. cancercausing eye pollutants such as mercury. chlorine. benzene. methanol and asbestos. If EPAs proposed rule were to take effect. industrial facilities could emit hazardous air pollutants at levels just below 10/25 major sourc.e thresholds and not be subject to the MACT standards. This move has been criticized by the State clean air agencies. our regional officers. our major metropolitan leaders. as well as the county leaders and environmental groups. A majority of EPAs own regional offices initially excluded from viewing and providing input on the proposed policy have been highly critical of the proposed rule citing health and emission concerns. EPA has done very little to justify such a dramatic shift in congressional intent or the agencys own longstanding interpretation. Moreover. the Agency has performed very little. if any. substantive emissions analysis. and they have performed""no public health analysis for any industrial sector. In my view the Agencys proposed rule represents another installment of regulatory attacks designed to gut the Clean Air Act. The public health of this Nation should not be forced to take the back seat to the interest of big polluters. The congressional authorities captured in section 112 of Clean Air Act are intended to ensure that major source emitters of hazardous air pollutants are required to comply with MACT standards permanently to ensure that the elimination of air toxics are achieved and maintained in the interest of public health. In 1995. upon adoption of the ""once in. always in"" policy. EPA stated the following: ""EPA believes that this once in. always -in policy follows most naturally from the language and structure of the [Clean Air Act] statute. In many cases. application of MACT will reduce a major emitters emissions to levels substantially below the major thresholds. ""Without a once in. always in policy. these facilities could ""backslide from MACT control. levels by obtaining potentialtoemit limits. escaping applicability of the MACT standard. and increasing emissions to the major source threshold. ""Thus. the maximum achievable emission reductions that Congress mandated from major sources would not be achieved. ""A once in. always in policy ensures that MACT emission reductions are permanent. and that the health and environment protection provided by MACT standards is not undermined."" In the Federal Register. the Agency raged on and on about how great the proposed rule is for major source polluters. because it will create incentives for indiistry to reduce emissions.",USA
4,41366,In particular. mercury exposure can cause great harm to pregnant women. unborn babies. and young children by damaging their developing nervous systems. which affects childrens ability to learn and to think. Additionally. mercury emissions can also damage the environment by polluting our Nations lakes and streams and the seafood which we eat. In fact. EPA estimates that H.R. 2681 will allow for thousands of additional premature deaths and premature heart attacks. as well as tens of thousands of additional asthma attacks that could have been avoided. Mr. Chairman. the public health benefits from the reduction of air toxics emissions from cement kilns have already been delayed long enough. Now is the time. The radical Republican majority cannot keep making excuses and exceptions for the largest industrial emitters of mercury in the U.S.. cement plants and industrial boilers. while over 100 other industries have already controlled their air toxic pollution.,USA
4,46256,Madam Chair. I rise in strong opposition to this bill. As far as I am concerned. this is just another attack on the EPA. Some of my colleagues have spent hundreds of hours this session attacking the EPA. May I remind them that Congress set up the EPA to regulate dangerous and toxic substances in order to keep our air and water clean. We must continue to support the EPA in this task. Who would not want clean air and clean water? I think the EPA does a fine job in protecting us. My district has one of the highest asthma rates in the country. It is one of the reasons that I championed clean energy and have argued for strong EPA rules to help protect our children. If this bill had been law already. the EPA could have been delayed or blocked from finalizing the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. which set emissions limits for new coal- and oilfired power plants for mercury and other toxic air pollutants. Why would anyone want to block the EPA from doing that? The EPA estimates that these new standards will save up to 11.000 lives and prevent 130.000 asthma attacks. Thats good enough for me. There are many. many reasons to continue to support the EPA. This bill. unfortunately. does not do that. so I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill and to support the EPA in a goal we should all share of protecting our air and water.,USA
4,46234,"Mr. Chair. in December 2008 an impoundment holding disposed ash waste generated by the Tennessee Valley Authority broke open. creating a massive spill in Kingston. TN. The spill covered the surrounding land and Clinch River with one billion gallons of coal ash. displaced residents. and resulted in $1.2 billion in cleanup costs. The accident underscored the need for rules to ensure structural stability and safety of coal ash impoundments given that U.S. electric utilities generate 130 million tons of coal ash every year. In response. the Environmental Protection Agency proposed the firstever regulations to ensure the safe disposal and management of coal ash from coalfired power plants under the Nations primary law for regulating solid waste. the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. RCRA. In June 2010. the EPA presented two regulatory options: regulating coal ash as hazardous waste under Subtitle C or regulating coal ash as a nonhazardous waste under Subtitle D. The EPA has not established a deadline for the final rule. I have serious concerns that designating coal ash as a hazardous material. the result of regulating coal ash under Subtitle C. could have major impacts on the recycling and reuse of coal ash to manufacture wallboard. roofing materials and bricks. and especially concrete. In 2008 alone. the concrete industry used 15.8 million tons of coal ash in the manufacturing of ready mixed concrete making it the most widely used supplemental cementing material. When combined with cement. coal ash improves the durability. strength. constructability. and economy of concrete. It also has huge environmental benefits. Using coal ashan industrial byproductin concrete results in longer lasting structures and reduction in the amount of waste materials sent to landfills. raw materials extracted. energy required for production. and air emissions. including carbon dioxide. A ""hazardous"" designation of coal ash could put these benefits in jeopardy. It could make coal ash storage and transportation more expensive. and create a legal environment that would deter cement manufacturers from recycling coal ash in cement production. The result would not only be devastating for the cement manufacturing industry and American jobs. it could also divert millions of tons of coal ash from beneficial uses to surface impoundments like the one that broke open in Kingston. Tennessee. For these reasons. my preference is for EPA to regulate coal ash under Subtitle D of the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act. This would ensure we have strong regulations for surface impoundments of coal ash needed to protect public health and the environment without inhibiting the recycling and reuse of coal ash. To ensure EPA gets that message. I supported H.R. 2273 in 2011. The Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act was not a perfect bill. In fact. this bill could have been much simpler and likely noncontroversial if my Republican colleagues had just legislated Subtitle D of RCRA. It was my hope that the U.S. Senate would take this more targeted approach. Thankfully. in June of 2013. the EPA published a Federal Register notice indicating a preference for regulating coal ash under subtitle D. I appreciate EPAs willingness to be pragmatic and balance the needs of recyclers to achieve greater environmental protection. Today we are voting on H.R. 2218. the latest version of the Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act. While the bill has been marginally improved. I believe it is no longer necessary. Assuming the EPA regulates coal ash under Subtitle D. the recycling and reuse of coal ash will not be jeopardized. eliminating the need for legislation. By voting against H.R. 2218. I am thanking EPA for its pragmatic reconsideration of the June 2010 draft rule and for providing certainty for coal ash recyclers.",USA
4,19066,Mr. President. I rise today to express my outrage that my colleagues and I have to fend off yet another attack on the environment by the Bush administration. I am appalled that instead of taking steps toward improving air quality by implementing stricter CAFE standards. reducing greenhouse gas emissions. and other positive measures. the Bush rule takes a giant step backward. Indeed. the mercury rule put forth by the Bush administration takes American environmental policy back at least 5 years. In 2000. the Environmental Protection Agency determined that powerplants must be regulated under the Clean Air Act because they are the largest remaining sources of mercury pollution and are. therefore. a public health risk. Up until the spring of 2003. EPA was working toward finalizing an effective regulatory policy to reduce mercury emissions from powerplants by over 90 percent beginning in 2008. But in 2003. the Bush administration reversed course by developing this new rule that exempts powerplants from any regulation under the Clean Air Act. Bowing to industry pressure. the Bush rule will do nothing to reduce emissions for at least a decade and once implemented. will only reduce mercury emissions to approximately onethird of what the Clean Air Act requires. This decision is irresponsible in light of all of the evidence about the dangers of mercury emissions. Mr. President. mercury emissions are continuing to grow and are endangering the health of American families across the country. I am proud to say that my State. New Jersey. has taken the helm on reducing its own instate emissions. Last year. New Jersey adopted stringent rules on mercury emissions from coalfired powerplants. iron and steel melters. and municipal solid waste incinerators. New Jerseys rules set the goal of reducing emissions from instate coalfired plants by 90 percent by the year 2007. By taking this hard line on mercury. my State will reduce its mercury emissions by over 1.500 pounds of mercury each year. While New Jersey has implemented this aggressive strategy in the fight to protect the public from mercury exposure. the new Bush administration rule undermines these efforts. More than onethird of mercury deposition in New Jersey comes from outofstate sources. Instead of allowing more mercury emissions from coalfired plants. shouldnt the Federal Government be strengthening its laws by requiring States to adopt strict rules similar to New Jerseys? Instead. it is removing powerplants from the list of pollution sources subject to stringent pollution controls under the Federal Clean Air Act. Why does the administration want to undercut States. such as New Jersey. that are making the right decision? Thankfully. New Jersey has not backed down. and stands by its goal to reduce mercury emissions. In fact. New Jersey spearheaded a multistate lawsuit challenging the EPAs rule delisting powerplants as a source of mercury pollution. Fourteen States have joined New Jerseys challenge to this rule because it violates the Clean Air Act and fails to protect the public adequately from the harmful mercury emissions from coalfired powerplants. The health effects of mercury are no secret. Mercury is a known neurotoxin that can cause severe neurological and developmental problems. Developing fetuses and children are the most vulnerable to the effects of mercury contamination. The threat is so severe that the National Academy of Sciences recommends that pregnant and nursing mothers not eat more than 6 ounces of fish per month. Even by EPAs own estimates. more than 600.000 infants are born each year with blood mercury levels higher than 5.8 parts per billion. the EPA level of concern. That is 600.000 children who are at risk of harmful impacts on cognitive thinking. memory. attention. language. and fine motor and visual spatial skills. Some studies indicate that mercury could even be linked to the skyrocketing number of autism cases across the country. The numbers continue to astonish. Fish from waters in 45 of our 50 States have been declared unsafe to eat as a result of poisoning from mercury. In New Jersey alone. there are mercury consumption advisories for at least one species of fish in almost every body of water in the State. Knowing these health risks. we cannot be complacent about this new rule. How can we sit back and let powerplants. the Nations worst mercury polluters. reduce their mercury emissions by such a drastically different rate than what the Clean Air Act requires? This is morally repugnant. irresponsible and just plain wrong. We have the technology to control mercury emissionsthat is not the problem. The problem is that industry does not want to be accountable for the costs of polluting. and the Bush administration is letting them get away with that. Instead. the public will incur the health costs of not reducing emissions. Once again. it is clear that the administration has no problem letting big industry off the hook at the expense of the publics health. The science is behind us and the technology available to reduce human exposure to mercury. We cannot retreat. we must move forward and protect our Nations children. I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.,USA
4,4225,"Mr. President. I rise today to introduce a bill along with my colleague Senator INHOFE. which makes a technical correction to the Safe Drinking Water Act. This bill will end a frivolous lawsuit. clarify the intent of Congress and allow our State regulators and the Environmental Protection Agency to focus on protecting underground drinking water. This bill clarifies the Safe Drinking Water Act by exempting hydraulic fracturing from the definition of underground injection. Hydraulic fracturing is a process used in the production of coalbed methane. This process uses high pressure water. carbon dioxide and sand to create microscopic fractures in coal seams to release and extract methane. oil and gas. Most states in which hydraulic fracturingis used. including my own state of Alabama. have in place regulations to ensure hydraulic fracturing continues to be a technique used in a safe manner. This technique has been used safely by coalbed methane. oil and gas producers for over fifteen years and has never been attributed to causing even a single case of contamination to an underground drinking water source. . On May 3rd of 1994. the Legal Environmental Assistance Foundation (LEAF) submitted a Petition for Promulgation of a Rule to withdraw the EPAs approval for the state of Alabamas Underground Injection Control (UIC) program. LEAF cited a case in Alabama of alleged drinking well contamination to justify its lawsuit. The EPA carefully* reviewed this petition and on May 5th of 1995 the Administrator of the EPA. Carol Browner wrote to LEAF and stated ""based on that review. I have determined that Alabamas implementation of the UIC program is consistent with the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act"". Administrator Browner continued ""There is no evidence that the hydraulic fracturing at issue has resulted in any contamination or endangerment of underground sources of drinking water"". I ask unanimous consent that a complete copy of the text of that letter be inserted into the RECORD.",USA
4,41303,Mr. Chairman. before I yield. I want to indicate that Mr. WHITFIELD just argued that this bill will not harm public health because although it blocks two critical rules to clean up old power plants. it doesnt repeal the Clean Air Interstate Rule. or the CAIR rule. Well. leaving an inadequate rule in place does not achieve the health benefits lost by blocking the Mercury Air Toxics Rule and the CrossState Air Pollution Rule. The CAIR rule was blocked by the courts. They found it didnt comply with the Clean Air Act because it did not effectively address pollution that crosses State lines. That means that States suffering from upwind pollution have to look for additional. more costly. pollution reductions from smaller local sources. and it does not require power plants to clean up mercury and other toxic air pollution. His statement was absolutely incorrect. At this time I want to yield 3 minutes to a very important member of our committee. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY from the State of Illinois.,USA
4,41783,"Mr. President. I rise to discuss S.J. Res. 27. a resolution of disapproval of the crossState air pollution rule. I appreciate my friend. the Senator from Kentucky. for bringing his concerns forward through this resolution. However. this is an issue I have been extensively involved in as New Hampshires former attorney general. and I believe this resolution is misguided. This issue requires a balanced approach. and when looking at environmental regulations. we must review each on a casebycase basis. In that vein. I cannot support this resolution. The crossState air pollution rule is designed to control emissions of air pollution that cause air quality problems in downwind Statesand New Hampshire is a downwind Stateand is estimated to reduce powerplant sulfur dioxide emissions by 73 percent and emissions from nitrogen oxides by 54 percent from 2005 levels. It is important to note that similar pollution standards have been in place for 6 yearsfirst implemented by the Bush administration in 2005and many utilities have already taken steps to comply with the rule. The rule encourages the use of the best technology available so downwind States such as New Hampshire will be able to achieve national clean air standards. Without this rule in place. New Hampshire will be unable to achieve national clean air standards due to air pollution that is outside the States regulatory control and comes from other States. In New Hampshire. we have a long. bipartisan tradition of working to advance commonsense. balanced environmental protections. That is the perspective from which I approach this resolution. From my time as the States attorney general. I understand well that New Hampshire is one of several downwind States in what is infamously known as ""Americas tailpipe."" For far too long. air pollution generated by Midwestern coalfired powerplants has been allowed to flow into the jetstream unabated and to settle in New England. leading to diminished air quality in my home State of New Hampshire. As attorney general. I worked to protect Granite State residents and our environment from air pollutants generated by Midwest coalfired powerplants. The reality is that air pollution does not stop at State borders. and New Hampshire should not be the tailpipe for pollutants from outofState powerplants. It is a matter of common sense to ensure that one States emissions of pollutants do not unduly harm another States air quality. I urge my colleagues to oppose the resolution of disapproval.",USA
4,12636,"I am aware of the report to which my hon. Friend referred—he is right to be concerned about this important matter, especially the impact on children. The latest research on the causes of asthma shows that there is no evidence that air pollution causes asthma, but there is certainly evidence that it exacerbates or may bring on attacks in people who already have asthma. We have therefore asked the Government's expert Committee on Medical Effects of Air Pollutants to provide further advice next year.",UK
4,13710,"I thank the Minister for his answer and I commend the Government for the work that they have done. However, conditions such as asthma are greatly exacerbated by pollution. Pollution may not cause it, but, as I know from my experience, it certainly makes it worse. The number of asthma sufferers now totals 5 million. Has the Minister examined the research on the effects of long-term air pollution carried out by the air pollution unit of the Department of Health? When will the measures that he has announced have a significant effect on air pollution, so that conditions such as asthma can be significantly ameliorated?",UK
4,4610,"Of course I will refer the hon. Gentleman's comments to my colleagues in other Departments, but the simple reality is that MOX is a better way to dispose of spent uranium through reprocessing. The advantage of MOX is that, in refuelling, the plutonium is destroyed. Therefore, the proliferation risks from plutonium disappear with that reprocessing cycle. It is a very environmentally and ecologically sound way to get rid of the dangers of proliferation.",UK
4,13702,"We have met, or are on course to meet, air quality objectives for five of the nine pollutants in England—namely benzene, 1,3-butadiene, carbon monoxide, lead and sulphur dioxide. Significant progress has been made towards meeting air quality objectives for nitrogen dioxide, particles, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and ozone. That is a result of the measures that have been implemented to reduce emissions of these pollutants, and their precursors, particularly from road transport and industry.",UK
4,52382,"The committee on the medical effects of air pollution estimates that 60,000 deaths a year occur in Britain because of the effects of air pollution. That is 20 times the number killed in all road traffic accidents. The Government state that they will not achieve their legal limit on oxides of nitrogen pollutants until 2030. Is this not a disgraceful situation? What will the Government do to take on Volkswagen, which has been accused of causing 12,000 avoidable deaths in Britain alone by gross deception in relation to their vehicles? What is the Minister doing to accelerate the clean-up of NOx air pollution in this country?",UK
4,41476,"My hon. Friend has been vigilant in writing to me about this product, produced by 4Recycling Ltd. I must set straight for the record that the product, potassic lime, is a mixture of water treatment work sludge and cement kiln dust. A current analysis of the product shows that it contains contaminated products, such as lead. The caution that the Environment Agency has exercised is therefore something that I am sure all Members of the House would understand, but I would be happy to meet my hon. Friend to discuss it further.",UK
4,10482,"In view of the very high rate of asthma in my constituency, will the Prime Minister look at yesterday's report on lung diseases from the British Thoracic Society, showing that they kill even more people than heart diseases or cancer, and occur at nearly twice the European average? Will he ensure that we tackle those diseases with as much determination as we tackle heart disease and cancer by offering medical treatment and preventive measures such as action on air pollution and smoking?",UK
4,13712,"My hon. Friend makes a very good point. Ozone levels in rural areas are a problem, and we are not satisfied with the progress that has been made. It should be remembered that ozone is a highly trans-boundary pollutant and we are taking measures nationally to control ozone precursors, such as nitrogen dioxide and volatile organic compounds. Internationally agreed measures are the most effective ways to tackle that pollutant, as ground-level ozone concentrations in southern England are influenced largely by trans-boundary pollution. The UK will play a key role in seeking agreements on those issues, and my hon. Friend is right to highlight them as an area for concern.",UK
4,11576,"That is a subject of ongoing dialogue. In 1995, a committee reported on the medical effects of air pollutants. There was little evidence that air pollution causes asthma, although it was accepted that exposure to air pollutants could worsen the symptoms of asthma. Again, the issue is about causes rather than the exacerbation of the disease, but we do not have strong evidence. It has been conjectured that modern fuels are more polluting than those used in the past, but there is no hard evidence of a direct causal link. One would expect there to be more asthma in urban communities where there is more traffic than in rural communities but, interestingly, there is no difference between the two; the link is clearly not as established as one might think from anecdotal evidence.",UK
4,2869,"The Department of Health's Committee on Medical Effects of Air Pollutants estimates that, each year, between 12,000 and 24,000 deaths are brought forward by short-term exposure to certain air pollutants from all sources, including traffic.
It is, at present, not possible to say by how much lives are shortened. It is also not possible to attribute a proportion of those effects to traffic alone.",UK
