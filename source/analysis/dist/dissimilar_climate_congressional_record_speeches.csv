2009-04-27,0,Mr. SCALISE,2009-04-27,Well. I thank the gentleman and the doctor from Georgia. As you said. I am not a doctor. and I dont play one on TV. but I do enjoy serving with you on the Energy and Commerce Committee. where we do deal with the policies that actually address the health care issues in our country. which are very important. One of our newest Members. somebody who I am proud to serve with in my State delegation. a new Member from Shreveport. Louisiana. who happens to be a doctor and a very able student on these issues. is my friend Dr. FLEMING. who I am going to yield time to now.,R,Mr. OBERSTAR,2009-04-27,Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Despite all of the concern about global climaue change and climate warming and of the melting of the glaciersand the last great glacier did melt and retreat some 10.000 years agoevery November. it makes a comeback in the northern tier States. especially on the Great Lakes. As the cold winds sweep down from the Arctic regions across Canada and as the ice gathers on the shores and extends across. still occasionally. although it has been several years. Lake Superior does freeze completely over. When it doesnt freeze completely over. an ice sheet extends a long distance out from the shoreline. clogging the navigation channels. making transit difficult on the Sault Sainte Marie. on the St. Marys River and down into the lower lakes where. from midNovember through midJanuary and then again in early spring. our Great Lakes bulk carriers must make that transit to deliver iron ore.to the steel mills in the lower lake ports and coal from the Potter -River Basin in WyomingMontana that comes by unit train to the ports of Duluth and Superior. and they must transit that coal to lower lake coal facilities. The lowest cost. mlost energyefficient and * most environmentally friendly means of moving bulk commodities are by waterway. and this great waterway of the Great Lakes is absolutely critical. During the 20062007 winter season. 10.5 million tons of iron ore moved during the winter shipping season. That ore supports 100.000 jobs at lower lake steel mills. 300.000 jobs at associated industries. In the same winter months. some 6.5 million tons of coal were shipped on the Great Lakes to supply the power plants in lower lake communities with their coal facilities. but We dont have enough icebreaking capacity to keep those channels open. to keep the ports open. to escort vessels through the heavy ice era in the fall and in the early spring. The Coast Guard. which does its very best with the Mackinaw and with some smaller harbor icebreakers. has made a valiant effort. but the shippers on the Great Lakes. in particular in this past season. said they have frequently had a laker moving out but impeded by ice. The Mackinaw could break a channel. but then it would be on call in the lower lake ports. and the smaller harbor icebreakers couldnt keep the channel open for those 60.000ton vessels to move iron ore or aggregate or sand and gravel or limestone as needed in the iron ore production process. So the clear call from Great Lakes port and shipping and shipper interests has been add an icebreaker. a real companion to the Mackinaw. The previous Mackinaw icebreaker was built in 1940 and served 60 years and. finally. was gracefully retired. but its replacement simply cant be in two places at once. If were going to keep our economy moving and our economy functioning effectively. we need that icebreaking capability in the upper lakes and in the lower lakes. often at the same time on the same days. So with two icebreakers. our Great Lakes economy will be able to function effectively. I reserve the balance of my time. Madam Speaker.,D,0.4447128
2009-04-27,1,Mr. CRAPO,2009-04-27,Madam President. in midJune. I asked Idahoans to share with me how high energy prices are affecting their lives. and they responded by the hundreds. The stories. numbering well -over 1.200. are heartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent weeks. the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the efforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts. I am submitting every email sent to me through an address set up specifically for this purpose to an issue that will be easily resolved. but it is one that deserves immediate and serious attention. and Idahoans deserve to be heard. Their stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday expenses. but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what Congress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last beyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have todays letters printed in the RECORD.,R,Mr. OBERSTAR,2009-04-27,Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume.

2011-02-08,0,Mr. BURTON of Indiana,2011-02-08,Madam Speaker. as a followup to what was just said by my colleague from Pennsylvania. we all know about the problems in the Middle East. Theres a real problem in Egypt. We dont know about that government. how its going to turn out. Theres problems in the gulf states. theres problems in other parts of the Middle East. and we get at least 30 percent of our energy from that area. We also get about 20 percent of our energy from Venezuela. and the President down there. Mr. Chavez. is no friend of ours. If we dont move toward energy independence and theres a real problem in the Middle East. weve got problems here in this country. Can you imagine what would happen if we had 30 percent of our energy cut off because there was a blockage of the Suez Canal or the Straits of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf? We must move toward energy independence. The President is blocking us from getting permits to drill in the gulf. we cant drill in the ANWR. we cant drill off the continental shelf. we cant use coal shale to produce oil. We have enough energy in this country to move to energy independence in 10 years with natural gas and these other fossil fuels. But the President will not move. Were not going to solve this problem with windmills and solar energy. Weve got to solve it with the energy that we have before us right now. Its in our national security and our economic security that we ought to do this.,R,Mr. HOLT,2011-02-08,I would urge you to put your comment in the conditional. This is not going to happen. We are not going to let it happen. It would be so unwise to say were not going to follow the science. It would be so unwise to say to the young people. were going to turn away from this innovative challenge. It would be so unwise to say to families with asthma. were not going to make the atmosphere better.,D,0.5639695

Its in our national security and our economic security that we ought to do this.,R,Mr. HOLT,2011-02-08,Undoing the Clean Air Act makes the air less clean. The Clean Air Act has been successful in reducing into the atmosphere the emissions of pollutants/chemicals that kill people. The Clean Air Act has been successful. And what do we have before us? Well. tomorrow. as you say. there will be a hearing on legislation not yet in final formlets hope that it never finds its way into final form. It is legislation that would gut the Clean Air Act. It would prevent the Clean Air Act from keeping up with the times. It would prevent the Clean Air Act from continuing to protect Americans by removing dangerous chemicals from the atmosphere. This is really a matter of public health. and it is also a matter of economics. The cost of clean air safeguards has been exaggerated over the years. I rememberand I think my colleagues are old enough to remember. I certainly amwhen the Clean Air Act was passed. At the time. they said. Oh. this is going to be terrible. Its going to ruin industry. You know. claims about the cost of sulphur dioxide standards were exaggerated by factors ofI dont know5 or 10. You know. weve seen from the market price of the sulfur dioxide allowances that the actual market is much less than the estimated cost of complying with the sulfur dioxide regulations. So. again and again. these have been exaggerated. and by implementing the Clean Air Act. we have saved lives and. by association. by extension. saved dollars. Furthermore. if the Clean Air Act is allowed to continue to look after the air that you and I breathe. it will lead to further efficiency and all of the burgeoning industries that you. my colleague from New York. and you. my colleague from Washington. have talked about. This is going to be very good for the United States to be able to sell these environmentally attractive technologies to the rest of the world rather than to buy them. So. for all sorts of reasons. we simply cannot afford the proposal of whats coming from the majority on the other side of the aisle that would increase our dependence on foreign oil. that would leave the air less breathable. that would aggravate asthma and heart disease. and would end up undoing the Clean Air Act. What Congress should be doing is making it possible for the Clean Air Act to continue to protect Americans health and lives. not undoing it.,D,0.6929784
2014-05-01,0,Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania,2014-05-01,Mr. Speaker. a recent Monthly Labor Review report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics reiterates that energy production and energy jobs are surging in parts of the country. including my home State of Pennsylvania. The report. which reviews employment trends from 2007 to 2012. states: Pennsylvania has seen a surge in natural gas production and employment over the past 2 years. resulting in substantial growth in terms of both employment and wages. Over the reports study period. Pennsylvania went on from being the tenth largest State by oil and natural gas employment in 2007 to being the sixth largest in 2012. and the Commonwealth also had the second largest employment increase over the same period. positioning itself only after Texas. We talk a lot about what Washington can do to boost growth and employment. Well. Mr. Speaker. this report speaks to the fact that we should allow private innovation in States like Pennsylvania to lead the way.,R,Ms. DELAURO,2014-05-01,Mr. Speaker. it is the lunch hour here in Washington. D.C.. but for the over 840 million people around the world who are struggling with hunger. an adequate lunch is a luxury they cannot afford. Instead of enjoying food. they are facing a terrible. gnawing pain in their gut right now. By the time I finish this statement. six children will have perished because of hunger or inadequate nutrition. This week. the World Food Program is asking everyone to try to Live Below the Lineto put yourself in the shoes of the hungry. and to try to get by on only $1.50 of food per daythe purchasing power of people living in extreme poverty. as defined by the World Bank. I and members of my staff are taking this challenge. But for millions of people. this is not about 1 day or 1 week. This is about their everyday lives. It should not be this way. As President Kennedy said over 50 years ago: We have the ability. we have the means. and we have the capacity to eliminate hunger from the face of the Earth. We need only the will. In the past. Republicans like Bob Dole and Democrats like George McGovern came together. They led this battle against global hunger. Today. we have a moral obligation to continue that battle. to meet our responsibilities to our fellow man and womanand to our childrenand to do what we can to end the scourge of hunger in our own Nation and around the world. Mr. Speaker. lets take advantage of this challenge. Let us end hunger in this generation.,D,0.5247267
2014-05-01,1,Mr. COLE,2014-05-01,Madam Chairman. thank you for the recognition. and I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 4487. the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2015. provides $3.3 billion for the operations of the legislative branch. excluding Senate items. The recommendation is the equivalent to the fiscal year 2014 level and a decrease of $122.5 million. or 3.7 percent. from the requested level. Conforming with the longstanding practice under which each body of Congress determines its own housekeeping requirements and the other concurs without intervention. funds for the Senate are not included in the bill as reported by the committee. Through seven hearings and meetings with agency heads. the committee listened to all who presented their respective concerns and budget requests. It was necessary to make some critical decisions and prioritize programs. and we did this in a bipartisan and transparent manner. We are presenting to the House today a bill that is fiscally responsible and maintains current operations for the Legislative Branch agencies. The bill includes $1.2 billion for the operations of the House. This is equivalent to the fiscal year 2014 enacted level and $20 million below the request. It is worthy to note that the funding provided for Members Representational Allowances and Committees provides for the current operations. and I do not anticipate further reductions in the coming year. The bill also includes the Members pay freeze for fiscal year With this bill. total funding for the House of Representatives is 14 percent below fiscal year 2010. The bill includes $348 million for the Capitol Police. This is $9.5 million above the fiscal year 2014 enacted level and $77 million less than the requested level. This will support 1.775 sworn officers and 370 civilian positions. A slight increase above last year is provided to ensure the Capitol Police maintain current operations and ensure missionessential training. Knowing that access to the House office buildings is of critical concern to Members. we directed that the Chief of Police develop an action plan that will make sure public access to our buildings is easily accessible during heightened periods of visitation. The implementation of this plan is in the early stages. and we will continue to monitor the budgetary impacts to the Capitol Police. The bill includes $45.7 million for the Congressional Budget Office. This is at the fiscal year 2014 enacted level and $378.000 below the requested level. The bill includes $488.6 million for the Architect of the Capitol. excluding Senate items. This is a decrease of $40.5 million from the fiscal year 2014 enacted level and $79 million below the requested level. Within the recommended level. the committee continues its prioritization of projects that promote the safety and public health of workers and occupants. decrease the deferred maintenance backlog. and invest to achieve future energy savings. The committee recognizes the continuing challenge of preserving and maintaining our infrastructure and prioritizing critical projects in the current budgetary environment. It is important to note that $21 million is recommended for the final phase of dome restoration. a very high priority of this committee. In addition. we are continuing the 5year practice of including funds for the House Historic Buildings Revitalization Trust Fund. a fund established by,R,Ms. DELAURO,2014-05-01,Mr. Speaker. it is the lunch hour here in Washington.
