1,14742,Mr. Speaker. I will put into the RECORD data by the Texas Environmental Air Quality Commission that shows the monitoring in Ellis County has not exceeded one time the standard. not one time. Now. there are monitors in Arlington. Texas. that have. and that is also in my district. but if a reference is to Ellis County. the data shows that there have not been any exceedences. I do not know which part of my district she was referring to. but if it is Ellis County. we are okay in Ellis County. If it is part of Arlington that I represent. then we have had an exceedence. The data Is for ozone exceedences In Dallas/Fort Worth area in 2002 and 2003 (through 10/28/2003). Measured values for Midlothian Tower C94/ C158/C160 show 91 ppb on 15 May 2002. 86 ppb on 22 June 2002. 90 ppb on 23 June 2002. 85 ppb on 24 June 2002. 87 ppb on 8 July 2002. 88 ppb on 7 August 2002. 87 ppb on 8 August 2002. 99 ppb on 9 August 2002. 94 ppb on 11 September 2002. 86 ppb on 13 September 2002. 89 ppb on 28 May 2003. 86 ppb on 9 June 2003. and 89 ppb on 6 August,USA
1,34119,Mr. Chairman. this amendment would initiate a rulemaking process by the FAA to determine whether Westchester County Airport may reinstate its overnight aircraft restrictions. Owned and operated by Westchester County. the airport. has had voluntary restrictions between midnight and 6:30 a.m. since its mandatory curfew was removed in the early. 1980s. For nearly twenty years. all of the operators at the airport were abiding by the voluntary curfew. However. business at the airport has expanded tremendously. with more and more flights disregarding the curfew. whichÂ• disrupts communities throughout the ovemight hours and makes the Countys environmental upkeep in the area more demanding. Just miles trom New York City. this airport is an important gateway for commercial and business aircraft in the area. However. it was never designed to accommodate so many aircraft. Bound by the borders of New York and Connecticut. the airports physical infrastructure cannot expand further.,USA
1,5586,Mr. President. I rise to draw attention.to a problem my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have no doubt .encounteredpoor air quality on commercial airline flights. Cabin environmental issues have been a part of air travel since the inception of commercial aircraft almost 70 years ago. However. with the exception of the ban on smoking on domestic flights in 1990. no major changes have occurred to improve the quality of air on commercial flights. Commercial airplanes operate in an environment hostile to human life. According to Boeing. the conditions existing outside an airplane cabin at modern cruise altitudes off 35.000 feet. are no more survivable by humans than those conditions that would be encountered outside a submarine at extreme ocean depths. To make air travel more conducive to passengers and flight crews. airplanes are equipped with advanced Environmental Control Systems. While these systems are designed to control cabin pressurization. ventilation and temperature control. they have not diminished the number of health complaints reported by travelers. It should come as no surprise to my colleagues that the most common complaints from passengers and flight crew are headaches. dizziness. irritable eyes and noses. and exposure to cold and flu. With the amount we travel. I would not be surprised to learn some of my friends in the Senate have suffered some of these symptoms themselves. But complaints of illness do not stop there. Some passengers complaints are as serious as chest pains or nervous system disorders. This is a serious consideration and should be addressed. Airlines say the most common complaints are a result of the reduction in humidity at high altitudes. or of individuals sitting in close proximity to one another. Airlines even say the air on a plane is better than the air in the terminal. But the airplane cabin is a unique. highly stressful environment. Its low in humidity. pressurized up to a cabin altitude of 8.000 feet above sea level and subject to continuous noise. vibration and accelerations in multiple directions. Air in the airplane cabin is not comparable with air in the airport terminal. Its apples and oranges. The American Society of Heating. Refrigerating and AirConditioning Engineersor ASHRAErecently released standards it found suitable for human comfort in a residential or office building. ASHRAE determined that environmental parameters such as air temperature and relative humidityand nonenvironmental parameters such as clothing insulation and metabolismall factored in to create a comfortable environment. Airlines immediately chimed in. saying average cabin temperatures and air factors fell within the ASHRAE guidelines for comfort. But once again. the air in an airplane cabin is not comparable to air in an office building. The volume. air distribution system. air density. relative humidity. occupant density. and unique installations such as lavatories. galleys all make for a unique condition. The ASHRAE guidelines simply do not translate to the airplane cabin. It is high time we make a concerted effort to study the air quality on our commercial flights and make some changes. Studies done by the airlines are simply not thorough enough. My amendment directs the Secretary of Transportationin conjunction with the National Academy of Sciences--to conduct a study of the air on our flights. After completion of the 1year study. the results will be reported to Congress. It is my sincere hope this will be a step toward more comfortable travel conditions for everyone. I thank the Chair.,USA
1,5292,I ask my friend. because she is the expert on this. if she thinks my description is a good description of why they seem to need so much more land for their waste. From the cyanide leach mine pits. piled hundreds of feet high. over an area of several football fields. is a cyanide solution that is sprinkled over the piles. The cyanide. which is poison. trickles down through the ore. chemically combines with the gold and ore. and collects and pools at the base of the .piles. The gold is stripped from the cyanide solution. but the cyanide solution is left on the site. That is what isso contentious. We have poisoned and dumped on beautiful Federal lands. In this bill. we say: Amen. continue to do it. My friend from Washington is trying to say no to that environmental degradation.,USA
1,29666,Mr. President. I rise today to address the impact the freight rail industry has on reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. According to a recent Department of Transportation study. freight traffic is expected to increase 67 percent by 2020against a backdrop of concerns about global climate change. the stringency of clean air standards. increased traffic congestion. high energy prices. and the need for greater energy independence. Freight rail is the most energy efficient and environmentally friendly mode of land transportation. Today. freight rail can move a ton of freight 436 miles on a single gallon of diesel. U.S. freight railroads have significantly reduced their carbon intensity and fuel efficiency. In 1980. 1 gallon of diesel fuel moved 1 ton of freight by rail an average of 235 miles. In 2007. the same amount of fuel moved 1 ton of freight by rail an average of 436 miles roughly equivalent to the distance from Boston to Baltimore and an 80percent increase over 1980. Depending upon the type of cargo being transported and the number of cars. a single freight train is capable of being as productive as 500 trucks. I am pleased that CSX is working with Ohio. Virginia. North Carolina. West Virginia. and Pennsylvania on the National Gateway. The National Gateway is a plan to create a more efficient rail route linking MidAtlantic ports with midwestern markets. improving the flow of rail traffic between these regions by increasing the use of doublestack trains. This publicprivate partnership will upgrade tracks. equipment and facilities. and provide clearance allowing doublestack intermodal trains. The National Gateway proposes preparing three major rail corridors for doublestack clearance: 195 corridor between North Carolina and Baltimore. MD. via Washington. DC. 170/I76 corridor between Washington. DC. and northwest Ohio via Pittsburgh. PA. and Carolina corridor between Wilmington. NC and Charlotte. NC. The result will be thousands of new jobs. improved railway reliability. and the diversion of heavy trucks from crowded highways leading to reduced emissions and highway maintenance costs and improved road safety. Since the 170/I76 corridor between Washington. DC. and northwest Ohio is a highly traveled route. it is welllocated to become an efficient link between the east coast and midwestern markets. Expansion of rail infrastructure in Columbus. OH. and North Baltimore. OH. will help alleviate some of the freight congestion in the Chicago. Cincinnati and Cleveland areas. The National Gateway project would build a new rail terminal in North Baltimore. OH. and expand intermodal capacity in Columbus. creating thousands of new jobs. I look forward to working with the Virginia. North Carolina. West Virginia. and Pennsylvania delegations to make this partnership a reality.,USA
1,30740,"Every mile of car travel emits 12 times as much pollution as a mile of rail travel. In his discussions with the Mayor of London, will the Minister consider commissioning a survey of the methods of reducing passenger and freight movements into and out of the capital and shifting them to rail? If we shifted the subsidies to non-road transport rather than the motorist, that would massively improve the quality of air in the capital.",UK
1,12637,"The congestion charging zone will give a dispensation to cleaner vehicles, which we greatly welcome. If we get some vehicles off the road to create a flow of traffic, that will reduce congestion. Roads can be congested by people travelling one person to a car, stop-starting, and travelling at low speeds. That is the most polluting aspect of vehicle usage, and we hope that congestion charging can make some contribution to tackling it.",UK
1,4261,"Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that the welcome increases in rail freight can continue only if there is continuing public support for such increases? In constituencies such as mine, densely populated residential areas are being badly affected by vibration and noise from particular flows of freight. That is undermining public support for greater use of rail freight, which is very bad. In October, I raised this subject with the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, the hon. Member for Mansfield (Mr. Meale). Will he undertake to have another look at rail freight going to the Brunner Mond plant in Cheshire?",UK

It is situated at the junction of the A20 and the A2 which leads from the channel ports, and there has been a massive increase in the number of heavy goods vehicles polluting and congesting local roads. It is clear that we must adopt a strategic approach and shift that freight from our roads and onto the rail network.",UK

6,42918,Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the Keystone XL pipeline as well as the underlying bill. The plot here is for jobs. American jobs. Its a nobrainer. Like most Arkansans. I support this projobs project that will strengthen our national security by making us less dependent on Middle Eastern oil. Arkansas families and businesses are hurting due to high gas prices. and the Keystone pipeline will bring an additional 1 million barrels of oil per day into the United States. More supply means lower prices. and Arkansans. as well as all Americans. need relief from these high gas prices. President Obama denied construction of the Keystone XL pipeline despite years of extensive vetting for environmental impacts. Make no mistake. the Presidents decision to reject the Keystone pipeline has cost American jobs. Welspun. a manufacturer in my district. has manufactured nearly half of the pipe for the Keystone pipeline and was forced to lay off 60 workers after the President rejected the pipeline. after he delayed it last year. The Keystone pipeline will strengthen American energy security and create tens of thousands of good American jobs. Its past time to move the Keystone pipeline forward.,USA
6,40747,Madam Speaker. 9.2 percent unemployment in June. Twentynine months in a row of over 8 percent unemployment. Twenty million Americans remain unemployed or underemployed. It has to stop. These are stark reminders that President Obamas excessive spending. unprecedented debt. and overregulation. as well as the threats of jobkilling taxes on small businesses and entrepreneurs. are holding back private sector job creation in our economy. American job creators fear the regulatory and fiscal environment they will face in the near future. Until they have some certainty. they will not invest or hire. We are working hard to bring back that certainty and ensure our progrowth economic environment. By doing that. we must cut red tape. cut spending. and keep taxes low. but also pass legislation to expand domestic energy production and open new markets for American goods overseas. We need President Obama and his party to stop trying to raise taxes on job creators and instead embrace our commonsense proposal to put Americans back to work.,USA
6,45402,"Mr. Speaker. its been almost 5 years since the application to build the Keystone XL pipeline was filed. Its also been almost 5 years that Americans have been waiting for the jobs and energy security Keystone would provide. How much longer will President Obama make us wait? American families expect our government to pursue the least expensive. most reliable domestic energy. Jobless Americans expect that their President wont stand in the way of economic relief. But on both fronts. President Obamas choice to cede to environmental special interests and block the Keystone pipeline in 2011 did the opposite. It denied thousands of jobless Americans the chance at highpaying work and blocked a direct connection between refineries in Texas and affordable energy in Canada. But whats more audacious about the Presidents economically indefensible action is the fact that it is groundless. The Presidents own State Department concluded ""no significant"" environmental damage would be caused by Keystones completion. The Keystone pipeline has jobs to offer. Why is the President turning those jobs away?",USA
6,46603,Mr. Speaker. Republicans have again recklessly threatened Americas future by allowing the Nation. already in a Republican shutdown. to default on its debt unless the Congress votes to stop ObamaCare. The government has been shut down for 2 weeks. and the United States will default on its debt in 2 days. All respected economists say a default means devastating and definitely unnecessary damage to our economy and to the global marketplace. Yet Republicans radically and irresponsibly push us toward the precipice of default. Their disconnect from financial reality is certainly breathtaking. Their actions are reckless. radical. and irresponsible. Mr. Speaker. there is power in numbers. If reasonable Republicans would stand up to their radical right wing. we could end this shutdown and avoid a default today.,USA

6,43535,"The reason increased employment in the public sector destroys jobs in the private sector is that every public sector job has to be paid for by the private sector.

18,50035,"Mr. President. first of all. let me address what happened today because I think it is significant. I think a lot of people are a little bit confused over what did happen. and it was somewhat of a surprise. As the Presiding Officer knows. I have been leading the opposition to this whole idea of cap and trade. It originated way back in 2001. Since that time. we have voted on it many times. I will always remember that back in those days most people believed that manmade gases were contributing to global warming and that the world was going to come to an end because of manmade gases and CO2 emissions. At that time. early on. I was on the Environment and Public Works Committee. I think at that time I was not chairman. but I was the chairman of one of the subcommittees. and I thought. it must be true. everybody says it. Well. some time went by and we got a report. The first one came from the Wharton School where they talked about the fact that if we were to pass cap and tradeat that time there were two bills before the U.S. Senatenot in the House. just in the Senateand those bills would have been capandtrade types of bills. So they calculated what this would cost if we in the United States passed cap and trade. This was way back in 2002. 2003. They said that the range of the cost to the American people would be between $300 billion and $400 billion a year. I do something that I dont think very many people do. but I always do it. Every time I hear a large number. I go back and get the latest figures from my State of Oklahoma as to how many families file a Federal tax return. and then I do the math to determine how much it is going to cost an average family who pays taxes. It came back in excess of $3.000 a year. I thought. that is a lot of money. Lets be sure there is science behind this idea. knowing it all came from the United Nations. That is what started this whole thing. By the way. this IPCC is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. and that is within the United Nations. That is where it all started. If my colleagues remember. that was during the ClintonGore administration. when Al Gore went to South America and came back with this idea of the Kyoto Treaty. We were all going to sign it. and if we didnt. then we were all going to die because of manmade gases. So we started looking at it to see if the science really was there because the only science we had heard about was the IPCC. Well. sure enough. we started getting phone calls from scientists all over the country. This was a long time ago. I started naming the scientists and groups of scientists who were calling in. We got up to 100 and then to 1.000 and then to 4.000. This is all on my Web site even though it was a long time ago. We can see all of these renowned scientists. Richard Lindzen is with MIT. He is one who is considered by a lot of people to be the foremost authority on this. and he is the one who came out adamantly and said: No. the science is not there. It is not settled. So several others started calling in. In fact. I will quote him. if I have it here. what Richard Lindzen actually said at that time. He said: ""Controlling carbon is a bureaucrats dream. If you control carbon. you control life."" That is what bureaucrats would like to do. The Presiding Officer understands that because he has served in the other House and is new here in the Senate. Lindzen also said. talking about Al GoreAl Gore at that time was Vice President of the United States. He was the one who was really pushing this. He said: To treat all change as something to fear is bad enough. To do so in order to exploit that fear is much worse. Of course. what Richard Lindzen of MIT was talking about was the fact that Al Gore at that timethey speculated he would be the first environmental billionaire. That was speculated in the New York Times. Anyway. after that happened. all the other scientists started checking in. These are scientists who cannot be challengedthese individuals. We have hundreds more. and I have a make on each one of these that I would be glad to discuss or debate with anyone. But at the same time. other things were happening. One of the universities here in Virginia commissioned a poll to be done of all of the weathercasters on TV. They came back with 63 percent of the weathercasters saying that any global warming that occurs is a result of natural variation and not human activities. So when I hear peopleI have good friends on the other side that really believe this. and I think that one sometimes has to open it up and realize there is another side to this story. When they say that 97 percent. 98 percent of the scientists agree. it just isnt true. We have the names and things that have actually been said. I think one item that people are going to have to rememberlet me first of all say what happened today because I know they have been told I would explain what happened today. My good friend. Senator WHITEHOUSE. had an amendment. The amendment was one sentence. It says that climate change is real and it is not a hoax. There is a ruling against talking about your own votes on the Senate floor. so I cant do that. But that hoax came from a totally different interpretation. The hoax was the idea that this is happeningclimate change. That it is due to manmade gases. In other words. man is causing it. So what I said on the Senate floor today is: How arrogant is it for people to say that man can do something about changing climate? Climate has always changed. I quoted this morningI said it has changed. Go back and look at the archeological findings. They talk about climate from the beginning of time having changed and changed both ways. The Scriptures talk about it. This is something on which everyone has agreed. and no one would debate that it has always happened. The debate is whether man is causing that to happen. So here we have a chart that showsdo you remember the hockey stick? The hockey stick was the concept that one of the guys with the IPCC came out with and said that it is like a hockey stick. We had this weather going like this for a long period of time. Then all of a sudden it shot up. and it resembled a hockey stick. What they forgot was to put these two things in the hockey stick where it is supposed to be level. One is the medieval warming period that is between 1000 and 1500 A.D. We are talking recently. Then that went into the little ice age. Those were left off the chart. We have looked back. and everything you look at talks about how many years in the past we have had this change that is taking place in climate. I am going to do this from memory. There arein addition to these major changes such as you are seeing on this chart. which is a chart thatthis actually is the IPCCs chart. No one is going to argue with that because they are the ones who dreamed up this whole idea. That is an intergovernmental panel on climate change. But within thatI can remember when I first heard the terms global warming and ice age. it was when they went back and they started tracing not longterm trends in climate change in weather but short term. Starting in 1895. from 1895 to 1918. they had what they referred to as a cooling spell. possibly another little ice age. Then in 1918. it started getting warm again. So from 1918 to 1945 there was a little warming period. That took place kind of every 30 years. Then in 1995. from that period until 1975. for 30 years again. it went into a cooling period. Here is the key. No one will argue with the fact that 1945 was the year that we had the maximum increase surge in C02 emissions. That precipitated not a warming period but a cooling period. Then. of course. 1975 came along. Where are the charts that showed that in 1974Time magazine or one of those? Here it is. This is Time magazine. This is the front. They said: Is another ice age coming? This is 1974. This is making the case. Everybody believed it. They talked about global warming before that and then another ice age. We are all going to die one way or another. Put up the other chart. which is also Time magazine. This is when they said: Oh. no. here is the last polar bear and all the iceso we have another global warming period. Both of them are from Time magazine. Both are 30 years apart. This is what has been happening for a long period of time. Recognizing this. we had a little experience thatgetting back. I made a determination that I would not only support the Whitehouse amendment. since it was just one sentence. it said that climate is changing. and it is not a hoax. but that I could clarify that and maybe become a cosponsor to his amendment. So I did that on the floor just a few minutes ago. I said on the floor that. yes. it is changingno question about that. But the hoax is that there are people who are so arrogant they think they have the power to change climate. That is the hoaxnot the fact that climate is changing. So that is what has been happening. When some of the scientists came out and they started changing back and forth and all of a sudden people realized this whole thing was cooked up by the United NationsIPCC was part of that groupthen they found out that some of the scientists who were behind this were discovering that they had some emails that were sent out saying and proving conclusively that they were cooking the science. that these scientists were lying. One of the things that was discovered and came out was an email from one of the scientists to another. It was 1999 and it read: I have just completed Mikes nature trick. adding in the real temperatures of each of the series for the last 20 years. In other words. they were cooking the science at that time. This thing was such a scandal that throughout the worldwe didnt hear nearly as much in the United States. but we did throughout the world. The UK Telegraph. which is maybe the largest communication in the UK. said that it is the worst scientific scandal of our generation. What they are talking about is the scientific scandal. They are trying to make it sound as if man is responsible for all of these things. The Financial Times came out and said the closedmindedness of these supposed men of science is surprising even to me. The stink of an intellectual corruption is overpowering. One of the IPCC physicists said that climategate was a fraud on a scale I have never seen before. This went on and on. and we could quote Newsweek. the Guardian. and all the rest of them. It was known worldwide as a scandal. What was the scandal? It was that they had a bunch of scientists who were saying we are going to have to pass something like cap and trade because man is causing the world to come to an end. So that is really what that was all about. We are going to have the debate. We want to do that. I chair the Committee on Environment and of Public Works. I chaired it 8 years ago. Then when the Democrats got control of the Senateand now I am back in that position. We will have a chance to have hearings. We are going to have hearings with prominent scientists to come in and talk about this issue because all they say now is: Oh. the science is settled. the science is settled. The science is not settled. That is the reason my good friend Senator WYDEN wants to make some remarks. That is the reason I made that statement today. I think we will have that very healthy debate. But lets keep in mind what the President was suggesting last night. It would cost the American people $479 billion a year. and that would constitute the largest tax increase in the history of America. That is one of his legacies which he is trying during the last part of his presidency and which he announced last night that he is going to put as a top priority. We will be there to be the truth squad in that and make sure that my kids and grandkidsI have 20are not going to be encumbered with the largest tax increase in the world. particularly when their own director said: If you pass it. it will not reduce C02 emissions. I yield floor.",USA
18,36215,"Mr. Speaker. in the aftermath of the Climategate scandal. we now learn that prominent scientists were so determined to advance the idea of humanmade global warming that they worked together to hide contradictory temperature data. blackballed dissenting scientists. and manipulated the peerreview process. The New York Times says that Climategate is no big deal. In a recent article in the Times. an editor. Clark Hoyt. responded to criticism that the newspaper has downplayed the story. Predictably. Hoyt. a ""Warmer"" disagreed. writing that Climategate is not a ""threealarm story."" He defended the Times decision to ignore evidence that doesnt support global warming. He failed to mention that global warming alarmism and fears are largely based on discredited data. The New York Times and the national media should report the news fairly. rather than downplaying stories that dont conform to their media bias agenda. Otherwise. Americans will continue to doubt the medias credibility. And thats just the way it is.",USA
18,36858,"Mr. Speaker. at first. Al Gore claimed to invent the Internet. Now it looks like he really did invent somethingglobal warming. The Nation had one of the coldest winters in years. including record snowfalls in the South. but the Warmers like Al Gore ignore the obvious. and still claim we are all going to perish. saying that Man is the threat to the planet. The groundhog is a better predictor of the weather than Al Gore. Al Gores longwinded article in The New York Times over the weekend was long on claims and short on facts. He didnt cite hard sources for his information. Like the rest of the global warming scientists. they are using fraudulent information. We are supposed to take their word for it now that basic data supporting their claims has. all of a sudden. disappeared. That data has been found to be fraudulent. It is no wonder that data is disappearing. There seems to be no conclusive scientific data that proves the global warming theory. It is a theory. That is what a theory is. something that isnt proven. The Federal Government is trying to force Americans to pay a capandtrade national energy tax. and it is all based on this highly disputed theory of global warming. The United Nations International Panel on Climate Change issued a report in 2007 that made all kinds of claims about global warming. The report is based on some faulty science. Climategate started last year when a whistleblower released emails between all these global warming scientists. The emails and other information released showed these guys had been cooking the books. It is still a huge scandal unfolding on the front pages of newspapers all over the world. especially in England. The Climatic Research Unit at East Anglia University in England is the center of the Climategate scandal. That is where the emails were released by an anonymous whistleblower. Some emails reveal global warming scientists plotting to avoid disclosing information under the Freedom of Information Act in England. and. of course. that is against the law in England. Other email even showed this socalled scientist talking about how to manipulate the data. how to fix the outcome of their scientific experiments. It sounds like fraud to me. Then they spread this false information around to their buddies without a proper peer review. That is how you perpetrate a hoax. The data at the basis of all of these findings are based on the same fraudulent data from one of these small groups of scientists. If global warming is the truth. why are these scientists caught in lie after lie? If it is the truth. why would they be lying to the American people in the first place? The British scientific community spoke out this week about and against their climate science peers. The British Institute of Physics this week said. ""Unless the disclosed emails are proven to be forgeries. worrying implications arise for the integrity of the scientific research and for the credibility of the scientific method."" There is no credible proof man causes weather changes. It is a way to bilk millions of dollars out of taxpayers with a socalled carbon tax. It seems to be all about money. Of course. Mr. Gore is heavily invested in green technology. Last year. he was proclaimed by the media to be the first green technology billionaire. That is a billionaire with a B. Al Gore has made a fortune off of global warming. and so have a lot of other people. He should have to back up his claims with hard data. not the data that has been proved to be false. He would have to prove all of the wild claims. and other scientists should have to prove these claims as well. about man being the culprit of global warming. The fact is that global warming is not a fact. The jury is still out. And thats just the way it is.",USA
18,47944,"Mr. President. all night long? Well. that is going to be fun. By the way. the Oklahoma City Thunders are not playing tonight. so we may get a few more viewers. It is nice to look over and see probably the most articulate and knowledgeable of all of the alarmists historically as our newest Senator from Massachusetts. ED MARKEY. You can be good friends and still disagree. The Senator from Rhode Island certainly knows that because we had a little disagreement last week. The Senator from California certainly knows this as well. We have been working on this for a long time. This started with the Kyoto Treaty. I think most people have forgotten about that. During the ClintonGore administration. Gore came back from Rio de Janeiro and said we are all going to die from global warming. I will say that he knows what he is doing. The New York Times speculated that Al Gore is very likely the first environmental billionaire in existence. so I guess he knows what he is doing there. In spite of the fact of what has happened recently. I think it is probably necessary to have something all night. something to get the attention of the American people. because they keep sayingand I hear it over and overclimate change is real. global warming is real. it is real. it is real. it is real. If you say it enough times. then people are going to think it is real. Tonight. all night long. you can say ""it is real. it is real. it is real."" but I think people have heard that before and times have changed. A couple of things have happened. and I know a lot of you regret this. I remember so well when Lisa Jackson was the Administrator of the EPA. I have often said some very good things about her. even though she is very liberal and I am ranked most of the time as the most conservative Member of the Senate. Yet when she is asked a direct question. she always comes out with an honest answer. I asked my good friend Senator MARKEY just a few minutes ago. who was therefirst of all. let me say the United Nations started all this stuff. They have one big annual party. and it is usually in very nice places. I think at last count 190 countries were there. I remember talking to one of my good friends from one of the subSaharan African countries who was there with his administration. I said: You dont believe this stuff. do you? He said: No. but this is one of the biggest parties of the year. One of the big parties in 2009 was Copenhagen. They set a record of how cold it was in Copenhagen. I remember that very well. I remember at that timeand I hope I get this right because we had several people from the administration. We had at that time Senator John Kerry. of course. Congressman ED MARKEY. NANCY PELOSI. and President Obama. who was Senator Obama at that timeno. he was already President at that time. Their job was to convince the 191 other countries that were in Copenhagen that we in the United States were going to pass some type of real cap and trade legislation. So we had a hearing. At that time I think the Republicans were in control. But I said to Lisa Jackson: I am going to go to Copenhagen tomorrow to be a oneman truth squad. Everybody has been there talking about what we are going to do here in the United States and somebody has to tell them the truth. So I said: I have a feeling when I leave tomorrow. you are going to have a declaration and when you do. it has to be based on some type of science. I could tell by looking at her that they were going to have the endangerment finding. I ask my friend if he remembers that. the endangerment finding. Anyway. I left the next morning for Copenhagen. and that afternoon they had the endangerment finding. Before I left I said: When you have the endangerment finding. it has to be based on some type of science. What science are you going to use? She said: Well. mostly the IPCC. the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. So that is the kind of science they have been using for a long period of time. But. ironically. the timing couldnt be better. It wasnt a matter of weeks after that. it was a matter of hours after that. that climategate was exposed. Climategate was theit all started with East Anglia Universitys Climate Research Unitthe CRUone of the main universities that helps put together the information about global warming for the IPCC. There it was disclosed that the IPCC was systematically distorting the facts. cooking the science of global warming to either cover up data that didnt tell the story they wanted everyone to hear and exaggerating the impacts of changing climate to help drive people out of fear into action. There are three things one needs to know about the IPCC. First of all. the Obama administration has referred to the IPCC as the gold standard of climate change science and global warming. Some say its reports on climate change and global warming represent the socalled consensus of the science opinion about global warming. IPCC and Al Gore were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for their efforts to build and disseminate greater knowledge and doing so through the IPCC. Simply put. what this means is that in the elite circles. the IPCC is a big deal. So as a result of climategatewhen they found they had been lying all this timewhen ABC News. when The Economist. when Time Magazine. when The Times of London. among many others. report that the IPCCs research contains embarrassing flaws and that the IPCC chairman and scientists knew of the flaws but published them anyway. we have the makings of a major scientific scandal. There are two examples of how the IPCC was cooking the science.",USA
18,46515,Of course. The Senator from Texas said if you dont have logic on your side or the facts on your side or the public on your side. what do you do? It is not just pounding the table. It is namecalling. I went through this. I would suggest to my friend. 12 years ago when the Kyoto treaty was up and everyone thought global warming was coming and that was going to be everyones trip to the White House to support global warming. until we realized what the cost would be. I was the bad guy because I stood and said: No. this isnt true. First of all. it is a hoax. and secondly. even if it is not. we couldnt do it. That is when all the namecalling started. I can remember being calledin writing and by a fairly prominent personI should be hanged for treason at that time. That is what they get. and that is what my friend is going through right now with a lot of people who dont agree with him. Twelve years later. what has happened? People realize I was right. I am not suggesting it is going to be 12 years before they realize the Senator from Texas is right on this. but it means the behavior of people today is something that has happened many times in the past. So I would just ask my friend to remember that and to realize that quite often. when a person is right on a controversial issue. they are going to be the subject of a lot of criticism. a lot of cussing. a lot of namecalling. and a lot of violence.

Whereas the Convention. intended to address climate change on a global basis. identifies the former Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern Europe and the Organization For Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). including the United States. as ""Annex I Parties"". and the remaining 129 countries. including China. Mexico. India. Brazil. and South Korea. as ""Developing Country Parties"". Whereas in April 1995. the Conventions ""Conference of the Parties"" adopted the socalled ""Berlin Mandate"". Whereas the ""Berlin Mandate"" calls for the adoption. as soon as December 1997. in Kyoto. Japan. of a protocol or another legal instrument that strengthens commitments to limit greenhouse gas emissions by Annex I Parties for the post2000 period and establishes a negotiation process called the ""Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate"". Whereas the ""Berlin Mandate"" specifically exempts all Developing Country Parties from any new commitments in such negotiation process for the post2000 period. Whereas although the Convention. approved by the United States Senate. called on all signatory parties to adopt policies and programs aimed at limiting their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. in July 1996 the Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs called for the first time for ""legally binding"" emission limitation targets and timetables for Annex I Parties. a position reiterated by the Secretary of State in testimony before the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate on January 8. 1997. Whereas greenhouse gas emissions of Developing Country Parties are rapidly increasing and are expected to surpass emissions of the United States and other OECD countries as early as 2015. Whereas the Department of State has declared that it is critical for the Parties to the Convention to include Developing Country Parties in the next steps for global action and. therefore. has proposed that consideration of additional steps to include limitations on Developing Country Parties greenhouse gas emissions would not begin until after a protocol or other legal instrument is adopted in Kyoto. Japan in December 1997. Whereas the exemption for Developing Country Parties is inconsistent with the need for global action on climate change and is environmentally flawed. and Whereas the Senate strongly believes that the proposals under negotiation. because of the disparity of treatment between Annex I Parties and Developing Countries and the level of required emission reductions. could result in serious harm to the United States economy. including significant job loss. trade disadvantages. increased energy and consumer costs. or any combination thereof: Now. therefore. be it Resolved. That it is the sense of the Senate that(1) the United States should not be a signatory to any protocol to. or other agreement regarding. the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change of 1992. at negotiations in Kyoto in December 1997. or thereafter. which would(A) mandate new commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for the Annex I Parties. unless the protocol or other agreement also mandates new specific scheduled commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for Developing Country Parties within the same compliance period. or (B) would result in serious harm to the economy of the United States. and (2) any such protocol or other agreement which would require the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification should be accompanied by a detailed explanation of any legislation or regulatory actions that may be required to implement the protocol or other agreement and should also be accompanied by an analysis of the detailed financial costs and other impacts on the economy of the United States which would be incurred by the implementation of the protocol or other agreement.

20,863,"Mr. President. I rise today to voice my support for Senate Resolution 98 regarding the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. Like my colleagues in the Senate. -I too am concerned about the effects on the economy of any national or international agreements that the United States enters into. I am particularly concerned with any agreement that may impact the wellbeing of the American public and the ecological balance of this Nation. The U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change has the potential to do both. The United States is scheduled to join with leaders of 160 nations in Kyoto. Japan in December of this year to conclude negotiations on a global climate change treaty. The Kyoto summit is the latest in a series of meetings that have been held since this body ratified the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992. At Kyoto. the United States and other countries hope to adopt a protocol or legal instrument to deal with the threat of climate change in the post 2000 period. It is my belief that the United States must take the leadership role in these negotiations. and steer the course to achieve an equitable. reasoned approach to global climate change mitigation. an approach that seeks inclusion of all countries and that offers a solution to the issue. While I believe the resolution before us will allow such an approach. I want to emphasize to the administration the essential nature of a negotiated framework to which all countries can accede. Before I summarize my analysis of the need for global action. let me review the facts. First. global climate change is real. If it were not. 160 countries would not be meeting to address it. However. there are uncertainties about the effects of global climate changeuncertainties relative to the timing. the magnitude. and regional patterns of climate change. We must acknowledge these uncertainties. but acknowledge also that they do not justify inaction. As stated recently by Dr. William Nordhaus of Yale University: ""The results (of studies) definitely reject inaction. uncertainty alone cannot justify waiting for the revealed truth to act. particularly when the revealed truth. if it ever comes. is probably going to arrive at the point where the effects are irreversible."" Second. a leading indicator of climate change is increased emissions of global greenhouse gases. Concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxidethe largest component of greenhouse gas emissionsare about 26 percent higher now than they were 100 years ago. Also. globally averaged air temperatures at the Earths surface have warmed by nearly 1 degree Fahrenheit over the last 100 years. Increased emissions of greenhouse gases are virtually entirely due to the activities of man. As a general rule. a countrys greenhouse gas emissions rise in concert with increased industrialization. It is no surprise. then. that the United States is the greatest emitter of greenhouse gases. both in terms of gross and per capita emissions. However. the emissions of some developing countries are rapidly escalating. and the emissions of some are expected to surpass that of this country in the first quarter of the next century. Which takes me back- to my call for U.S. leadership. As the worlds industrial leader. the United States should take a clear lead in negotiating a framework for all countries to participate in global climate change abatement. A global approach. and global participation. is requisite to a successful outcome. This approach may require a new framework and a fresh look at timetables and current directions. My understanding of the data is that we have time to do thiswe have time to assess where we are and how best to craft equitable policies. But inaction is not appropriate. The resolution before us requires commitments of developing countries to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in the same timeframes as developed countries. This may -resonate as promoting a policy that discourages the participation of many developing countries. However. the resolution will allow developing countries appropriate flexibilities in commitments to address global climate change abatement. The United States and other developed countries must accord newly developed and developing countries flexibilities and incentives to participate. and these need not create economic disadvantages to the United States or any other developed country. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of this point. Without all countries on board. inaction becomes inevitable. because emission reductions achieved by one country will soon be offset by increased emissions from another. An equitable approach that encourages commitments by all parties and that offers incentives to developing countries is needed. Marketbased solutions to curb emissions will allow continued economic growth with minimal impacts. Developed countries are in a better position to implement emissionscurbing activities and technologies at low cost and impact. and to also transfer these abilities and technologies to developing countries and to aid in their economic advancement in a way that tempers emissions growth. While measures to stabilize greenhouse gases at a certain level will inevitably lead to some energy price increases. an international emissionstrading scheme could substantially reduce the potential costs. What is needed. however. is a policy to ensure that incremental costs of reducing or stabilizing emissions are eqdalized across firms. across sectors. and across countries. This can only occur if we take into account the economies. emissions and abilities of countries to participate. and if we assign actions accordingly and in appropriate timeframes. Market mechanisms can reduce cost impacts of emissions reductions agreements. A preferable policy would be to set short- and longterm goals to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions. and to set quantity limits on emissions that are linked to prices. Targets and timetables for emission limitations cannot operate independently of market prices. An international tradeable emissions permits system. with price caps and floors. would have revenue potential and would be costefficient. Technology transfer and development is an important policy aspect for the abatement of global climate change. The United States and other developing countries have within our current capabilities technologies which can lead to dramatic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. We can increase the efficiencies ot industry. of transportation. of many energyintensive activities. all with what we already know. By implementing these capabilities and by transferring these technologies. to developing countries we can curb emissions significantly. Continued technology development is also necessary. Lastly. -and perhaps most importantly. we must continue to advance the science related to these policies. and to allow policy changes as the data warrant. Mr. President. I conclude my remarks by repeating that I. too. am concerned about any agreements or policies that effect the well being of this country. However. I believe it is in our best interests and that of the world -community to approach global climate change in an inclusive. proactive manner that seeks continued economic growth. That approach demands action. and global coalition building. and it is incumbent upon the United States to steer that course.",USA
20,848,Mr. President. if the Senator will yield. no. that is not my intention. That is not what the resolution says. I have stated previously that under this resolution the developing world must fully participate in the treaty negotiations and commitments and must play a meaningful role in effectively addressing the problem of global climate change. Such participation by the developing country parties could. in my judgment. come in a number of forms. As I stated before the Foreign Relations Committee. while individual countries have different levels of development. the resolution holds that each country must make unique and binding contributions of a pace and kind consistent with their industrialization. The developing world must agree in Kyoto to adopt some manner of binding targets and commitments which would begin during the same compliance period as the-,USA
20,22386,"Mr. President. I want to address a growing misperception concerning the European Unions ability to meet its obligations under the Kyoto Treaty. There are many climate change skeptics who claim that the EU will not be able to meet their greenhouse gas emission reduction targets under the Kyoto Treaty. In turn. they argue that the U.S. should not participate in any ""cap and trade"" system for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Under the Kyoto Treaty. the EU has committed to greenhouse gas reductions target of 8 percent below their 1990 emission levels and covers the years 2008 through 2012. This target is shared by the 15 EU member states. EU15. that existed at the time of the EU ratification of the protocol in May 2001. An additional 10 countries joined the EU in May 2004. eight of which -have individual targets under Kyoto that range from 6 to 8 percent below the 1990 levels. Two of them. Malta and Cyprus. are developing countries and. therefore. do not have any emission targets under the treaty.. In December 2005. the EU. as required by the Kyoto Treaty. reported on the progress made toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The report indicated that EU policies and actions by member states to date have made annual carbon dioxide emissions reduction$ of 5.5 percent in the year 2003 across all 25 of the EU member states. EU25. The report makes the following assessments: For the EU15: Existing measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that are projected to be 1.6 percent below the year 1990 levels in 2010. Savings from additional domestic policies and measures being planned by the EU15 would result in total emission reductions of 6.8 percent. EU15 member states forecast that they will be able to achieve lower emissions of 9.3 percent below the year 1990 levels through the use of the Kyoto flexibility mechanisms inthe year 2010. They include such activities as emissions trading. forest sequestration. and participating in International projects -that result in greenhouse gas reductions through the Joint Implementation and Clean Development Mechanism programs. For the EU25: The total of all member states projections of greenhouse gas emissions will be 5 percent below base year levels in. 2010 as a result .of measures already implemented. The implementation of additional measures is projected to reduce the EU25 greenhouse gas emissions to 9.3 percent below 1990 levels by 2010 and. with the use of Kyoto flexibility mechanisms. to 11.3 percent below the year 1990 levels. The December 2005 report concludes that the EU15 states can meet their target of 8 percent below the 1990 levels if the additional domestic measures and the Kyoto flexibility mechanisms that are planned are implemented. According to the February 14. 2006 statement of the acting head of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Richard Kinley.. 34 industrialized countries under the Kyoto Treaty were ""on their way to lower their emissions levels by at least 3.5% below the 1990 levels during the firstcommitment period."" ""With the help of additional measures and the use of Kyoto marketbased mechanisms. they will as a group be able reach their agreed Kyoto reduction targets."" In June. the European Environment Agency issued the Annual European Community Greenhouse Gas Inventory 19902004 and Inventory Report 2006. The report indicates that the EU15 greenhouse gas emissions for 2004 increased -by 0.3 percent11.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalentsover 2003. However. compared to the base year. emissions in 2004 were 0.9 percent lower. Assuming a linear target path from 1990 to 2010. total EU15 greenhouse gas emissions were 4.7 index points above this target path in 2004. It should be noted that this linear target path is not intended as an approximation of past and future emission trends. It does provide a measure of how close the EU15 emissions are in 2004 to a linear path of emissions from 1990 to the Kyoto target period of 2008-. 2012. assuming that only domestic measures will be used. Therefore. it is not a measure of future compliance .of the EU15 with its greenhouse gas emission targets in 20082012. but aims at evaluating overall EU15 greenhouse emissions in 2004 alone. The EU is fully committed to the Kyoto Treaty. It has adopted a series of policies and measures. such as the EUs greenhouse gas emissions tradingscheme. to meet its target in a costeffective manner. The most recent projections show that these measures. together with the EUs participation in the global carbon market. will allow the EU to meet its target. To ensure its compliance with the Kyoto Protocol. the EU has adopted a series of measures under the European Climate Change Programme. ECCP. Most of these measures have recently entered into force and will start to show their full effect over the next few years. These include: The EU greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme. the promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources. the promotion of cogeneration. CHP. increasing the energy performance of buildings. the promotion of the use of biofuels for transport. the reduction of landfilling of biodegradable waste I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD documents from the European Commission and the European Environmental Agencys reports which summarize the EUs efforts to address climate change. Let me highlight a few of the important elements from these reports for my colleagues.",USA
20,457,Mr. President. press reports today from the annual economic summit of the worlds major industrial powers in Denver indicate that there was pressure on the United States from some of our allies to make new commitments to deep cutbacks on greenhouse gas emissions. specifically. carbon dioxide emissions. It is unfortunate that some of our allies. including the French in particular. chose this forum to change the terms of international dialogue on this issue. I commend President Clinton for resisting these surprising. new pressure tactics to shortcut the progress towards a rea.sonable solution at Kyoto and to try to force the United States to endorse an immediate commitment to unworkable new goals. thereby. shredding the negotiating process. We and the French are both part of negotiations intended as a followup to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. the socalled Rio Pact. signed in 1992. and approved by the Senate. The Rio Pact called upon the industrialized nations to aim to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to their 1990 levels by the year 2000. a goal which will not be achieved by the U.S. or by most of the industrialized nations. As a result of the failure of most of the industrialized world to meet this voluntary commitment to reduce Carbon dioxide emissions. the parties met in Berlin in 1995 to discuss the future direction of the treaty. In Berlin. the United States agreed that new commitments should be binding upon the signatories. but the developing world was excluded from any new commitments. Unfortunately. excluding the developing world. which will be the most important emitter of carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2015. exceeding the emissions of the OECD nations. was a mistake. The solution. if it is to be effective. must include all major emitting nations or it will fail to really get the problem under control. More than that. the perceived unfairness of forcing limits on the economies of only some nations. but not others. will cause political pressure to frustrate the approval and implementation of any treaty that is signed in Kyoto this December. The temptations of industries to flee from the U.S. for example. behind the safe nonbinding walls of Mexico. for instance. or other developing nations. will both frustrate the goals of a treaty and unfairly penalize the developed economies. Therefore. Mr. President. the distinguished Senator from Nebraska. Mr. HAGEL. and I authored a Sense of the Senate Resolution indicating that it is imperative for the developing world to be parties to any binding commitments made in Kyoto. that those socalled commitments should demonstrate unequivocally an action program to approach this problem in a realistic way. and that everyone should start with aggressive efforts to act on those commitments immediately and not settle for vague promises to return to future negotiations to get serious. While some countries have different levels of development. each must make unique and binding contributions of a kind consistent with their industrialization. The developing world must agree in Kyoto to some manner of binding commitments which would begin at the same time as the developed world with as aggressive and effective a schedule as possible given the gravity of the problem and the need for a fair sharing of the burden. Mr. President. in Denver during the last two days. some nations put pressure on the United States to agree to a whole new set of commitments beyond those agreed to in Rio. beyond the target of stabilizing at 1990 levels by the year 2010. Those nations sought to get the U.S. to agree to a 15 percent reduction by 2010. a level of reduction which would have very serious impacts on major sectors of the U.S. economy. There were no discussions of bringing the developing world into the play. I highly commend President Clinton for resisting these surprising new pressures to deviate from the Kyoto track. and set targets for very sharp new levels of reductions. Those nations should know that the United States Senate stands strongly behind the President in resisting these pressures. Reductions must be fair. .wellmanaged. wellplanned. and spread across the globespread across the globe. In addition. Mr. President. a wideranging new set of initiatives is needed to harness technology. to engage in new crash research and development technologies to mitigate the carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion. as .well as new energy efficiency programs. and cooperative programs between the developed and developing world. We have only begun to match the targets of carbon dioxide reductions and limitations with our technological genius and to engage in pioneering a new energy frontier type program aimed at using mans genius to tackle this global problem from every conceivable angle. I reiterate. Mr. President. that President Clinton is to be commended for resisting the pressure for these sudden draconian commitments. Mr. President. i yield the floor.,USA

On the question of carbon dioxide, will she say what she is doing, with the DTI, to press for more investment in clean coal technology? If we are to tackle CO 2 emissions, especially in China and India, we need to be able to transfer new clean coal technology to those countries so that we can effect a reduction in CO 2 emissions.",UK

If we are to have sustained economic growth, as we both want, and if we are serious, which I am and which I suppose he isâ€”certainly the Secretary of State isâ€”about trying to achieve carbon reduction we must find a means of allying it to economic growth, not explaining away carbon increases in terms of economic growth.",UK
