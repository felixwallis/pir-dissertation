With these investments we will change the way our country generates. uses and delivers energy. We will produce jobs throughout the United States and begin to end our dependence on foreign oil.

1110049036,Madam Speaker. global warming is no longer an academic question for scientists to ponder. Its a very real crisis that requires our leadership. This is not a political issue. This is a critical generational -responsibility that will take a commitment from Congress and from every person in our society. We have a real opportunity this year to prove our commitment by voting for H.R. 2454. the American Energy and Security Act. The renewable technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions exist. The societal will and desire to go clean have been demonstrated. and the political climate to finally create sound public policy is now present. The cost of inac-. tion on this critical challenge is unacceptable and the price too high. A recent study concluded that unchecked effects of climate change could result in a cost of $271 billion per year by 2025. Failure to act is intolerable when considering the .economic and job creation opportunities a clean energy economy presents.

1100151640,"Madam. Speaker. on the occasion of National Public Health Week. I rise today to focus attention on the effects of climate change on the health of the nations most vulnerable citizens. Scientists from around the worid have issued clear warnings that the Earths temperature is rising as a result of the release of harmful greenhouse gases into the atmosphere by human activity. Climate change negatively affects the environment in a fundamental way. It affects the air we breathe. the water we drink. the food we eat. and it contributes to the spread of disease. Extreme weather events such as heat waves. drought. and stronger hurricanes further illustrate the dangers associated with climate change. Climate change looms large for everyone in our Nation. but it disproportionately impacts our Nations vulnerable populationschildren. the elderly. the poor. and people diagnosed with chronic illness. These populations are not only most vulnerable to adverse health conditions as a result of climate change. they also lack the resources to mitigate the impact of these conditions on their daily lives. We must act now to prevent dangerous. irreversible warming of our planet and to ensure a promising future for other generations. That is why I have joined as a cosponsor of H. Res. 1081. recognizirig the week of April 7. 2008 to April 13. 2008. as ""National Public Health Week"" and designating the theme of the week as ""Climate Change: Our Health in the Balance.""

1100162940,Mr. Speaker. our Nations industrial revolution was powered by coal. and with the current state of our energy market. coal should receive the attention it deserves. It is an important energy source for our country. Coal is the United States most abundant and efficient fuel source. and we hold over onequarter of the worlds coal reserves. The energy content of the Nations coal reserves exceeds that of all the worlds known oil reserves. In my home State of Ohio. we have reserves that will last for 250 years. Coal provides more than half the electricity consumed by Americans. And work is currently being done in my district to develop coal gasification. which is a process that increases the efficiency of coal within a closed system. The current Democratic leadership in Congress refuses to invest money into the coal gasification process. while China at the same time is investing $24 billion into the sam6 technology. We must embrace all forms of energy to keep our economy and products competitive with the rest of the world.,110120170.0,LATTA,ROBERT,H,OH,M,R,5.0,voting,H,2008-05-14,339,Mr. LATTA,Unknown,LATTA,Unknown,M,22842,22871,05142008.txt,1031,174,110,2008,nation industri revolut coal current energi market coal attent deserv import energi sourc coal effici fuel sourc onequart world coal reserv energi nation coal reserv exce world known reserv home reserv last coal provid half electr consum work current done develop coal gasif increas effici coal close current refus invest money coal gasif china invest billion sam technolog energi economi product competit rest world,93,0.3880597014925373,0.3170731707317073
1110048469,I want to thank the gentleman and also Representative LARSEN for allowing me to work with them on this to help ensure that our American innovators intellectual [SE H6489 property is protected as we move forward in this international community transition to green economics. American innovators hold 50 percent of the worlds patents granted between 2002 and 2008 in the cleanenergy field. and I will note that Tennesseans alone hold 1 percent of those worldwide patents in the hybrid/ electric vehicle market. Its serious. business for our American patent holders. They have invested a lot of time. passion. effort. energy. and economic capital in developing these technologies. It is therefore incumbent upon us in Congress to protect what they have created. The draft U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. for example. includes language supported by extreme carbonemitting nations like India and China calling for a multilateral technology climate fund housed inside the U.N. This new fund would require noncommercial transfers of patentprotected technologies as a price for developing nations participation in any new international agreement to reducing global emissions. These demands would lead to outright theft of our American intellectual property and indirectly benefit the worlds most prominent C02 emitters. Our amendment. which is supported by the U.S. Chamber of Cordmerce and the Emergency Committee for American Trade. would protect American intellectual property rights and help block any patent transfer to a new multilateral fund. In the context of any international framework that deals with energy and environment technology. the amendment declares that it is official American policy to defend the rights of our creators.,111118630.0,BLACKBURN,MARSHA,H,TN,F,R,7.0,voting,H,2009-06-10,522,Mrs. BLACKBURN,Unknown,BLACKBURN,Unknown,F,41587,41638,06102009.txt,1748,265,111,2009,want also repres larsen allow work help ensur intellectu se move intern commun transit green econom percent world cleanenergi field note tennessean alon percent worldwid hybrid electr vehicl market seriou holder invest passion effort energi econom capit develop technolog incumb us un framework convent climat exampl includ languag extrem carbonemit nation like india china call multilater technolog climat fund insid un new fund noncommerci patentprotect technolog price develop nation particip new intern global emiss lead outright theft intellectu indirectli benefit world promin c emitt us cordmerc emerg trade intellectu help new multilater fund context intern framework deal energi environ technolog polici creator,159,0.3130434782608696,0.31645569620253167

1110072037,Mr. Speaker. the scientific consensus about whether humans are causing global warming is clear. Reports from the United Nations IPCC underscore the need for all countries to take action to reduce global warming pollution. As I speak. world leaders are meeting in Copenhagen to negotiate a new global climate treaty. This is a tremendous opportunity for the United States to lead the world in coalescing around a fair. ambitious. and binding climate agreement. We must confront the causes of global warming and manage the impacts of climate change. such as rising sea levels. and help developing countries benefit from clean energy technologies. Mr. Speaker. the United States has a lot to gain in Copenhagen. Currently. European countries generate more of their electricity than we do from clean alternative sources. while China is on track to become the worlds leading maker of wind turbines by the end of this year. The United States can lead the world in growing a clean energy economy. We can create new American jobs and strengthen our national security while we protect our planet.

In fact. if Texas were its own separate country. it would rank seventh in the world in carbon dioxide emissions. Unless Texas significantly alters its fuel mix towards lower emitting fuels or renewable energy. greenhouse gas emissions are expected to continue to rise rapidly. I am unhappy that the overall energy use in Texas is projected to increase by 36 percent over the next 20 years. We must act now to stop this trend. This pattern is bad for our environment.

We must address our energy problems as we continue to address our economic problems. By doing so. I believe we can ensure that while our economy recovers. we will be competitive and secure in the energy sector as well. The passage of H.R. 3246 is indeed vital to addressing both of these concerns. As Congress moves through this session. we must continue to pass policies that will promote energy efficiencypolicies which drill and mine efficiencies as we previously drilled for oil and mined for coal. Finally. we must continue to invest in research and development to ensure that our United States are at the forefront of the energy revolution: Creating jobs. embracing intellectual capacity. and promoting clean domestic energy.

1110062032,Mr. President. I want to bring to the attention of the distinguished chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior. Environment and Related Agencies a very important program in my State. The Environmental Protection Agencys National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor. MI. leads EPAs Clean Automotive Technology Program by facilitating collaboration with the automotive industry through innovative research to achieve ultra lowpollution emissions. increase fuel efficiency and reduce greenhouse gases. One of the programs that has been developed collaboratively through the Ann Arbor laboratory and its industry partners is the hydraulic hybrid technology which has come out of the laboratorys focus areas in hydraulic hybrid research. engine research. alternative fuels research and technical and analytical support. This technology offers potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent. The Presidents fiscal year 2010 budget increases the Climate Protection Program line in EPAs budget. which includes this facility. and I appreciate the subcommittees concurrence with the request in the bill before the Senate. It is my understanding that the version of the bill adopted by the House of Representatives provides an additional $1.6 million over the fiscal year 2010 budget request.

It defies common sense when the American people are faced with losing jobs and families are making hard decisions about how to weather this tough economy. The Democrats priority is to impose a new tax. This capandtax proposal will lead to job losses. higher gas prices. and increased electricity rates on American families with $3.128 of new taxes for each family each year. Moreover. it is also unnecessary when there are positive alternatives to promote clean energy technology. An alloftheabove energy policy would achieve the goals of a cleaner environment while promoting oil and natural gas exploration in America. invest in innovative new technologies and encouraging conservation and smarter energy use.

It is wise to conserve. and we need to promote conservation. It is wise to advance energy efficiency technologies. We need to invest. But new capacity. new energy sources are also sorely lacking. We need new national gas supplies in this country. We need refinery capacity. We need our own oil. albeit limited. But weve got to. number one. grow our capability to create energy in our country to be energy independent. I want to talk about nuclear energy because the cars of the future are going to run off of lithium batteries. some form of electric. Weve got to have new capacity. We need nuclear energy in this country to be selfsufficient even on transportation. If were going to reduce our carbon footprint. dont leave nuclear off the table.

1110017673,"Madam Speaker. today I am introducing the ""Solid Waste Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act."" legislation that will reduce our nations contribution to global warming by addressing the methane gas that escapes from municipal solid waste landfills. Hardly a week goes by without reports of new evidence that the world climate is changing because of human activities that are putting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Scientists predict that as the earth warms. droughts and flooding will become more severe. threatening the worlds food supply. Warmer ocean waters are producing expanding oxygendepleted zones that are unable to support sea life. Higher temperatures are shrinking the Arctic ice cap. threatening coastal communities with rising sea levels and destroying the habitat that polar bears depend E547 on for survival. It is imperative that we look at all the options available to us for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. While -most of us are familiar with the harmful effects of C02. methane is a greenhouse gas that is even more harmful. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reports that methane is over 20 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere than C02. Decomposing waste in landfills is the largest source of U.S. anthropogenic methane emissions. accounting for approximately 24 percent of these emissions. About 138 million tons of municipal solid waste were discarded into 1.754 landfills in 2006. according to EPA estimates. Municipal and other landfills emitted over 6 million metric tons of methane gas into the atmosphere in 2005. the equivalent of 132 million tons of C02. The Solid Waste Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act will create a new national program to address these emissions. By requiring the owner or operator of a. municipal solid waste landfill to collect a modest fee on each ton of waste disposed of. revenue will be made available to support programs to reduce the amount of waste entering landfills and to make beneficial use of the methane generated by decomposing landfill waste.A fee of $5.00 per ton will produce close to $700 million in revenue for this program. The fees will be remitted to the local government having jurisdiction over the area in which the landfill is located. The local government could use the fees itself to undertake greenhouse gas reduction projects that were determined by EPA to be costeffective. Alternatively. the local government could provide grants. loans. or other financial assistance to other entities to undertake such projects. or could transfer the fees to the State for that purpose. Projects could include waste reduction measures or recycling programs to reduce the amount of methane generated by decomposition. landfill gas recovery. and waste recovery including energy generation. Americans understand the enormous challenge we face as a nation in preventing global warming and are asking how they can make a difference. With the funding provided by this legislation. local communities can identify and implement projects that will make a real contribution to reducing greenhouse gases. I urge my colleagues to support the ""Solid Waste Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act.""",,,,,,,,,,E,2009-03-04,494,Mr. MORAN of Virginia,Unknown,MORAN,Virginia,M,30413,30499,03042009.txt,3169,498,111,2009,introduc solid greenhous nation contribut global warm methan escap municip solid landfil hardli without report new evid world climat human greenhous gase atmospher scientist predict earth warm drought flood becom threaten world food suppli warmer ocean water produc expand oxygendeplet zone sea life higher temperatur shrink arctic ice cap threaten coastal commun rise sea level destroy habitat polar bear depend surviv imper look avail us emiss greenhous gase us familiar harm effect c methan greenhous even harm us environment report methan effect trap heat atmospher c decompos landfil largest sourc us anthropogen methan emiss approxim percent emiss million ton municip solid discard landfil epa estim municip landfil emit million metric ton methan atmospher equival million ton c solid greenhous new nation program emiss owner municip solid landfil collect modest fee ton dispos avail program amount enter landfil make benefici methan gener decompos landfil wastea fee per ton produc close million program fee remit local area landfil locat local could fee undertak greenhous project determin epa costeffect local could provid loan financi assist entiti undertak project could fee purpos project could includ measur recycl program amount methan gener decomposit landfil recoveri recoveri includ energi gener understand enorm challeng face nation global warm make fund provid local commun identifi implement project make real contribut greenhous gase solid greenhous,294,0.25595238095238093,0.296

I would like to discuss an article in todays New York Times confirming that renewable energy industriesespecially wind and solarhave been slowed significantly by the credit crisis and the broader economic downturn. I believe that we should not allow frozen credit markets to derail renewableenergy projects. and we cannot allow reduced oil prices to lull us into complacency. We have an opportunity to address both of these concerns by working with the Senate. and with the Obama Administration. to pass the economic recovery package into law. I believe that the recovery package must extend tax credits for biofuels. wind. and solar. It must make infrastructure investments. It mbst increase federal dollars for energy research. development. and deployment. And it must encourage the production of alternative -fuel motor vehicles. including plugin electric drive vehicles.

CARICOM Member States are being forced to divert resources from important development initiatives such as health. food. education and critical infrastructure issues to adapt to the damages being caused by the climate change. Some of the major effects being experienced include sealevel rise. increasingly severe hurricanes. drought and water scarcity. coral bleaching and declining fish stocks. CARICOM is asking developed countries to take immediate action to help counteract the effects of climate change and to increase funding over and above traditional official development assistance. The United Nations has been requested to assist specifically with disaster preparedness. I encourage the International Community to mobilize to help the Caribbean protect its precious beautiful environment as a legacy for all mankind.",,,,,,,,,,E,2008-04-09,787,Mr. RANGEL,Unknown,RANGEL,Unknown,M,45514,45551,04092008.txt,1423,213,110,2008,come recogn effect climat caribbean commun want enter new caribnew march march respect pay price climat deal climat caribbean commun caricom small island develop sid least develop lcd experienc seriou effect climat even though contribut least problem least capac new condit caricom forc divert import develop health food infrastructur issu damag caus climat effect experienc includ sealevel rise increasingli hurrican drought water scarciti coral bleach fish stock caricom develop take help counteract effect climat increas fund tradit develop assist nation assist disast prepared encourag intern commun mobil help caribbean preciou beauti environ legaci mankind,130,0.28125,0.2898550724637681
1110053481,Madam Speaker. we all want to protect our planet. but will the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 do that? I dont think so. The pollution targets are inadequate. Regulatory- authority is stripped from the EPA. The bill relies on huge numbers of carbon offsets. For example. it says you can have 2 billion tons a year of carbon offsets. which is roughly equivalent to 30 percent of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Recent analysis suggests it might be 2026 until we see the emissions decline below 2005 levels. The renewable targets are not strong enough. A recent analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists indicates this. target provides no new renewable energy over business as usual projections. Dirtyenergy options qualify as renewable. including biomass burners and trash incinerators. The bill gives a significant number of pollution permits away free. It opens up a carbon derivatives market in the U.S.. and this bill would help establish one of the largest derivative markets in the world without adequate oversight or regulation. It taxes households to pay for an unproven carbon sequestration of capture and storage technology. and allocations for funding. for international obligations are underfunded. We can do better.,111116900.0,KUCINICH,DENNIS,H,OH,M,D,10.0,voting,H,2009-06-23,329,Mr. KUCINICH,Unknown,KUCINICH,Unknown,M,22325,22361,06232009.txt,1249,200,111,2009,want planet clean energi dont pollut target inadequ regulatori author strip epa reli huge carbon offset exampl billion ton carbon offset roughli equival percent us greenhous emiss analysi suggest might see emiss level renew target strong enough analysi union concern scientist indic target provid new renew energi usual project dirtyenergi renew includ biomass burner trash inciner give signific pollut away free open carbon market us help establish largest market world without oversight household pay unproven carbon sequestr captur storag technolog fund intern underfund better,115,0.2708333333333333,0.2857142857142857

1100183218,Madam Speaker. today I am introducing the Trade and Environment Enforcement Act. also known as the Green 301 Act. This bill expands the Section 301 provisions of the Trade Act of 1974 to encompass environmental effects. Under the Trade and Environment Enforcement Act. the Trade Representative must identify those foreign country trade practices causing negative environmental impacts to human. animal. or plant life or health. or the conservation of exhaustible natural resources in the United States. the foreign country. a third country. or internationally. Once those practices have been identified. the Trade Representative must issue a report to Ways and Means and to Senate Finance with its findings. After the Trade Representative issues its report. it must engage in consultations with foreign governments to resolve the negative practices it identifies with in the report and seek to negotiate an agreement between the United States and the foreign country providing for the mitigation. reduction. or elimination of the identified negative environmental impacts. If no agreement is reached. then the trade representative is authorized to take all appropriate and feasible action authorized under Section 301. Additionally. the Trade and Environment Enforcement Act permits petitions and consultations under this process from interested parties. including environmental organizations and the business community. to expand the types and scope of the Trade Representatives environmental review.,,,,,,,,,,E,2008-07-10,664,Mr. BLUMENAUER,Unknown,BLUMENAUER,Unknown,M,38569,38606,07102008.txt,1501,219,110,2008,introduc trade environ enforc also known green expand provis trade encompass environment effect trade environ enforc trade repres identifi foreign trade caus neg environment impact human anim plant life health conserv exhaust natur foreign intern identifi trade repres issu report way mean financ find trade repres issu report engag consult foreign resolv neg identifi report seek negoti foreign provid mitig identifi neg environment impact reach trade repres author take feasibl author trade environ enforc consult interest parti includ environment commun expand scope trade repres environment,128,0.36363636363636365,0.2857142857142857

I think that is a .very important point to make. that this 1s.100 percent American 6hergy. but. also in terms of what happens with the net economic impact. There are some who claim that. well. we should deal with the fossil fuels. the oil and coal. because they createjobs. Well. they do create jobs. but I think the evidence is clear that the investment in the alternative energies of the future that youre talking about. in wind and solar. the clean energy economy creates about four times the jobs for each million dollars invested as in the traditional fossil fuels. And when you consider that we are also avoiding some of the most negative consequences of burning dirty coal on the health of individuals and of the larger ecosystem. it is a multiple benefit to the economy and the environment. You know. on the floor. and this was incredible to me. last week I heard my Republican friends being upset that the Speaker. with the initiative to green the Capitol. had replaced dirty coal with natural gas. which has half the carbon emissions. It doesnt have the other problems in terms of sulfur dioxide. in terms of carbon monoxide. fl 2045 The Capitol Heating Plant was the number one source of pollution in our Nations Capital. threatening the lives and health of people who work around the capitol.

1100153416,Madam Chairman. I rise in support of the amendment offered by my colleague from Washington to the Beach Protection Act. For the last 20 years. my colleagues in the scientific community have issued warnings that the release of greenhouse gases is altering the Earths climate in ways that are both expensive and deadly. And nowhere is this change more evident than- in the changing habitat of our worlds oceans. Science has demonstrated that global change is already causing the sea level to rise. It is predicted that in my home State of New Jersey. the sea level rise will cause a loss of 7 inches to 2 feet of our coastline by the end of the decade. Of course. changes in the acidity of the ocean from increased carbon is another effect. And as the oceans continue to change. factors that are known to affect water quality along our coastline. such as flooding. storms and erosion. will. of course. occur. The Inslee amendment simply requires the Environmental Protection Agency to study the effects of the global climate change on our Nations coastlines. The amendment will help States. local communities and Congress better address the challenges. prepare for the changes. and it will call attention to the steps we need to take to prevent further damage. So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I commend my colleague for preparing and introducing this amendment.

1110060856,Mr. Speaker. today I offer my strong support for the Coral Reef Conservation Act Reauthorization and Enhancement Amendments. Coral reefs are unique ecosystems that support over one million species globally. offer essential protection from hurricanes. typhoons. and tsunamis. and attract millions of vacationers each year. Unfortunately. these reefs face unparalleled dangers today from pollution. overfishing. coastal development. disease. habitat fragmentation. ship groundings. and warming waters. Ten percent of coral reefs have already disappeared from U.S. waters alone while over seventy percent of the worlds reefs are threatened. If this trend continues. more than forty percent of global coral reefs will be lost in the next two to ten years. The Coral Reef Conservation Act Reauthorization addresses the coral reef crisis by taking strong actions in response to physical damages to reefs by developing scientific management strategies to promote reef resilience.

There has been a lot of talk and controversy on the floor about bonuses for Americas executives. Let me tell you who I believe really deserve bonuses.

Its the people on Long Island who are working on LED lighting and biofuels. the people at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden. Colorado. who are working on battery storage. the people at General Motors who are working on plugin hybrids. the people at Brookhaven National Labs who are working on nanotech. the venture capitalists and the investors and the engineers and the researchers and the developers who are bringing new technologies to market which will reduce our dependence on foreign oil once and for all. which will create a new generation of jobs. which will expand our economy. and which will reduce energy costs.

1110056236,Madam Speaker. I stand for the creation of new American jobs. for less dependence on foreign energy. and for a reduction in the carbon pollution that -causes global warming. This bill is about national security. creating jobs in a new energy economy. and defending consumers through a fiscally responsible bill with consumer protections. These investments will also spur new jobs. The Political Economy Research Institute estimates that 3.5 jobs will be created in the new green job sector for every. 1 job that is fossil fuel source based in Florida. This could mean over 94.000 jobs in Florida alone. Too often our foreign policy decisions are affected by the regional stability of oil producing countries. In Iraq we are paying for our oilcentric obsession and Floridians have paid over $37 billion for the war there. This legislation offers incentives that promote energy efficiency and that will break our addiction to foreign oil. We must be focused on research and development for .green technologies and end the obsession with crude oil that is fueling too much of our economy. The bill is not perfectfew -landmark bills are. Once the Senate takes up the bill later this year. this bill will be further improved and will address the shortcomings that exist in this version. My mission will be to ensure that the final legislation that is passed will include the necessary consumer protections to minimize price increases. We cannot waitto act on climate change legislation. Florida is already experiencing eroding shorelines. flooding and dying coral reefs. In particular. the Everglades face severely altered water flows and harmful invasive species. This will also have a devastating impact on Floridas economy. In 2007. tourists flocking to Floridas beaches and other priceless environmental areas spent over $65 billion in Florida. Without aggressively capping carbon emissions. the earths temperature will continue to rse. causing more extreme storms and altered ocean conditions which will have a devastating effect on Floridas ecosystem. The American Clean Energy and Security -Act (ACES) works to minimize price increases for consumers. On average the EPA estimates that this bill will cost an average household $98 to $140 per year in price increases. while holding those.in the lowest income quintile harmless. Without carbon emissions caps. we have seen energy prices fluctuate drastically. By regulating carbon intensive goods and creating a transparent market this bill will help to stabilize those prices and help protect consumers. By investing in conservation. efficiency and renewables. Florida residents will see lower costs in energy though building weatherization improvement benefits. and energy efficiency savings.,111115830.0,MEEK,KENDRICK,H,FL,M,D,17.0,voting,H,2009-06-26,602,Mr. MEEK of Florida,Unknown,MEEK,Florida,M,58205,58271,06262009.txt,2744,425,111,2009,stand new job depend foreign energi carbon pollut caus global warm nation job new energi economi consum fiscal respons consum invest also spur new job polit economi research institut estim job new green job sector job fossil fuel sourc florida could mean job florida alon foreign polici decis affect region stabil produc iraq pay oilcentr obsess floridian billion war incent promot energi effici break addict foreign focus research develop green technolog obsess crude fuel economi perfectfew landmark take later improv shortcom exist mission ensur final includ necessari consum minim price increas waitto climat florida alreadi experienc erod shorelin flood die coral reef particular everglad face water flow harm invas speci also devast impact florida economi tourist flock florida beach priceless environment area billion florida without aggress cap carbon emiss earth temperatur continu rse caus extrem storm ocean condit devast effect florida ecosystem clean energi ace work minim price increas consum averag epa estim averag household per price increas thosein lowest incom quintil harmless without carbon emiss cap seen energi price fluctuat drastic carbon intens good transpar market help stabil price help consum invest conserv effici renew florida resid see lower energi though build weather improv benefit energi effici,255,0.20689655172413793,0.2826086956521739

The West. of coarse. is having an unprecedented drought. and this will help not only to bring up those shovelready projects that will bring 500.000 acrefeet of water and thousands of jobs for the reclaimed reuse water and added storage capacity. but this will lessen a lot of the areas reliance on costly water and unreliable sources.

The future of the American auto industry and thousands of American jobs rest on the ability of domestic car companies to research. develop. and commercialize new. clean. efficient technologies. including hydrogen and fuel cell technologies. that will be the backbone of a new U.S. vehicle market and economy. Hydrogen fuel cells can provide power for a wide array of transportation applications. Fuel Cells are a proven technology and already in use today. In Hartford.

Every time we replace a gasoline powered bus with a fuel cell bus it is equal to removing 77 cars from our roadways. The hydrogen and fuel cell industry already supports 2.100 jobs in Connecticut alone and with this bill is poised to add many others.

NASA has been compiling temperatures from the last 130 years. and I will be more than willing to give it to you. I guess the fundamental question is. as China and India industrialize. as other parts of the world industrialize and start to send up more fossil fuels into the atmosphere. do we believe this trend is likely to stop and abate. or is it likely to exacerbate and continue to skyrocket? I think the evidence. since the beginning of the industrialized period as we have moved from 280 parts per million to 380 parts per million of C02 in our atmosphere. is that the more we add the warmer it gets. And as the 3 or 4 billion people in this developing world begin to want to drive automobiles and have electricity in their homes. its pretty clear that the trend line is heading upwards.

1110038597,Madam Speaker. in 1994. the EPA enacted a regulation requiring additives derived from renewable sources for our. Nations fuel supplies. This policy caused problems as corn ethanol pushed up food prices and turned out to be far less beneficial for the environment than originally thought. with some studies even concluding ethanol may be worse for the environment than gasoline. Now. over a decade later. the EPA has ruled that Congress tasked it with regulating greenhouse gases when it passed the Clean Air Act. Without action by Congre.ss. regulations are soon to follow. This fact is being held over our heads by some who claim it is better to let Congress regulate emissions than unelected bureaucrats. This is a false choice. The act was never intended to regulate carbon. and we can pass legislation to make that clear.

1110056253,"Madam -Speaker. I rise today in support of the American Clean Energy and Security Act (ACES). This historic initiative will create jobs in new renewable energy industries and energy efficiency. reduce American dependence on imported oil. and decrease the greenhouse gas emissions that are causing global climate change. The growth of these new industries will enhance the ability of the United States to produce its own energy and reduce the need for oil imports from foreign countries.- We currently import nearly 60 percent of our energy needs from abroad. This imbalance makes our country dependent upon foreign countries for the fuel that keeps our economy running. It is estimated that ACES will reduce U.S. oil consumption by 2 million barrels per day by 2030. Growing our domestic clean energy industry and reducing our use of foreign oil will have an important tangible benefitreducing the greenhouse gas emissions that are causing global climate change. The NobelPrize winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has determined that significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. like carbon dioxide. are necessary to mitigate significant environmental .consequences. ACES meets this challenge by creating a framework to reduce U.S. emissions 83 percent below 2005 levels by 2050. ACES accomplishes these goals while limiting costs to businesses and the consumer. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has determined that implementing this bill would cost the average household about 48cents per day.. ACES also includes assistance for energyintensive manufacturing industries like steel. cement. and glass to ensure that these industries remain economically competitive in the global marketplace as we strengthen our environmental laws and transitioned to clean energy and greater energy efficiency. I am proud that this bill includes a provision I spearheaded -that will require the Environmental Protection Agency Administrator to create a national strategy to reduce carbon emissions through biologic sequestration. Carbon dioxide can be absorbed from the atmosphere into plants. trees. and other vegetation through the natural process of photosynthesis. My provision would ensure that we utilize natural landscape and green infrastructure to maximize our ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere through a determined strategy for reforestation. improved agricultural practices. and urban greening. This important legislation defines new energy goals for our nation and enables us to lead the world towards a clean energy future. For businesses and families back home it identifies a way forward to not only reduce harmful carbon emissions but to create new economic opportunities. new ""green"" jobs. conservation and energy- efficiency. and alternative. cleaner sources of energy. Together these actions will better ensure our nations security. economy. and health.

Concerning this High Energy Cost Grant Program. it says: The administration proposes to eliminate the High Energy Cost Grant Program because it is duplicative of and less effective than the Rural Utility Services Electric Loan Program. This recommendation by the administration to eliminate this program is because it is both duplicative and unnecessary and there is a $6.6 billion program in electric loans at no cost to the taxpayer.

President Obama and this Congress are taking on our Nations energy crisis with a plan to create green jobs and build a clean energy economy. a plan that creates 300.000 new jobs by implementing a Renewable Electricity Standard. and another 222.000 new jobs with its high efficiency savings provisions. Mr. Speaker. we have a choice to make in this Congress. we can choose to create millions of new American jobs that cannot be shipped overseas. reduce our dependence on oil from overseas. increase production of cleaner renewable energy sources. crack down on polluters who damage our air and our water quality. and give American entrepreneurs and innovators the tools they need to stay combative in the global economy. or we can do something else.

Over two Congresses. our committee has heard from over 300 expert witnesses who have made it clear that we need swift action to rebuild our economy and address climate change. America is ready. and the world is watching. We must transition to a clean energy economy so that we can create jobs here In America. achieve energy independence. and protect our planet for future generations. We have before us a powerful. thorough and effective bill. It includes a nationwide renewable electricity standard to ensure consumers get more of their electricity from wind. solar and biomass energy. It contains critical investments in energy efficiency. and it requires immediate significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that are harming our planet. We must enact comprehensive climate legislation. and we must enact it now. We cant sit idly by and allow other nations to lead the way to a clean energy future. Ithink America can and must do better.

1110064025,Mr. Chairman. green energy presents a world of opportunity for our economy. In terms of job creation. it has already generated millions of highwage positions for workers in fields ranging from engineering and IT to agriculture and construction. Small firms make up the lions share of this growing sector. and they will play a key role in our Nations efforts to reduce carbon emissions and break free from foreign oil. But they cannot do it without the capital to continue research and production. H.R. 3854 delivers critical capital to the small businesses driving the clean energy sector. Mr. SCHOCKs amendment enhances those efforts by adding an important element of transparency. By requiring SBA to release quarterly reports on the Renewable Energy Capital Investment Program. we can gauge the agencys progress in expanding the initiative. We can also pinpoint areas that are working and identify places in need of improvement. Meanwhile. this amendment mandates the timely establishment of program regulations. That measure should expedite the programs expansion and increase overall efficiency. These are critical improvements. and I urge support of Mr. SCHOCKS amendment.

1110056920,First of all. to the managers amendment and the issue about the purchasing of cars. I have been told that the current GSA policy that has jurisdiction in the purchasing of cars over the agencies in which this committee has jurisdiction thereof. that we have just restated that policy. It was not intended to be an earmark. It was not intended to do anything different. It is not authorizing on an appropriation bill. Its a restatement of GSA policy. If there is a reason to be against it. it would be because it was redundant. But we did not create any new legislation. We are just restating GSA policy as it concerns purchase of cars under the agencies. I rise in support of this amendment from the gentlelady from Michigan. In this bill the committee supports strong investment in renewable energy technologies. such as solar. wind and geothermal power. Water power is an important piece of this renewable portfolio. Refining conventional hydropower technologies can increase the efficiency of our Nations hydropower dams and cost effectively increase clean power generation without the need for new dams. Research and development of technologies that use waves. tides and streams for power can deliver a new source of virtually untapped renewable energy.

1110045895,Mr. Speaker. I have serious concerns about capandtrade legislation and its impact on the American people. especially rural communities. This. at its core. is a national energy tax which will be passed on to the American people. The stakes are even higher for our Nations agriculture industry. . Agriculture is an energyintensive industry. relying on fuel for the pickup truck. fertilizer for the crops. and generators to keep heaters on during the winter. The Third District of Nebraska is one of the largest agricultural districts in the country. home to more than 30.000 farmers and ranchers. And everyone knoivs that even a small increase in the operating costs would have dire results. As higher energy prices hit other areas of our economy. farmers and ranchers will pay more for seed. equipment. steel and other supplies. As the cost of production increases. so will the price of food on the shelves in urban areas.

1110029124,I thank the distinguished Member from California for yielding. The concurrent resolution before the House reflects President Obamas bold vision for investing in Americas future. Throughout the previous administration. a sustainable and clean energy policy was ignored and our dependence on foreign oil grew. I am proud that this Congress has done more in the past 2 months to promote energy efficiency and combat global climate change than the previous administration accomplished in a full 8 years. At the local level. I enlisted counties across the Nation to join Cool Counties. a program designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Now is the time for the Federal Government to take similar action. This budget increases investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency by 18 percent and provides for a clean energy policy that will safeguard our environment. our Nation. our economy. and create jobs. Through the use of a reserve fund. this budget makes significant energy investments in a deficitneutral manner. This Congress. through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. made almost $60 billion in energy investment-$39 billion in direct funding and $20 billion in tax incentives. Our actions will modernize our electricity grid. The current grid is outdated. inefficient and unreliable. A smart grid will enhance energy efficiency. lowering energy bills and improving air quality. A 5 percent increase. in the efficiency of the grid will eliminate carbon emissions equivalent to the emissions of 53 million automobiles. This Congress. through the Recovery Act. invested in the weatherization of millions of American homes. enabling families to better insulate their homes and lower energy bills. and we know that weatherization is among the most efficient ways of lowering our energy dependency on foreign oil. Investment in energy independence will benefit our economy. Instead of relying on foreign countries to meet our energy needs. this budget will promote the creation of green jobs right here in America. Instead of losing manufacturing jobs. as we have over the past 25 years. we can add jobs in wind and solar power generation. in the manufacturing of advanced batteries. in weatherization programs. in the creation of the smart grid. in the expansion of broadband. and in hybrid vehicle production. Investment in clean energy. Madam Chairman. is an investment in the American worker. It creates jobs. We must invest once again in America. in efficient automobiles and wind turbines. These investments will protect our climate and lay the groundwork for a new age of industrial expansion founded on technological innovation. The energy investments that this budget enables fulfill President Obamas vision- for clean energy -independence and promote a healthy environment while strengthening our economy.

Natural gas has an important role to play in United States energy policy because it is more domestically abundant and cleanerburning than traditional transportation fuel. We cannot afford to continue sending billions of dollars overseas while neglecting the vast energy resources right here in America. It is critical to our longterm economic prosperity that we invest in our own domestic sources of energy.

1100173624,Madam Speaker. I rise today in support of passing meaningful climate change legislation that includes programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Climate change is one of the most urgent issues of our time and will affect the whole world. but the brunt of the climate burden will undoubtedly be taken by the poorest populations. Lowlying coastal areas and urban inner cities are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The construction of interstate highways has concentrated greenhouse gases in urban communities and increased the prevalence of asthma in those areas. 70 percent of AfricanAmerican people live near environmentally unfriendly industries like coal fired plants. These plants emit greenhouse gases and other pollutants that adversely affect the air quality in the communities around them. The issue of climate change is not only about AfricanAmericans. but a much broader Black community. The Black Diaspora and Africans are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of environmental inaction. It is estimated that 75250 million Africans can be affected by the stresses that climate change has on water supply and a rapidly changing ecosystem. The ingenuity of the people of the United States will allow our country to become a leader in curbing global warming by paving the way with wellplanned legislation and creating jobs that will boost the economy. Prompt. decisive action is critical. since global warming pollutants can persist in the atmosphere for more than a century. The most important thing to remember is that the most expensive policy is that of doing nothing. We cannot afford not to take action. The impact that climate change has on our ecosystems. health. and food and energy costs is irreversible.

I believe. is a principal reason my constituents sent me to Congress. I admire the chairmans skill in assembling a bill. and I fully support the chairmans efforts to reduce the release of greenhouse .gases. However. Im deeply concerned that the bill does not include the research funding necessary to reach the target of 80 percent emission reduction set in the bill. We must transform the way we produce and use energy. We cannot meet this goal with todays technologies. and this bill. as written. will not provide the billions of dollars needed to fund and develop the future technologies.

1100180596,Mr. President. I would like to discuss a bill that I am introducing along with Senator HATCH today. the Carbon Reduction Technology Bridge Act of 2008. This bill is designed to develop the technologfes that will enable us to use coal in a manner that helps address the threat of climate change. Our country depends on coal to provide half of our electricity. In North Dakota. coal accounts for over 90 percent of our power. This is the power we need for lighting and heating our homes. powering our businesses. and. in the future. charging our cars. The U.S. has vast resources of coal. enough to last over 250 years. We need to ensure. that we can continue to enjoy the affordable electricity provided by coal. while developing technologies that will lower the greenhouse gas emissions that result from coal use. We need to advance carbon capture and storage technologies to address the reality of climate change. The scientific evidence is clear that human activity is increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. which contributes to warming temperatures. The increased occurrence of severe weather and other effects that we have seen to date are small in comparison to what scientists say are the likely consequences of continued warming. This bill will help jumpstart investment in technologies to capture and store carbon. It provides tax credits to the first generation of highly efficient advanced coal plants that capture carbon dioxide. It helps companies make the first investments in carbon capture and storage equipment on the first existing plants. It also provides credits for each ton of carbon dioxide captured and stored underground. It provides a number of other incentives to advance coal technology. The science on climate change is clear. but what is not proven is the technology that can provide the solution. This bill sets ambitious but achievable goals for those companies willing to be the first to address this challenge headon and build and install these technologies. Under this bill. a typical new coal plant would be required to capture 65 percent of its carbon dioxide emissions.

1100130948,Madam Speaker. this week and in the coming weeks the American people need this House and Senate and the President to work in a bipartisan fashion to come up with a monetary policy and a fiscal policy here that will help our economy. It needs to be temporary. timely and targeted. And I would hope that we can work with our Republican colleagues in a bipartisan fashion to direct that to people in the middle income and lower income levels who need the help and will spend the money immediately. To give rebates to people who are making a lot of money. people earning salaries such as we are in Congress. and others. is not the right thing to do. We need to give money to people who are suffering the most from the high gas prices. from the loss of employment. and from the other economic effects that are hurting the people at the bottom. I ask my Republican colleagues and the President. and hopefully he will in the State of the Union. address those who need. help the most and help this American and world economy.,110118990.0,COHEN,STEVE,H,TN,M,D,9.0,voting,H,2008-01-23,23,Mr. COHEN,Unknown,COHEN,Unknown,M,552,580,01232008.txt,1017,188,110,2008,come peopl need work bipartisan fashion come monetari polici fiscal polici help economi need temporari target work bipartisan fashion direct peopl incom lower incom level need help spend money give rebat peopl make money peopl earn need give money peopl suffer high price loss employ econom effect hurt peopl bottom union need help help world economi,86,0.41379310344827586,0.2647058823529412

1110068876,Mr. Speaker. I rise today to show my support for H.R. 4213. the Tax Extenders Package that includes several critical extensions important to Texas. The package will extend through 2010 the $1 per gallon credit for producing biodiesel and the $1 per gallon credit for producing diesel from biomass. which is especially important to my district as it is home to the struggling biodiesel industry. Texas is the leading producer of biodiesel in the nation. The industry supported up to 8.600 jobs in the State and over 50.000 jobs in the U.S. in the past year. It is both fiscally and environmentally responsible to extend these tax credits and to promote the development of biodiesel here at home. The biodiesel excise tax credit enables biodiesel to remain price competitive with conventional diesel. Without the prompt extension of the tax credits before they expire on December 31. 2009. we risk reducing the domestic production of low carbon. renewable energy sources that help our nation to significantly reduce carbon emissions. as well as our dependence on foreign oil. The biodiesel industry has already been forced to close several plants and is operating at about 20 percent capacity due in large part to the weak economy. A retroactive extension of the credit after December 31. 2009 could further exacerbate the industrys job losses. and place this important industry in a precarious position.

1110032877,Mr. Chairman. I actually rise in support of the amendment offered by Representative KOSMAS of Florida. The amendment simply directs the agencies under the interagency committee to assess the impacts of natural disasters on water resources. We know that national disasters such as floods. droughts. hurricanes and all of that can have a very significant effect on water levels and cause major disruptions in local communities. In my home State of Texas. we have recently seen the extremes of way too much water in the form of hurricanes and too little. many times in the form of droughts. Its important that we achieve a better understanding of the impacts of these natural disasters on water resources so that local managers and State officials can plan and manage for future use and economic growth. It simply makes sense that we coordinate efforts at the local. State and national level to achieve these ends. I have long been a proponent of this type of coordination. During the 109th Congress. I sponsored a bill to create the National Integrated Drought Information System. and I am proud to say the program is currently up and running. NIDIS coordinates and integrates observations so that local water managers cani better plan and can better predict for future uses. While our Nation will always face natural disasters of one form or another. we can do more to mitigate the effects through careful study and careful planning. The gentleladys amendment moves in that direction. and I urge its passage. Mr. Chairman.

1100166608,Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of this common sense piece of legislation offered by my dear friend. Representative CHARLIE RANGEL. the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. If enacted. his bill will marshal the tremendous economic power of our Nations physical and human capital and direct it towards solving the twin challenges of energy dependence and global warming. Through $20 billion investment in renewable energy tax incentives. carbon mitigation provisions. transportation efficiency tax credits. and energy efficiency incentives. this bill offers a comprehensive strategy that empowers both individual citizens and the private sector. The bill empowers everyday Americans by providing tax credits to green citizens who add energyefficient improvements to their homes and businesses and purchase plugin electric cars. The bill helps the private sector push the limits of research and development by encouraging the building of carbon capture and sequestration demonstration projects. The. bill also creates incentives for the energy production sector to invest in nontraditional cuffing edge energy production methods. I am particularly excited that this bill will. for the first time. incentivize investment in technologies that will harness the power of the waves and tides found in our Nations Great Lakes and oceans. I am also proud of this bodys recent efforts to address the global climate change crisis. This bill is a logical and important next step toward this end. For too long. our country lagged behind the rest of the industrialized world in recognizing and taking action to address the climate change crisis. Global warming endangers all of us. but threatens to have the most devastating impact on the poorest and the most vulnerable. By encouraging our Nations citizens and businesses to act in a carbonconscious way. we- protect not only ourselves. but show compassion for our brothers and sisters around the world. At a time when global public opinion regarding our Nation is at an alltime low. the important positive impact this bill will have on our countrys public diplomacy efforts should not be downplayed. Lastly. I believe that this bill serves as a powerful example of the tax policy differences between the 110th Congress and past Congresses. Instead of using the tax code to promote inequality and corporate largess. the American people now know that the tax cod9 can be used to promote personal responsibility. national security. compassion. and global sustainability.

1100164550,Mr. Speaker.-as a Member who represents Illinois farmers and rural communities. I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2419. the Food. Conservation and Energy Act of 2008. The Food. Conservation and Energy Act. which is endorsed by every major agriculture group in my home state of Illinois. is good for our farmers and maintains our ability to provide a safe. affordable and abundant food supply. This bill improves nutrition and conservation programs. and supports biofuel production at great benefit to the Illinois farm economy. E945 Most importantly. it extends a critical safety net to help farmers manage production risks when facing unsustainably low prices or natural disasters. Illinois receives the 4th most nutrition dollars in the nation. I was happy to see that neariy threequarters of all farm bill spending will go toward food and nutrition programs. including $50 million for food pantries to address the rising Costs of food and food shortages. The bill also increases conservation 6pending to safeguard agricultural lands from the pressures of urban and suburban development. and to protect our natural resources. Finally. the bill makes critical investments in Illinois rural communities through biofuel production. telecommunications and wastewater infrastructure projects. and healthcare. In this time of economic. hardship. we look to new industries to rebuild the economy of Illinois and the rest of the country. This bill puts $1 billion in programs that will leverage renewable energy industry investments in new technologies and feedstocks. It also provides $320 million for biorefineries producing advanced biofuels. and $300 million for the Bioenergy Program. which directly impact Illinois. I urge my colleagues to support final passage of this comprehensive legislation that funds important programs for rural and urban constituents across Illinois and our Nation.,,,,,,,,,,E,2008-05-15,991,Mr. HARE,Unknown,HARE,Unknown,M,57036,57092,05152008.txt,1895,287,110,2008,speakera repres farmer commun rise strong hr food conserv energi food conserv energi endors agricultur group home good farmer maintain provid safe afford food suppli improv nutrit conserv program biofuel product great benefit farm economi importantli extend safeti net help farmer product risk face unsustain low price natur disast nutrit nation happi see neariy farm spend toward food nutrit program includ million food pantri rise food food shortag also increas conserv safeguard agricultur land pressur urban suburban develop natur final make invest commun biofuel product telecommun wastewat infrastructur project healthcar econom hardship look new industri rebuild economi rest billion program leverag renew energi industri invest new technolog feedstock also provid million biorefineri produc advanc biofuel million bioenergi program directli impact final comprehens fund import program urban nation,179,0.2845528455284553,0.26136363636363635

It may have taken the president almost 8 years to acknowledge global warming. but this is a problem that Congress did not wait to address. Congress passed the historic and bipartisan Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to begin to reduce American dependence on foreign oil. respond to the global warming crisis. grow our economy. and lower energy costs. The Act will save 5.3 billion metric tons in energyrelated CO2 emissions from 20082030 and reduce oil consumption by 2.4 million barrels ? dayalmost a 25 percent reduction over todays usage.

1110055954,I thank the gentleman for yielding. June26. 2009 Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition to the American Clean Energy and Security Act. In my home State of Illinois. we depend on nuclear. coal. and natural gas for our electricity. Because this bill discriminates against these energy sources. Illinois will be hit especially hard. Gas prices could rise by 77 cents a gallon and diesel by 88 cents a gallon. This is part of an entirely arbitrary penalty on oil and gas that is passed straight on to the consumer. H.R. 2454 does little to incentivize new nuclear production. despite the fact that nuclear power is safe and emissions free. and what little it does is grossly inadequate concerning the overall goal of this bill. I am deeply concerned also that there is no framework for an international agreement on climate change in this bill. In the absence of such framework. and in agreement from developing nations. my district can count on losing thousands of jobs to countries like India and China if this legislation is enacted.

1110032869,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself as much time as I may consume. I thank Chairman GORDON for bringing this important bill to the floor to address our water research needs. Access to clean and reliable water supplies is an issue that affects every community across our country. In my district along the central Florida coastline. local communities also must deal with the other impacts of weather conditions such as hurricanes. which have the potential to affect our water supplies. However. this is not just a coastal issue. as recent floods in North Dakota and Florida. tornadoes in Tennessee and Alabama. and other weather events across the country. have exhibited to us and show us the need for this to be addressed at a national level. My amendment. which adds a provision to the Water Research Outcomes and Assessments section. mandates an assessment of the impacts of major weather events on our water supplies. Hurricanes. floods and tornadoes can lead to salt water intrusion. infrastructure damage. sewer overflows. storm water runoff and other conditions that can harm our water supplies and the surrounding environment. A better understanding of these impacts will aid local communities and States in addressing water supply issues before. during and after major storms. Combined with the provisions in this bill. including the requirement to develop innovative tools to enhance water treatment and water purification technologies. this amendment will help address the impacts of major weather events over the long run through the development and implementation of policies to prevent and mitigate such vulnerabilities to our water supplies. A nationally coordinated assessment of major weather events will ensure that our constituents have access to safe. reliable water supplies without interruption and that providers will be able to meet Federal standards and that we will use our resources in a more costeffective and efficient manner.

1110056258,Madam Speaker. I rise in strong support of H.R. 2454. the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009. This groundbreaking legislation will help protect our environment and create an estimated 37. million jobs in the United States over the next 20 years by significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions. implementing a renewable electricity standard. providing incentives for the adoption of energy efficiency measures. and promoting renewable energy technology research and development. H.R. 2454 also provides assistance to developing countries to help them adapt to the effects of climate change. deploy clean energy technologies. and reduce emissions from deforestation. Some of the worlds poorest countriesincluding those that have contributed the least to the problem of climate changewill suffer the mostimmediate and severe consequences of global warming if we dont take action to reverse it. Many developing countries face the threat of flooding. the loss of arable lands. and the spread of climaterelated diseases. such as malaria and cholera. A recent World Bank study estimated that storm surges resulting from rising sea levels could threaten 52 million people and 29.000 square kilometers of agricultural land in developing coastal countries around the world. H.R. 2454 will help people in lowincome countries prepare for and adapt to climate change by strengthening local planning capacity and promoting the development and implementation of national adaptation programs. This legislation also provides financial and technical assistance and leverages private sector involvement to mitigate the emissions of greenhouse gases in developing countries. This will help reduce the impact of climate change here in the United States and benefit the American economy by encouraging innovation in green technologies and the creation of high qualityjobs. Finally. the bill will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by helping lowincome countries reduce emissions associated with deforestation. Madam Speaker. the programs on international adaptation. clean technology. forestation as well as provisions for international offsets will all require close collaboration between the Environmental Protection Agency. the United States Agency for International Development. and the Department of State. In international negotiations on framework agreements to carry out these programs. I expect the Department to continue to have responsibility to approve the initiation of such negotiations. consistent with current law and regulations. I also expect that USAID. which has significant expertise in dealing with a range of environmental activities overseas. will play a central role in planning and helping administer these critical programs. Madam Speaker. the international provisions in this legislation are crucial for the successful completion of climate change negotiations in Copenhagen later this year. They will demonstrate to the rest of the world that the United States is truly committed to working cooperatively with other nations to tackle the global challenges of climate change. I thank my good friends Chairman WAXMAN and Chairman MARKEY for working closely with me to develop and refine the international provisions in this important legislation. and urge all of my colleagues to vote yes.,111116630.0,BERMAN,HOWARD,H,CA,M,D,28.0,voting,H,2009-06-26,624,Mr. BERMAN,Unknown,BERMAN,Unknown,M,60680,60761,06262009.txt,3311,483,111,2009,rise strong hr clean energi groundbreak help environ estim million job next significantli greenhous emiss implement renew electr standard provid incent energi effici measur promot renew energi technolog research develop hr also provid assist develop help effect climat deploy clean energi technolog emiss deforest world poorest countriesinclud contribut least problem climat changewil suffer mostimmedi consequ global warm dont take revers develop face threat flood loss arabl land spread climaterel diseas malaria cholera world bank estim storm surg result rise sea level could threaten million peopl squar kilomet agricultur land develop coastal around world hr help peopl lowincom prepar climat strengthen local plan capac promot develop implement nation program also provid financi assist leverag sector mitig emiss greenhous gase develop help impact climat benefit economi encourag green technolog high qualityjob final help greenhous emiss help lowincom emiss associ deforest program intern clean technolog forest well provis intern offset close collabor environment intern develop depart intern negoti framework program expect depart continu respons negoti consist current also expect usaid signific expertis deal rang environment oversea play central role plan help program intern provis crucial success complet climat negoti copenhagen later demonstr rest world truli work nation tackl global challeng climat good waxman work close develop refin intern provis import,293,0.2702702702702703,0.25925925925925924

1100188815,Madam Speaker. Exelon. an energy company which provides electricity to my district in Pennsylvania. recently announced a voluntary goal of reducing. offsetting. or displacing more than 15 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year by 2020. This is more than the companys current annual carbon emission total and is equivalent to taking nearly 3 million cars off American roads and highways. The campaign. called Exe]on 2020. will pursue three broad strategies: first. reduce or offset Exelons carbon emissions by reducing energy consumption and operating to the highest environmental standards. secondly. help customers and the commur.ities in which they serve to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through energy efficiency programs and a diverse portfolio of green products and servizes. and third. offer more lowcarbon electricity in the marketplace.

1110059246,Mr. Chairman. the legislation before us would reauthorize the Department of Energys Vehicle Technologies Program. which invests in advanced vehicle research and development. This program taps American ingenuity to create goodpaying American jobs and. importantly. reduce our dependence on foreign oil. The Advanced Vehicle Technology Act requires the Energy Secretary to research and develop advanced automobile battery manufacturing. Automotive batteries for plugin hybrids and electric vehicles are promising. but they are not yet fully competitive in the market. Congressman SESTAKs amendment would require the Secretary to consider two additional factors in bringing advanced batteries for plugin vehicles and electric cars to market. First. electric vehicle batteries are limited by the number of times they can be charged and depleted before the battery fails entirely. To extend battery life cycles. vehicle manufacturers oversize the batteries. often extending battery life but then sacrificing cost and efficiency in the process. The gentlemans amendment would require research and development of technology to efficiently increase battery life. Second. vehicle battery manufacturing is an energyand emissionsintensive process. which ultimately contributes to an electric vehicles carbon footprint. Congressman SESTAKs amendment would require the Energy Secretary to research and develop new technologies to increase efficiency in the battery manufacturing process. I thank Chairman GORDON. and I urge support for Mr. SESTAKs amendment. Mr. Chairman.

1110030287,Mr. President. this amendment seeks to establish a deficitneutral reserve fund based on the current law supporting revenue sharing for coastal States contributions to the Land and Water Conservation Fund and a fund for innovative energy technology. It would save up to. which is the current law today. which 26 Senators voted on. up to 50 percent which can be set aside from future oil and gas revenues for revenue sharing for coastal States for the Land and Water Conservation Fund And for funds to be created to invest in alternative energy technologies. This is something tlat has been debated in the Senate but has been broadly supported by Republicans and Democrats. There has been some opposition. I suspect there may be some today. But there has been broad bipartisan support for revenue sharing for coastal States contributions to the Land and Water Conservation Fund and alternative energy sources.

The program will focus on improving safety and minimizing environmental impacts during produced water recovery.

1100170646,"Act is founded on three fundamental principles: First. science solves problems. The sciefitific consensus is now unequivocal that global warming is happening. that manmade greenhouse gas emissions are largely responsible. and that we must reduce those emissions substantially over the coming decades if we. are to avert a climate catastrophe. We have a moral obligation to listen to that scientific consensus and act upon it. by starting .today to reduce global warming pollution to levels that will keep our planet safe for generations to come. Second. investing solves problems. We must invest in the American economy and in American workers. and launch an energy technology renaissance that will rival the information technology revolution of the past decade. We all benefited from the Industrial Age. and we have watched the dawn of the Information Age. Today. we must start the Clean Energy Age. This bill will provide a marketbased push that will trigger an explosion of energy technology development that will give us the same ""Wow"" feeling that we get from our information technology--bringing robust economic growth while meeting our climate goals. Third. American leadership solves problems. We must ensure America is the world leader in confronting our climate crisis. giving us the credibility and the technology to bring China. India. and the rest of the developing world under one large. climatesaving tent. In so doing. America will help protect vulnerable communities around the world from the dangers of global warming. including drought. famine. and flood.

1100202830,Mr. President. I am pleased to be here to follow up on the comments from the chairman of the Energy Committee. As one of the senior members on the committee. I have had an opportunity to work with him and Ranking Member DOMENICI on many of the issues he has talked about. as we have tried to advance energy policies for the country. One of the things we recognize on the committee historically is there has been a very good. strong. bipartisan relationship. working together to advance policy goals. The point has been made that perhaps politics has intervened as we have tried to advance some policies of late. I would like to think that as we begin a new Congress next year. with the initiative before us that this country needs and deserves a good. comprehensive energy policy that works for the Nation. that gets us to a point that allows for a level of energy security for us. that we will do so in a way that is cooperative. collaborative. and that allows us to move the technologies and advance the infrastructure that is necessary. that allows us to have policies in place that not only provide for increased domestic production but renewables and alternatives. with a focus on conservationtruly an energy policy that works. I look forward to working with the chairman in advancing these goals.

1100196042,Madam Speaker. Republicans say they favor an alloftheabove solution to our Nations energy crisis. Yet their record from the past 8 years tells us something different. Republicans have consistently voted against critical solutions that should be a part of a comprehensive energy package. For instance. they voted against important tax provisions needed for renewable energy and energy efficiency industries. They voted against responsible drilling. They voted against efforts to protect consumers from speculators who manipulate our markets. They voted against measures to bring down oil prices. And lastly. they voted against American workers by not supporting green collar jobs. These votes and others show the true Grand Oil Party whose primary goal is to protect the record profits of big oil companies. If my colleagues are really serious about supporting an alloftheabove energy proposal. then they should join Democrats and support a sensible and comprehensive energy package.,110116060.0,SOLIS,HILDA,H,CA,F,D,32.0,voting,H,2008-09-11,16,Ms. SOLIS,Unknown,SOLIS,Unknown,F,693,720,09112008.txt,982,147,110,2008,favor alloftheabov solut nation energi crisi us someth consist solut part comprehens energi packag instanc import provis need renew energi energi effici industri respons drill effort consum specul manipul market measur bring price lastli worker green collar job show true parti whose primari goal profit big compani realli seriou alloftheabov energi propos sensibl comprehens energi packag,91,0.3188405797101449,0.2553191489361702
1100182112,Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 4174. the Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act. I commend our colleagues on the Science Committee for bringing forward this important legislation to enhance our understanding of this phenomena. which is changing the very chemistry of the worlds oceans. Ocean acidification. which is caused by increased atmospheric carbon dioxide. can negatively affect a range of organisms. from corals. to shellfish and plankton. These organisms and their habitats form the base of the food chain for many marine fish and mammal species. If not mitigated. ocean acidification could. therefore. have a cascading negative effect on important commercial fisheries. tourism and recreation. and other oceanrelated industries. The damage that ocean acidification could cause to our coastal economic and cultural livelihoods is alarming. Those who rely on oceanic resources for their food or their livelihood. as many of my constituents on Guam do. are already contending with the negative afteraffects caused by coastal habitat degradation. overfishing. illegal. unregulated. and unreported fishing. and the worldwide decline of healthy coral reefs. We need to learn now everything we can about the dynamics. extent and implications of ocean acidification it we hope to be able to develop successful strate_gies to cope with this global threat. I strongly support this legislation that would establish a comprehensive. interagency committee to coordinate and expand federal research on ocean acidification and marine ecosystems. Mr. Speaker. I commend our colleague from Maine. Mr. ALLEN. for introducing this legislation and for his leadership on ocean issues. I also commend the gentleman from Texas. Mr. LAMPSON. the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment. and the Ranking Member. Mr. INGLIS. for advancing H.R. 4174 through the Committee on Science and Technology. I thank them and Chairman GORDON for working with Chairman RAHALL of the Committee on Natural Resources to address matters of mutual interest and shared jurisdiction with regard to the bill.

1110020536,Mr. President. I have sought recognition to comment on my cosponsorship of the Clean. LowEmission. Affordable. New Transportation Efficiency Act. CLEAN TEA. This bill. which I introduced along with Senator CARPER. would establish a fund for transportation initiatives designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The fund would be supported by 10 percent of the proceeds of any future capandtrade system established by Congress to address the issue of climate change. The funding could be used by States and local planning organizations for the development of projects such as rail. transit. transitoriented land use and other initiatives designed to reduce emissions from the transportation sector. It is important to note. however. that the bill is not focused solely on providing alternatives to auto use. Highway operational improvements such as demand management programs and intelligent transportation systems would also be eligible if they reduce emissions by utilizing highway capacity in a more efficient manner. These are important steps in lowering our Nations greenhouse gas emissions. reducing our dependence on foreign oil and promoting transportation mobility. Since transportation accounts for onethird of greenhouse gas emissions. it stands to reason that revenue generated from a capandtrade system should be devoted to creating a more sustainable transportation future.,111114511.0,SPECTER,ARLEN,S,PA,M,D,,voting,S,2009-03-12,136,Mr. SPECTER,Unknown,SPECTER,Unknown,M,8627,8666,03122009.txt,1388,203,111,2009,sought recognit cosponsorship clean lowemiss afford new effici clean tea introduc along carper establish fund greenhous emiss fund percent futur capandtrad establish issu climat fund could local plan develop project rail transit transitori land emiss sector import note focus provid auto highway improv program intellig also emiss highway capac effici import lower nation greenhous emiss depend foreign promot mobil sinc greenhous emiss stand gener capandtrad futur,125,0.43333333333333335,0.2549019607843137

1110056071,Madam Speaker. this bill is not only everything that the opponents have said it is. but it is also a massive transfer of wealth from the United States to foreign countries. And the- reason it is that is because this bill legalizes offsets. Over 40 percent of the offsets that have been created under the Kyoto Protocol have come from China. The $2.2 trillion that will be transferred through purchase of offsets in foreign countries will be the largest nonmilitary foreign aid bill that this House of Representatives has ever passed. The chart that is beside me here shows that the $2.2 trillion in foreign giveaways is equal to 210 times the amount of money we give to help people with domestic heating oil and propane: 119 times the amount of money we give for making buildings more efficient. 111 times the money we give for clean vehicle technology. 33 times the money that we give for domestic natural gas consumers. 11 times the amount that we give for the domestic industrial sector. and five times the amount that we give to help out our domestic electric consumers. Madam Speaker. this money should be spent at home. We have enough problems at home that we have to deal with. and I think the Congress has recognized this today. But lets not send more money overseas. money that will come through higher prices at the pump. higher bills from our utilities. higher food prices when we buy them in the supermarket. Vote this bill down. and keep the money at home.,111121310.0,SENSENBRENNER,F.,H,WI,M,R,5.0,voting,H,2009-06-26,437,Mr. SENSENBRENNER,Unknown,SENSENBRENNER,Unknown,M,55031,55074,06262009.txt,1469,260,111,2009,everyth said also massiv wealth foreign legal offset percent offset kyoto protocol come china trillion purchas offset foreign largest nonmilitari foreign aid repres ever chart show trillion foreign giveaway equal amount money give help peopl domest heat propan amount money give make build effici money give clean vehicl technolog money give domest natur consum amount give domest industri sector amount give help domest electr consum money home enough problem home deal recogn money oversea money come higher price pump higher higher food price buy supermarket money home,126,0.32098765432098764,0.2545454545454545

1110033057,Well. if the gentlelady will yield back. let me say that part of the progressive vision is to implement provisions of a renewable electricity standard which will create over 300.000 jobs. implement an energy efficient resource standard so we can get energy savings to create over 222.000 new jobs by 2020. By cutting waste. we save money. The renewable electricity standard alone will result in nearly $100 billion in savings for consumers and businesses by 2030. Efficiency savings. the energy efficiency resource standard will result in nearly $170 billion in utility bill savings by 2020. Opponents of that change that Americans are demanding are not going to be the ones who are remembered finally by history. The ones who oppose efficiency and renewable energy. these are the samd folks who are in danger of directing U.S. energy policy.

1110048818,Madam Speaker. as the House is soon to consider comprehensive climate change legislation. I would like to illustrate how individual states stand ready to lead the effort to combat global warming and are willing to take extremely ambitious and necessary stands. On March 12th. my home state of Massachusetts passed a resolution committing to repower America with 100 percent clean electricity in the next ten years. The resolution was successful in large part because of the tireless efforts of Massachusetts Power Shift. a grassroots organization of climate advocates. Global warming is no longer an academic question for scientists to ponder. Its a very real crisis that requires American leadership. This is not a political issue. this is a critical generational responsibility that will take a commitment from every American. The renewable technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and move towards energy independence exist. the societal will and desire to go green have been demonstrated. and the political climate to finally create sound public policy to do so is now present. Repowering America with clean energy will create jobs. reduce our dependence on foreign oil. and -help reduce greenhouse gas emissionsthe clearest solution to preserving our natural treasures for future generations.

1100170650,"bill also invests heavily in technologies that will drive that lowcarbon economy. The best. brightest. and cheapest source of clean energy is efficiency. That is why the iCAP bill devotes tens of billions of dollars each year---in partnership with State and local governmentsto making our homes. buildings. and transportation systems more efficient. The bill invests tens of billions more in research. development. and deployment of the cuttingedge lowcarbon energy technologies that will power Americas future--including renewable energy. cellulosic ethanol. advanced hybrid vehicles. and carbon capture and sequestration. Unfortunately. even if we act now to avert catastrophic global warming. some climate change is already inevitable. Accordingly. the iCAP bill devotes substantial funding to increasing resilience--both here in the United States and in the most vulnerable developing countriesto those impacts. Finally. the bill sets up a system of carrots and sticks to encourage other countries to take action to combat global warming. The bill establishes an intemational forest protection fund to reduce heat trapping emissions from tropical deforestation. It also gives major developing countries that take ""comparable action"" to reduce global warming pollution access to an international clean technology fund. to promote deployment of lowcarbon energy technologies.

And countries that fail to take comparable action by 2020 will have to buy special reserve allowances to cover the emissions generated by any covered primary goodslike iron and steel. aluminum. cement. glass. or paperthat they import into the United States. These incentives will help to ensure that all countries band together to combat global warmingas we must if we are to preserve our precious planet. Climate change represents the single greatest threat now facing humanity. but it also presents an unprecedented opportunity. The iCAP Act represents a bold and comprehensive response to that challenge and opportunity. I urge my colleagues to support this billto take action now to avert a climate catastrophe. to protect our national security. and to unleash a green energy revolution that will bring prosperity and robust economic growth to America.

1100146537,"Madam Speaker. last weeks report of the February jobs figuresa net loss of 63.000 jobsis yet another sign that we need to act to spur employment. We need to stimulate the economy and to create the good jobs that will help working families across the country achieve the American dream. I would like to bring my colleagues attention to a recent study that gives us new information on how to achieve that goal. The study. completed by economists at the University of MassachusettsAmherst. evaluates the economic relationship between public spending and job creation. The study. ""The U.S. Employment Effect of Military and Domestic Spending Priorities."" concludes that public dollars invested in health care. education. mass transit or construction for home weatherization and infrastructure create more jobs than investing an equivalent amount in either military or personal consumption through tax cuts. The study evaluates the relative effects on -job creation of investing an equivalent amount of federal dollars in three scenarios: (1) private consumption through tax cuts. (2) the military. and (3) domestic investments. This important study finds each billion dollars of federal funding would create: 10.799 jobs if spent on tax cuts designed to spur personal consumption. 8.555 jobs if allocated for military spending. 12.883 jobs if invested in health care. 17.687 jobs if invested in education. 19.795 jobs if invested in mass transit. 12.804 jobs if invested in home weatherization and infrastructure. The bottom line is that public dollars invested in health care. education. mass transit. or construction for home weatherization and infrastructure -create more jobs than investing an equivalent amount in either the military or personal consumption. I hope that my. colleagues will review this study. and I would like to thank the Womens Action for New Directions (WAND). the Institute for Policy Studies. and the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of MassachusettsAmherst for their work in this area.",,,,,,,,,,E,2008-03-13,1701,Ms. SCHAKOWSKY,Unknown,SCHAKOWSKY,Unknown,F,72363,72411,03132008.txt,2031,313,110,2008,last report job figuresa net loss jobsi anoth need spur employ need stimul economi good job help work famili achiev dream like bring attent give us new inform achiev goal complet economist univers massachusettsamherst evalu econom relationship spend job us employ effect domest spend conclud invest health care mass transit construct home weather infrastructur job invest equival amount either consumpt cut evalu rel effect job invest equival amount three scenario consumpt cut domest invest import find billion fund job cut spur consumpt job spend job invest health care job invest job invest mass transit job invest home weather infrastructur bottom invest health care mass transit construct home weather infrastructur job invest equival amount either consumpt like women new direct wand institut polici polit economi research institut univers massachusettsamherst work area,192,0.32673267326732675,0.25
1110055831,I thank my friend from Oklahoma for yielding. I have more concerns with this legislation than I even have time to discuss. But since agriculture is Pennsylvanias number one industry and because Im a member of the House Agriculture Committee. I would like to focus on the alarming effects capandtrade will have on the farmers in my home State. This legislation. through mandates. attempts to decrease our use of fossil fuels. The whole point of capandtrade is to make fossil fuels. or 85 percent of the energy we consume. more expensive. Fossil fuels are essential for energy and electrical generation and also are equally important to use as a feedstock in many goods that we utilize. Agriculture is an energyintensive industry. and natural gas will be capped under this legislation. Natural gas is a basic ingredient in fertilizer. which is a building block for all of the food the U.S. supplies. We cant make our food without fertilizer. and we cant make fertilizer without natural gas. The dairy industry in my State is having a difficult time making profits because of falling milk prices. And while there are many reasons for low milk prices. energy costs are certainly part of that equation. This legislation will do nothing toreduce our carbon emissions or help Pennsylvania agriculture and will only cause more economic hardship for many small farmers and businesses.

1110056406,Madam Speaker. a national energy tax will doharm to American families by raising electric bills. gas prices. and food prices by thousands of dollars. Moreover. it will not achieve the goals of a cleaner environment. As our European neighbors have learned from their own cap and trade scheme. costs go up but so do carbon emissions. Indeed. in the socalled market place of carbon trade. the American people will lose just as our European friends have America will lose jobs and American families will lose money. and there is no excuse for the Democrat leadership in this House to place such a burden upon the American people. I hope my colleagues will abandon this plan to raise taxes and realize that an allzoftheabove approach to our energy needs--one that has bipartisan support--is a far better course for this country to pursue.

I strongly support promoting increased use of renewable energy and developing renewable energy technologies. Currently. renewable energy sources account for only two percent of our Nations electricity supply. We need to increase the supply of clean. renewable energy. but we also need to be more energy efficient and slow the growth of demand. H.R. 5351 would extend tax incentives for wind. geothermal and biomass energy through 2012. and extend the tax incentives for solar electric systems through 2016. The bill also extends credits for consumer purchases of energy efficient products through 2014. and creates a credit for plugin hybrid vehicles for The Production Tax Credit (PTC) helps the United Statescreate thousands of megawatts of new. clean. renewable electricity. and has been a major driver of Wind and solar power development. To fund these tax credits. this bill will repeal some of the tax breaks we give to the oil companies. I have long advocated repealing some of the tax breaks we give oil companies as ""incentives."" and voted that way. because our current marketplace provides adequate incentive for oil and gas exploration.

1110049792,Mr. Speaker. last week. the House passed House Resolution 492. recognizing this week as HighPerformance -Building Week. The resolution aims to provide greater public awareness about the benefits of highperformance .buildings. and it works to increase education about the impact buildings have on our environment. Each year. our homes. offies. schools. and other buildings consume 70 percent of our electricity. 60 percent of all raw materials. and they emit 40 percent of all CO2 emissions in the U.S. By designing and building highperformance buildings. we reduce energy consumption and our carbon footprint. We save both water and raw materials. We save demolition and construction debris from going into landfills. Most importantly. ighperformance building construction creates goodpaying jobs that give workers the valuable skills they need to excel in a clean energy economy. It is my hope that Members will use this week to highlight the importance that buildings have on our environment and for Congress to continue to support future research. development and the deployment of highperformance building technologies.,111116720.0,CARNAHAN,RUSS,H,MO,M,D,3.0,voting,H,2009-06-15,43,Mr. CARNAHAN,Unknown,CARNAHAN,Unknown,M,9615,9646,06152009.txt,1123,169,111,2009,last recogn highperform build aim provid greater awar benefit highperform build work increas impact build environ home school build consum percent electr percent raw emit percent co emiss us build highperform build energi consumpt carbon footprint water raw demolit construct debri landfil importantli ighperform build construct goodpay job give worker valuabl skill need excel clean energi economi highlight import build environ continu futur research develop deploy highperform build technolog,97,0.2876712328767123,0.25

1100207831,Mr. President. I have been working with Chairman BAUCUs and his staff for the past year on an amendment to the section 45 productioi tax credit. My amendment modifies the definitions of qualified openloop and closedloop biomass facilities to clarify that additional power generation units placed in service at existing qualified facilities are eligible for the production tax credit. This clarification was necessary to remove an ambiguity as to whether such additional units of power qualify for credit. This ambiguity was inadvertently created by language in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 relating to additional units of power appended to municipal sold waste facilities. As you know. my concern has been that the failure to clarify that additional units of power do qualify for the credit will discourage taxpayers from expanding existing biomass electricity production facilities and. thus. from producing more renewable biomass electricity. However. it appears that the language that was adopted by the Senate on September 23 does not achieve the goal of eliminating this ambiguity in all circumstances.

1110068313,Thats right. And so is the entire IPCC report. CO2 is a trace gas. It is a plant food. It is beneficial to all of life. CO2 is a modest gas. Methane is 23 times more powerful at trapping heat. Sixtyfive percent of the heattrapping gases come from water vapor. We are not going after them because we are going after people. What you learn when you discover that CO2 levels follow the temperature changes is that theres a reason for it. And the reason is this: we go through ice ages and global increases and declines in temperature. And as the temperature declines globally. the trees at the top of the mountain start to die for lack of photosynthesis. and then the bushes. and then the grasslands. And the dust that blows in the winds that are always here blows out across the oceans. And part of that dust is lead. And when that lead settles to the bottom of the oceans. it catalyzes growth in the largest biological mass we have in this planet. the plankton. And that growth demands CO2 to keep going. Now the oceans contain 70 times as much CO2 as the atmosphere does. And as the plant life. the plankton. pulls that CO2 out of the oceans. homeostasis. or equilibrium. causes more Cu2 to come out of the atmosphere and into the oceans. The reverse happens when the planet warms up through more solar activity. So colder oceans hold more CO2 than warm oceans. And when the planet cools off. the CO2 winds up in the oceans and out of the atmosphere. We have 388 parts per million today.,111115770.0,LINDER,JOHN,H,GA,M,R,7.0,voting,H,2009-12-08,459,Mr. LINDER,Unknown,LINDER,Unknown,M,19451,19491,12082009.txt,1487,275,111,2009,that entir ipcc report co trace plant food benefici life co modest methan trap heat percent heattrap gase come water vapor peopl learn discov co level temperatur there ice age global increas temperatur temperatur global tree top mountain die lack photosynthesi bush grassland dust blow wind alway blow ocean part dust lead lead bottom ocean catalyz growth largest biolog mass planet plankton growth co ocean contain co atmospher plant life plankton pull co ocean homeostasi equilibrium caus cu come atmospher ocean revers happen planet warm solar colder ocean co warm ocean planet cool co wind ocean atmospher part per million,126,0.21839080459770116,0.25

If we had true destruction of those refineries. which could have easily happened. we are talking about a real vulnerability. real price shocks at the pump. and a long time before we can get this infrastructure back up and running. The point is with a comprehensive energy policy. we are going to diversify our sources of energy. We need to expand refining capacity and build out in other areas of the country. We need to invest in the alternative fuels that will give us alternatives to gasoline. but it takes time for those investments. Clearly. it is important that we start the process. In my district. a large oil company has just recently put a significant. investment into an alternative fuel company that is going to be making cellulosic ethanol.

1100135409,"talks about peak oil. The United States peaked in 1970 and the world at large is about -ready to peak. We looked at in just the last couple of years more than a doubling of the cost for a barrel of oil. The issue is similar in -global warming. which is called today climate change. Why is there a difference in the verbiage on discussing global warming? The difference in verbiage is that global warming will cause the climate to change. disruptions in the climate. Is there global warming? Well. there is a 90 percent certainty among the American scientists and international scientists that global warming is linked to human activity. That means the burning of fossil fuel. Lets take a quick look at one example as to why we link global warming to human activity. We can go scientifically back 20.000 years at the height of the last ice age and we can test through a number of different means. especially ice cores. 20.000 years ago. I want to make one other comment also. If you look over the past 20.000 years. you will see a fluctuation. a variation in climate change. and you will alsosee a fluctuation in variation of temperature. The temperature corresponds to the amount of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. The more greenhouse gasses over the eons of time. the warmer the climate. If we go back 20.000 years to the height of the last ice age. carbon dioxide. which is the chief greenhouse gas. one of the chief greenhouse gasses. there was 180 parts per million of C02 in the atmosphere. As a result of that small amount of C02. we were in an ice age. It was very cold. ""As climate variability changes over the course of time. we come to 1890 when we could evaluate how much C02 was in the atmosphere. 1890. a little over 100 years ago. there was 280 parts per million of C02 in the atmosphere. It took basically nearly 20.000 years to go from 180 partsf per million of C02 to 280 parts per million. an increase of 100 parts per million over 20.000 years. . Well. what were we really involved in in 1890? The industrial revolution. the burning of coal. the early stages of the age of oil. It is 2008. There are 380 parts per million of C02 in the atmosphere. What does that mean? That means the natural cycle took 20.000 years to increase C02 by 100 parts per million. and during the industrial age. it took just 100 years to increase C02 by 100 parts per million. The correspondence to warming is linked to the amount of greenhouse gasses. So we are warming.. There are many. many other examples of this. receding glaciers worldwide. shrinking ice sheets on Greenland. temperature of the air and temperature of the water. Another problem is the acidification of the oceans. The point here is that we a re facing enormous changes in a very short period of time. Will we be ready? We are facing peak oil. In some sense. in maybe less than 100 years. we will be at the end of the Asian oil. and what will we replace this enormous source of energy with? We are facing enormous changes in the next few decades with the climate changing as a result of human activity. Lets take just a brief look at some of the issues of a changing climate. What will it do to agriculture in the United States with the drought and rain cycles changing. and we are already beginning to see that. What will it do to our national forests and forests globally with the infiltration of pests that werent there before? We see that now in the northern regions of Alaska and wild fires. fresh water. quantity and quality with changing rain cycles. coastal zones. flooding areas. more hurricanes. We have already seen more tornadoes. What abofit sea level rise? This is an important aspect of global warming. If sea level rose just a couple of feet. and there is a good chance it will rise more. what will happen to New York City or Miami or New Orleans or a town close to me called Chestertown? How will the ecosystems change? What will diseases be like in areas that are a lot warmer? We only need now to look at some of the areas of central Africa or Central America or South America. Ocean acidification is an issue with the kinds of marine life that will be in the worlds oceans. Ocean acidification has a direct impact on the spawning activities of all the sea mammals and the other marine creatures in the ocean. Global warming. 90 percent assurance from the worlds scientists that human activity is causing it to change. It is changing the face of our planet. the link with the other issue of energy. The lack of it will change dramatically the face of our planet if we dont select the right priorities as soon as we can. What are some of the questions we ask about this scene. this relatively confusing scene of an energy crisis with nothing right now to replace it. and- a global warming climatechange. crisis. some of the confusing issues. Are we in just another cycle of high energy costs and different climate? We know that climate 6cles change. and we know that energy costs change over a period of time. Are we not just in another cycle? Well. this time we are not just in another cycle. But if you want to say we are in a cycle. this cycle is being dramatically affected by human activity. In the energy crisis arena. we are burning more oil than we have in reserves. In the climate crisis arena. we are burning fossil fuel. infusing greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere in the last few decades that it took millions of years for the natural processes to lock up. Now. one last comment. and then I want to go back to my good friend from Maryland who will go over some of the issues that can ameliorate the problem with the climate crisis. the problem with the energy crisis. Both these issues. energy crisis and climate change. are going to take something in the order of magnitude that we dealt with in the Man. hattan Project and sending a man on the Moon. This is an economywide issue. The economy issue and the global warming issue are economywide. and they are international in scope. One of the suggestions for the global warming issue is an economywide cap and trade program. similar to what we dealt with from sulfur dioxide and acid rain from power companies a little more than 10 years ago. which has been very successful. a cap and trade program. economywide. where you actually trade carbon in a similar way that you would trade stock on the stock market. You place a cap on the emission of C02 and other greenhouse gasses. You incrementally implement this over a period of 40 years -and gradually. by the year 2050. you can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 70 percent below 1990 levels by finding alternatives to fossil fuel. What is at the bottom of the bottomless pit? We used to think it was oil. that we could burn it forever and it wouldnt hurt the environment. But we now know its not oil. What needs to be at the bottom of the bottomless pit is ingenuity. good oldfashioned American ingenuity.

1100129943,Mr. Speaker. last month at a hearing of the Subcommittee on Energy and Water of the Appropriations Committee we heard expert. corroborated testimony that heating and cooling and the electrical fixtures and appliances in buildings in the industrial. commercial and residential sectors use nearly 50 percent of all the energy that is used in America today and thereby were responsible for nearly 50 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming. We were also told that we could reduce by onehalf the energy used in new or renovated buildings using present knowledge and technology. One month ago. because of the powerful and insistent leadership of Speaker NANCY PELOSI. and the critical cooperation of Chairmen DINGELL and MARKEY and a host of others from both parties. this Congress passed and the President signed landmark energy legislation. That new law focused heavily on reducing the fossil fuel used in transportation by raising corporate average fleet efficiency standards to 35 miles per gallon by the year 2020 and mandating production of 36 billion gallons of biofuel. mostly ethanol. by the year But equally important were some provisions relating to buildings. what I have said already. which use nearly 50 percent of all the energy used in America today. First. the increased energy efficiency standards for appliances used in commercial and residential buildings. second. the goal that all commercial buildings built after the year 2025 would use zero net energy. third. that all federally constructed buildings would reduce their general energy usage by 30 percent by the year 2015. and fourth. that all new Federal buildings reduce their fossil fuelproduced energy by 55 percent in 2010 and eliminate by 2030 all fossil fuelproduced energy. Our first - opportunity to meet the spirit of this landmark energy bill comes in the bill before us tomorrow. the reauthorization of the Hope VI program. This reauthorization proposes a rejuvenated program at $800 million a year which with just Hope VI dollars alone could produce as many as 4.000 units per year of housing. affordable housing for people with low income. Put in perspective. those potential affordable housing units represent less than 0.1 percent less than 1/1000th of the housing built in this country each year. and virtually all of the cost is borne by the Federal Government. The bill includes an extremely important provision that projects must use green community criteria to be eligible for the Federal funding. Numerous cities and even States already require or use compliance with such green community criteria. Washington. DC. for instance. requires the criteria for all residential construction. not just public construction. Washington State requires criteria stronger than the kreen community,110116990.0,OLVER,JOHN,H,MA,M,D,1.0,voting,H,2008-01-16,332,Mr. OLVER,Unknown,OLVER,Unknown,M,64275,64364,01162008.txt,2800,442,110,2008,last month hear subcommitte energi water heard expert corrobor heat cool electr fixtur applianc build industri commerci residenti sector nearli percent energi america respons nearli percent greenhous emiss caus global warm also told could energi new renov build knowledg technolog month ago insist nanci pelosi host parti landmark energi new focus heavili fossil fuel rais corpor averag fleet effici standard mile per gallon product billion gallon biofuel mostli ethanol equal import provis relat build said alreadi nearli percent energi america first increas energi effici standard applianc commerci residenti build goal commerci build built zero net energi construct build gener energi usag percent new build fossil fuelproduc energi percent fossil fuelproduc energi first meet landmark energi come us tomorrow reauthor program reauthor propos rejuven program million alon could produc per afford peopl low incom perspect potenti afford repres percent built virtual born includ extrem import provis project green commun criteria fund citi even alreadi complianc green commun criteria instanc criteria residenti construct construct criteria stronger kreen commun,263,0.35119047619047616,0.24770642201834864
1100200390,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. It is my pleasure to put before the House today H.R. 6323 by Mr. JIM SENSENBRENNER. ranking member of the Investigations and Oversight Subcommittee of the Science and Technology Committee. By enhancing the Department of Energys research program in heavyduty hybrid trucks. this bill draws muchneeded focus to a very critical component of the transportation sector. commercial trucks. We are learning the hard way just how much the health of our economy can hinge on the commercial transportation sector. Skyrocketing fuel costs translate directly into higher prices for consumers since the large majority of products we consume or use. from food to building materials. are at some point transported by medium to heavyduty truck. We must take measures to ensure that this remains a vibrant economic sector. The heavyduty truck sector also plays a role in our energy security and environmental health. Approximately onefourth of the Nations fuel use and the majority of transportationbased emissions can be attributed to heavyduty trucks. One large tractortrailer rig uses as much fuel annually as 48 passenger vehicles. We can see how even small improvements in their efficiency can have a substantial impact. As with passenger vehicles. hybrid technologies hold the greatest promise for improving the fuel economy and emissions of commercial trucks. but considerable research and development is required to put these technologies on the road. While the technological requirements for hybrid trucks are very different. advances in this sector can benefit the domestic automotive sector as a whole by invaluable lessons learned in designing and manufacturing these systems.,110119300.0,EDWARDS,DONNA,H,MD,F,D,4.0,voting,H,2008-09-22,543,Ms. EDWARDS of Maryland,Unknown,EDWARDS,Maryland,F,28700,28750,09222008.txt,1727,267,110,2008,consum hr jim sensenbrenn rank investig oversight subcommitte scienc technolog enhanc depart energi research program heavyduti hybrid truck muchneed focu compon sector commerci truck learn hard way health economi hing commerci sector skyrocket fuel translat directli higher price consum sinc larg product consum food build point medium heavyduti truck take measur ensur vibrant econom sector heavyduti truck sector also play role energi environment health approxim onefourth nation fuel transportationbas emiss attribut heavyduti truck larg tractortrail rig fuel annual passeng vehicl see even small improv effici impact passeng vehicl hybrid technolog greatest promis improv fuel economi emiss commerci truck consider research develop technolog road technolog hybrid truck advanc sector benefit domest automot sector whole invalu lesson learn manufactur,156,0.2702702702702703,0.24691358024691357
1100183258,I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his question. We believe now. as we did when we passed the act into law. that for training to benefit working families and their communities. it must respond to the skills needs of thriving industries that lead to familywage jobs. An example of this is the green jobs sector. Innovative States. such as my own State of Washington. are leading the expansion of career opportunities in the green economy. making sure that opportunities are readily available for workers to acquire the skills to qualify for these good jobs. In fact. Washington State set a new goal to increase the number of clean energy jobs to 25.000 in the next 12 years and committed to finance the necessary training. Innovative workforce boards across the country increasingly are providing training for green collar jobs that will be critical in meeting the demands of a lowcarbon economy and providing workers with quality jobs. And Congress also is taking action. As a member of the Committee on Appropriations. I supported the recent passage the Labor/ Health and Human Services bill. we reported that a greater training investment needs to be made in areas such as renewable electric power. biofuels. energyefficiency assessment and environmentally sustainable manufacturing and directed the Secretary of Labor to competitively award community based job training grants in these areas.

1100153423,Madam Chairman. I rise in support of the Congressman INSLEES amendment to H.R. 2537. reauthorization of the BEACH Act. This amendment calls for a study of the longterm impacts of climate change on the pollution of coastal waters. At its center. the intent of the BEACH Act is to provide information and notification for the public with regard to the safety of the coastal waters they use for recreation. It is wellknown that climate change may cause significant changes to ecosystems. hydrology. and water temperature. WIfat we are unsure of. however. is the extent to which these changes will occur. and alsoimportantlythe effect this will have on public health. For example. if coastal water temperatures increase and freshwater inflows decrease. does this result in a more hospitable environment for pathogens in our coastal waters? Because the publicincluding children--are in direct contact with these waters. it is of the utmost importance that we have a better understanding of what a warming environment means for public health. The Transportation & Infrastructure Committee included a similar provision in last summers energy bill. This program called for a National Academy of Science study to be conducted on the impacts of climate change on water quality. and subsequent ramifications of these changes on the Clean Water Act. While this provision did not survive conference. I am pleased that Mr. INSLEES amendment picks up in a similar vein.

1100149035,Madam Speaker. I rise today to applaud Don Buttress of Little Elm. TX. for his commitment to bettering the environment. Don applied for a rebate through the Texas Emissions Reduction Program (TERP) to replace an earlymodel dump truck with one that is cleaner and more efficient. Dons efforts demonstrate the effect a single persons actions can have on the planet. Buttress rebate will keep 11.1793 tons of nitrogen oxides from polluting our skies throughout the next seven years. TERP is committed to replacing 4.500 older diesel engines with newer. less polluting models. and Dons participation moves them one engine closer to reaching that goal. The Texas Emissions Reduction Program presents businesses with the opportunity to go green by trading in their vehicles for cleaner. more economical diesel engines. TERP provides rebates and grants to help replace aging diesel engires that consume more fuel and generate more pollution than newer models. North Texas businesses have saved over $3.3 million and reduced neariy 353 tons of pollution to date. The Texas Emissions Reduction Program serves as a national model for replacing and retrofitting older diesel engines. Madam Speaker. it is with great pride that I rise today to congratulate Joel Estrada of the 26th District of Texas. His efforts are something I encourage other small businesses to follow. and I gladly congratulate him for his contribution to the betterment of North Texas.,,,,,,,,,,E,2008-04-03,720,Mr. BURGESS,Unknown,BURGESS,Unknown,M,69791,69824,04032008.txt,1445,230,110,2008,rise applaud buttress elm tx better environ appli rebat emiss program terp earlymodel dump truck cleaner effici don effort demonstr effect planet buttress rebat ton nitrogen oxid pollut sky next terp older diesel engin newer pollut model don particip move engin closer reach goal emiss program green trade vehicl cleaner econom diesel engin terp provid rebat help age diesel engir consum fuel gener pollut newer model north million neariy ton pollut date emiss program nation model retrofit older diesel engin great pride rise congratul joel estrada effort someth encourag small gladli congratul contribut better north,140,0.3010752688172043,0.24615384615384617

1100197389,Mr. Speaker. very shortly this Congress. this Domocratic Congress. is going to do what the Republicans failed to do for more than a decade of their leadership. a.d that is to present and vote on a comprehensive energy package that will expand renewable sources of energy for the future and create goodpaying jobs here in America. This plan for the 21st century extends :ax incentives for renewable energy. hybrid cars. energyefficient buildings and homes. It requires utility companies to generate 15 percent of their electricity from renewable sources such as wind. geothermal and solar power. This is our new energy future. And the legislation forces oil companies to pay their fair share for drilling on the American peoples land. Big Oil should pay taxpayers to use their land. We will use that money. $15 billion. to develop clean energy sources and alternative fuels. to develop greater efficiency and improve conservation. InvEstments in renewable energy will create hundreds of thousands of goodpaying- jobs here in America. at a time when the Bush economy is shedding tens of thousands of jobs every month.

1110040100,Mr. Speaker. America can become the world leader in the new clean energy economy. To ensure our ecohomic recovery is sustainable for years to come. we intend to pass comprehensive clean energy legislation that will create millions of new American jobs that cannot be shipped overseas. reduce our. dependence on foreign oil. increase productionof cleaner. renewable energy sources. crack down on heavy pollutants who have damaged our air and water quality. and give American entrepreneurs and innovators the tools they need to stay competitive in the global economy. There is also the Energy and Commerce bill called the American Clean Energy and Security Act. It will invest in American jobs that cannot be shipped overseas. It will reduce our dependence on.foreign oil. It will be consumer focused and increase production of cleaner. renewable energy sources.,111116170.0,WATSON,DIANE,H,CA,F,D,33.0,voting,H,2009-05-13,276,Ms. WATSON,Unknown,WATSON,Unknown,F,15322,15345,05132009.txt,860,135,111,2009,america becom world leader new clean energi economi ensur ecohom recoveri come intend comprehens clean energi million new job ship oversea depend foreign increas productionof cleaner renew energi sourc crack heavi pollut damag air water qualiti give entrepreneur tool need competit global economi also energi call clean energi invest job ship oversea depend onforeign consum focus increas product cleaner renew energi sourc,83,0.26229508196721313,0.24444444444444444
1110040102,Mr. Speaker. Americans are an optimistic people. That was confirmed yesterday when results came out showing that Americans believe. by a 21 margin. that we will grow clean energy jobs by the millions when we adopt a clean energy bill in this House. and they are right. We should be optimistic that we are going to build electric cars and sell them to the rest of the world. not just China. We ought to be optimistic that we are going to build concentrated solar energy technology and sell it to the rest of the world. We ought to be optimistic that we are going to build the electric batteries that will fuel our cars and help make our grid more responsive. This is the optimism that those of us have who are going to pass a clean energy bill this year to make this happen. Here is another reason for optimism. Yesterday we reached a consensus in the House Energy and Commerce Committee. With broad swathes of the country. the southnorth industrial egg. we have reached a consensus that we are going to grow jobs everywhere in this country because we are the op-. timists. and the optimists are going to win this clean energy debate.,111116310.0,INSLEE,JAY,H,WA,M,D,1.0,voting,H,2009-05-13,278,Mr. INSLEE,Unknown,INSLEE,Unknown,M,15399,15431,05132009.txt,1133,206,111,2009,optimist peopl confirm result came show believ margin grow clean energi job million clean energi optimist build electr car sell rest world china ought optimist build concentr solar energi technolog sell rest world ought optimist build electr batteri fuel car help make grid respons optim us clean energi make happen anoth optim reach consensu energi broad swath southnorth industri egg reach consensu grow job everywher op timist optimist win clean energi,97,0.26229508196721313,0.24444444444444444

1110058499,Madam President. I stand in opposition to this amendment. The funds contained within this High Cost Energy Program are designed to improve energy generation. transmission. and distribution. These are designed to do exactly what we are working so hard in this body to do: to improve our energy generation. our transmission facilities. our distribution facilities. and we are doing this through a program where the qualifications in order to comply are you have to serve communities in which the average residential home energy costs are 275 percent of the national average. There are 14 States across the country that have projects that focus on these very high energy areas. We are trying to reduce our energy costs for renewables and through the standard energy mechanisms but. quite honestly. when your energy costs are 275 percent above the national average. it is pretty darn tough. So these are funds made available to communities in the State of Alaska. but also communities in Arizona. California. Florida. Hawaii. Idaho. Kentucky. Maine. Massachusetts. Nevada. New Mexico.

I believe in the alloftheabove energy policy that includes more energy domestically. Unfortunately. in our home State of Texas. the construction of wind farms has been delayed because such farms interfere with radars used by the FAA.

1100139850,Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 5351. the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of 2008. With this legislation. we take another step forward in the fight to combat global warming and achieve energy independence. It is critical to our Nations futurb that we invest in the energy sources of the 21st century. H.R. 5351 does this by reforming the Tax Code to reflect Americas energy priorities. The bill includes. extends. and expands tax incentives for biodiesel production. solar energy and fuel cell investment and energy efficiency improvements to existing homes. The bill also provides new incentives for plugin hybrid vehicles and cellulosic ethanol production. These investments will help us achieve my goal of reducing -greenhouse gas emissions by 6080 percent by 2050 in order to limit the effects of global warming. In the interest of fiscal responsibility. H.R. 5351 pays for these investments in the energy resources of the future by cutting subsidies for industries that clearly need no help. The bill saves $18 billion by ending tax loopholes and subsidies for multinational oil and gas companies which are already reaping huge. record profits. No longer will oil and gas companies be able to game the Tax Code by understating their income from foreign oil and gas extraction. These long overdue reforms send a clear message that oil and gas companies will no Remarks Pebruary 28. 2008 longer get privileged treatment while Americans pay higher fuel prices and home heating costs. H.R. 5351 also demonstrates that clean energy investments can create new jobs in addition to benefiting the environment. By extending the renewable energy production tax credit for wind. biomass. geothermal. and other renewable energy sources. the bill provides new opportunities for job growth in these areas. With its stellar research institutions and wealth of experts on engine design. Michigan has the potential to reap significant benefits from this legislation. Governor Jennifer Granholm has made clear her commitment to creating greencollar jobs through a renewable energy mandate and other reforms. I look forward to building on the progress made in this bill. With future reforms we can Continue to reduce greenhouse emissions. secure our energy independence. and create new green industry jobs for Michigan and America.,,,,,,,,,,E,2008-02-28,419,Mr. DINGELL,Unknown,DINGELL,Unknown,M,24751,24806,02282008.txt,2347,371,110,2008,rise hr renew energi energi conserv take anoth fight combat global warm achiev energi independ nation futurb invest energi sourc st centuri hr reform reflect america energi includ extend expand incent biodiesel product solar energi fuel cell invest energi effici improv exist home also provid new incent plugin hybrid vehicl cellulos ethanol product invest help us achiev goal greenhous emiss percent limit effect global warm interest fiscal respons hr pay invest energi futur cut subsidi industri clearli need help billion loophol subsidi multin compani alreadi reap huge profit longer compani game underst incom foreign extract long overdu reform clear compani pebruari longer get treatment pay higher fuel price home heat hr also demonstr clean energi invest new job benefit environ extend renew energi product credit wind biomass geotherm renew energi sourc provid new job growth area stellar research institut wealth expert engin potenti reap signific benefit jennif granholm clear greencollar job renew energi reform look build progress futur reform continu greenhous emiss energi independ new green industri job america,231,0.2550335570469799,0.24324324324324326

1110056244,"Madam Speaker. I thank you for allowing me the time to speak on this topic of paramount importance. Climate change and the problem of rising carbon emissions is one of the most important public policy quandaries that the nation currently faces. Congress needs to take the lead in helping to solve this issue. Therefore. I implore my fellow members of Congress to vote yes and help pass the American Clean Energy and Security Act. H.R. As you well know. H.R. 2454 is a broadbased bill that includes a number of initiatives on clean energy. economic development. and climate change. Taken together. these initiatives will create the national policy framework and- all important funding streams that are needed to adequately tackle the threat posed by rising carbon emissions. Moreover. the incentives contained within H.R. 2454 will help strengthen and support those emerging renewable energy industries to help create jobs that will enable millions of Americans to get back to work. I know that these jobs will be created because I havealready seen it happening in my home state of Pennsylvania. I have seen the jobs created by the wind and solar manufactures. and I have spoken to the leaders of local Philadelphia business who have told me how important the clean energy industry is to the Philadelphia region. Moreover. I have read the studies that show how many jobs will be created if Congress passes H.R. 2454. For example. in a 2008 report published by the Clean Air Council entitled ""Job Opportunities for the Green Economy."" it was estimated that over 533.000 jobs in Pennsylvania alone will see growth or wage increases by putting global energy solutions to work. As the world moves into a less carbon intensive future. these new industries will allow the country to thrive as they become the new economic engines that power future growth. I believe that our nation needs a comprehensive energy strategy that makes our nation more energy efficient. decreases our reliance on foreign oil. creates jobs. and helps prevent increases in carbon emissions. I am not alone in my beliefs. People throughout the nation want Congress to get moving on reducing carbon emissions. These Americans understand that climate change is one of the most important issues that fade the nation today. They understand that the rapidly changing climate that is due to rising carbon emissions is having a profound impact on the nations forests. coastal areas. drinking water. and other important ecosystems that human beings rely on. Therefore. I implore my fellow members of Congress to pass the American Clean Energy and Security Act.

1110034075,School works in conjunction with the Washington Park Greenhouse. which is connected to the Cleveland Public School District through South High School. The STEM School students recently made some recommendations to increase energy efficiency of the greenhouse. General Electric staff worked with them hand in hand while using the suggestions of the students to renovate the greenhouse. The students then took measurements of humidity. temperature. and other levels before and after and compared the result to measure the progress of their work. The STEM students are currently working on developing automated watering systems for the greenhouse pumps to conserve energy and water for the plants. They are in the process of creating designs and testing to see which one works best. I believe that the MC Squared STEM School has the ability to be a catalyst for change across our Nation. Children who are taught by educators with proper certification and mentored by professionals are more likely to succeed and prosper in an increasingly technologically advanced society. It is for this reason I planto offer an amendment to the STEM Coordination Act of 2009 in the Committee of Science and Technology. which I am a member. with the intent to increase the members of certified teachers in lowperforming areas of our country. Increasing the number of qualified teachers in our country in science and math will only help our Nation spur the renewable energy revolution. In conclusion. Mr. Speaker. I would like to thank Congresswoman BARBARA LEE. the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus. for allowing this important discussion on energy during our message hour. We must work to strengthen all facets of our society when discussing an unfolding energy revolution in the 111th Congress. We have a great opportunity to protect our environment and strengthen our economic interest through the creation of additional sources of energy such as biofuel. wind. and solar. Mr. Speaker.

1110032108,Mr. Speaker. the Democrat leadership is moving forward on the change that theyve promised. Last week. the EPA. Environmental Protection Agency. moved forward to regulate carbon dioxide emissions under the Clean Air Act. with or without congressional consent. This week the Committee on Energy and Commerce is holding hearings on capandtax legislation. And this is what were learning. The renewable energy requirements in the bill are entirely unrealistic. Currently. 3 percent of our electricity that is generated is by renewable energy. and the chairmans bill is mandating 25 percent by 2025. That would require 20.000 megawatts of renewable energy to come online every year until 2025. That is far above what the projections are. the governmentgenerated projections. So our question is. are we saddling our States and our energy consumers with unrealistic demands and mandates at prohibitively high prices? Well. basically. the Democrat leadership presents a choice. We can acquiesce to bad regulation that will have certain and disastrous impacts on our economy. or we can legislate an even more harmful system. Basically. Mr. Speaker. its as though. when faced with a gun to our heads. we are taking it and opting to shoot ourselves in the chest.,111118630.0,BLACKBURN,MARSHA,H,TN,F,R,7.0,voting,H,2009-04-22,343,Mrs. BLACKBURN,Unknown,BLACKBURN,Unknown,F,19310,19353,04222009.txt,1250,198,111,2009,move theyv promis last epa environment move carbon dioxid emiss clean air without congression consent energi hear capandtax learn renew energi entir unrealist current percent electr gener renew energi percent megawatt renew energi come onlin far project governmentgener project saddl energi consum unrealist prohibit high price well basic choic acquiesc bad certain disastr impact economi even harm basic though face gun take opt shoot chest,104,0.34146341463414637,0.24074074074074073
1100170468,Mr. President. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the LiebermanWarner Climate Secu.rity Act. This bill addresses the most significant environmental challenge facing our country. The scientific evidence clearly demonstrates the human contribution to climate change. According to recent reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. increases in greenhouse gas emissions have already increased global temperatures. and likely contributed to more extreme weather events such as droughts and floods. These emissions will continue to change the climate. causing warming in most regions of the world. and likely causing more droughts. floods. and many other societal problems. In the United States alone. emissions of the primary greenhouse gas. carbon dioxide. have risen more than 20 percent since 1990. Climate change is the most daunting environmental challenge we face and we must develop reasonable solutions to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. I have observed in person the dramatic effects of climate change and had the opportunity to be briefed by the preeminent experts. In 2006. on a trip to Antarctica and New Zealand. for example. I learned more about research by scientists at the University of Maine. Distinguished National Academy of Sciences member George Denton took us to sites in New Zealand that had been buried by massive glaciers at the beginning of the 20th century. but are now ice free. Fifty percent of the glaciers in New Zealand have melted since 1860an event unprecedented in the last 5.000 years. We could clearly see the glacial moraines. where dirt and rocks had been pushed up in piles around the glacial terminus in 1860. I thought it was remarkable to stand in a place where some 140 years ago I would have been covered in tens or hundreds of feet of ice. and then to look far up the mountainside and see how distant the edge of the ice is today. In Antarctica. I visited the Clean Air Station at the South Pole. Being the farthest place on Earth from major emissions sources. the South Pole has the cleanest air on Earth. and thus provides an excellent place to measure the background quality of the Earths air. By analyzing. carbon dioxide in ice cores. scientists have been able to create reliable measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide going. back over hundreds of thousands of years. The measurements of carbon dioxide at Clean Air Station provide a reliable comparison to document the impact of human activity on increasing carbon dioxide concentrations in recent years compared to the last hundreds of thousands of years. The melting is even more dramatic in the Northern Hemisphere. In the last 30 years. the Arctic has lost sea ice cover over an area 10 times as large as the State of Maine. and at this rate will be ice free by 2050. In 2005 in Barrow. AK. I witnessed a melting permafrost that is causing telephone poles. planted years ago. to lean over for the first time ever. I also learned about the potential impact of sea level rise during my trips to these regions. If the West Antarctica Ice Sheet were to collapse. for example. sea level would rise 15 feet. flooding many coastal cities. In their 2007 report. the IPCC found that due even just to gradual melting of ice sheets. the average predicted sea level rise by 2100 will be 1.6 feet. but could be as high as 1 meter. or almost 3 feet. In Maine a 1meter rise in sea level will cause the loss of 20.000 acres of land. include 100 acres of downtown Portlandincluding Commercial Street. a major business thoroughfare along the water. Already in the past 94 years. a 7 inch rise in sea level has been documented in Portland. The time has come to take meaningful action to respond to climate change. My colleagues worked tirelessly in recent months to develop legislation that will preserve our environment for future generations while providing reasonable emission reduction goals. offsets. and incentives for the industries covered by the bill. I applaud the leadership of my colleagues from Virginia. Connecticut. and California in bringing this bill to the floor this week.,110118301.0,COLLINS,SUSAN,S,ME,F,R,,voting,S,2008-06-04,883,Ms. COLLINS,Unknown,COLLINS,Unknown,F,34070,34194,06042008.txt,4107,688,110,2008,proud liebermanwarn climat signific environment challeng face scientif evid clearli demonstr human contribut climat report intergovernment panel climat increas greenhous emiss alreadi increas global temperatur like contribut extrem weather event drought flood emiss continu climat caus warm region world like caus drought flood societ problem alon emiss primari greenhous carbon dioxid risen percent sinc climat daunt environment challeng face develop solut greenhous emiss observ dramat effect climat brief preemin expert trip antarctica new zealand exampl learn research scientist univers distinguish nation scienc georg denton took us site new zealand buri massiv glacier centuri ice free percent glacier new zealand melt sinc event unpreced last could clearli see glacial morain dirt rock push pile around glacial terminu thought stand place ago feet ice look far mountainsid see distant edg ice antarctica visit clean air station south pole farthest place earth emiss sourc south pole cleanest air earth provid excel place measur background qualiti earth air analyz carbon dioxid ice core scientist reliabl measur atmospher carbon dioxid back thousand measur carbon dioxid clean air station provid reliabl comparison impact human increas carbon dioxid concentr compar last thousand melt even dramat northern hemispher last arctic sea ice area larg rate ice free barrow ak wit melt permafrost caus telephon pole plant ago lean first ever also learn potenti impact sea level rise trip region antarctica ice sheet collaps exampl sea level rise feet flood coastal citi report ipcc found even gradual melt ice sheet averag predict sea level rise feet could high meter almost feet meter rise sea level caus loss acr land includ acr downtown portlandinclud commerci street thoroughfar along water alreadi inch rise sea level portland come take meaning respond climat work tirelessli month develop preserv environ futur gener provid emiss goal offset incent industri applaud california bring floor,386,0.22727272727272727,0.24064171122994651
1100166299,Mr. President. both the international community and experts from across our country have come to a definite consensus. Climate change is not a theory. It is a reality. We may not like it. but we have to confront it. Rising temperatures. melting icecaps. and extreme weather show the increasing effects of global warming in the United States and especially around the globe. Without action. we will be unable to avoid dangerous consequences for our children. grandchildren. and subsequent generations. We risk the health of our citizens. the wellbeing of our coastal areas. the productivity of our farms. forests. and fisheries. . There is solid support in this institution and around the country for a mandatory capandtrade approach to reducing carbon emissions. All three Presidential candidatesSenators OBAMA. CLINTON. and McCANand both political parties have agreed on this philosophy. The Senate passed the LiebermanWarner bill out of committee in December. It is likely to reach the floor of the Senate in the next few weeks. I am not saying a climate change bill will pass this year. I am saying a climate change bill will pass. No more burying our heads in the sand. no .more ignoring the issue and putting it off for another day. It is not a question of -whether. it is a question of when and a question of what it will look like.

1110037199,Mr. Speaker. I rise today to bring light to a very important but often overlooked industry that can play a huge role in improving energy efficiency. both in our buildings and through greenhouse reductions on a widereaching scale: its mechanical insulation. Buildings are responsible for 40 percent of U.S. energy demand and 40 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions. Mechanical insulation. as it is used in mechanical piping and equipment for heating and air conditioning in industrial. commercial and other types of buildings. can reduce over 37 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions. It can also generate more than $3.6 billion in industrial energy efficiency. saving and creating more than 27.000 jobs annually. Savings and benefits are swift and can last for many years when properly implemented. As an advocate of energy efficiency measures.

1110044559,"Mr. Speaker. the capandtrade bill currently working its way through the House is nothing more than a national energy tax. The right to emit carbon would essentially be auctioned off to generate revenue for more government spending programs. amounting to a major tax increase for all American consumers. This proposed capandtrade is actually a capandtax system that will increase taxes. eliminate jobs. or drive them offshore. and raise the cost of energy and the price of purchasing any product or service dependent upon energy. Many sources have looked at this .and said that. it will cost about $4.000 per household. if not more. Even the President expects energy prices to rise. and describes them as skyrocketing. This national energy tax will be disastrous. particularly in light of our Nations current economic circumstances. As an alternative.

1110033463,Mr. President. I rise in opposition to the Stabenow motion to instruct. She is correct that it imposes limitations on climate change legislation as adopted during the budget resolution. with one very important deletion. and that is one that consumers care about the most. which prevents consumers from having to pay higher gasoline prices and electricity rates. If the Senate adopts this motion. it will undermine an amendment I offered to the Senate budget resolution. which passed 89 to 8 in the Senate. which prevents consumers from having to deal with higher gas and electricity rates as a result of climate change legislation. That is an important protection. It is something the conferees need to keep in the budget resolution.

1110043157,"Thank you. Congressman AKIN. I appreciate being involved .in this discussion. This is a national energy tax. This will not solve our problems with pollution. but what will? Sometimes we Republicans are called the ""party of no."" and its because we need opportunities to express our better ideas. Indeed. I believe we do have better ideas. and some of them are being illustrated by the chart that Mr. AKIN has on the board right now. We have opportunities to clean up the technologies and sources of energy that we have right now. We have the .opportunity to increase the number of hybrid and zeroemission vehicles on the road. We have the opportunity to increase wind and solar and biofuels. We have the opportunity to add to the amount of natural gas that we use because it is. by far. the cleanest burning hydrocarbon. We have opportunities to sequester the C02 that comes from coal. and as we know. coal is more than half of the eledtricity that is produced in this countryt So. -to Abandon coal abruptly. is just not possible. We should pursue ways to clean it up. That includes sequestering carbon. My State of Wyoming has the most advanced carbon sequestration laws in the country. which say that the pores under the surface where carbon can be sequesteredor captured and securedbelong to the surface owner. and that liability for the escape of hydrocarbons that are introduced into those pores are on the companies that put that carbon in the ground. So that creates a mechanism that other States are looking at right now. including Montana and others that are following Wyomings lead. In addition. we need to produce from coal liquid products that burn less. In addition. we need more nuclear energy.

The new evidence indicates. ""after taking into account worldwide land use changes. cornbased ethanol will increase greenhouse gasses by (a staggering) 93 percent compared to gasoline over a 30year period.""

On this day we are reminded of the importance of protecting our environment for generations to come. Established in 1970. Earth Day commemorates the birth of the modern environmental movement. Thirty eight years ago today. 200 million Americans from coasttocoast took to the streets to demonstrate the importance of environmental stewardship and conservation. Their voices are still heard today. as we continue to celebrate Earth Day globally. We must act responsibly and expediently to protect our environment by addressing global warming. Scientists worldwide agree that global warming is a reality and its consequences will be devastating and farreaching. Protecting our environment is not only crucial for this generation. but for the many generations to come. By implementing environ-. mentally responsible policies today. we will ensure that our children and grandchildren will have clean water to drink and clear air to breathe. We must focus on developing renewable energy. reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. expanding access to sustainable resources. and increasing environmental consciousness. This Congress has taken great strides to these ends. but there is still much work to be done. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the goals and ideals of Earth Day. May we continue to make environmental issues a top priority of the 110th Congress.,,,,,,,,,,E,2008-04-24,773,Mr. SHULER,Unknown,SHULER,Unknown,M,46650,46685,04242008.txt,1463,229,110,2008,rise goal ideal earth day day remind import environ gener come establish earth day commemor birth modern environment movement eight ago million coasttocoast took street demonstr import environment stewardship conserv heard continu celebr earth day global respons expedi environ global warm scientist worldwid agre global warm realiti consequ devast farreach environ crucial gener gener come implement environ mental respons polici ensur children grandchildren clean water drink clear air breath focu develop renew energi depend fossil fuel expand access increas environment conscious taken great stride work done goal ideal earth day continu make environment issu top,133,0.2828282828282828,0.23943661971830985
1110021912,I very much appreciate the perspective you bring to this discussion. and I very much appreciate you referencing the Stern report. This is an opportunity. we both serve on the Speakers Select Committee for Energy Independence and Global Warming. having a chance to deal with the British Parliament hearing and Sir Nicholas Stern lay out the result of his research. And by a 51 margin. the cost. the risks. the costs that we are looking at were far greater than any cost of implementation. and as you have outlined in great detail. there are many opportunities. if we do this right. to revitalize our economy. to reduce costs right now to American families. Just four categories of climate damage alone. hurricanes. higher energy bills. property lost to rising sea level and watersupply impacts are predicted to cost the average family $2.000 a year by 2025. by 2050. that increases another 50 percent to $3.000 a year. and by the end of the next century. $11.000 per family. just for those elements. Now. those estimates ignore. because they are a little hard to quantify. but as you pointed out. they are real. The added cost of drought. flood. wildfires. the mud slides that follow. agricultural damage and the value of lost life. We saw thousands of people lose their lives a few years ago in Europe. in France. We saw hundreds of people die in the Midwest.

1110048737,Mr. POLIS. if I might. to the comments made by Representative CONNOLLY of Virginia. and I thank him for his insight. to those comments I would add that as we achieve those efficiency outcomes. we are also cleaning the environment. We have the moral responsibility t6 make certain that our children. our grandchildren. generations that will follow us. do not get handicapped by some sort of situation out there like climate change. global warming. the carbon footprint. that will destroy our environment. The air we breathe is essential. and as stewards today of the environment that we inherited. we must pass it on to further generations. future generations. in a state that -is acceptable. clean and better. improved. so that we can achieve that. While we are on the battery situation. I would just make quick mention of GE. Their corporate headquarters are in Schenectady. which is housed within the 21st Congressional District within New York State. which I represent. GE recently announced its intentions to build an advanced battery manufacturing center in the capital district region of New York. That will provide -some 350 to 400 jobs for a stateoftheart battery that will deal with sodium chloride and nickel as a combination. adding to the diversity. There are lithiumion batteries that are spoken of and other sorts of batteries: that are being encouraged. This provides for diversity. which is sound for our mix. It is good for our energy choices. That battery will be able to be used for heavy vehicles. That is important. It can be used.foi intermittent energy storage. and it can be utilized also for energy generation. So the transportation sector. the energy generation and energy storage areas can all be addressed by this battery innovation. That is the key that can unlock the door to immense potential and opportunities of all kinds. So we are at the cusp. I believe. of tremendous discoveries here that will allow us to compete effectively in this global race to be the energy goto nation.,111121570.0,TONKO,PAUL,H,NY,M,D,21.0,voting,H,2009-06-10,790,Mr. TONKO,Unknown,TONKO,Unknown,M,54727,54783,06102009.txt,2012,336,111,2009,poli might repres connolli insight achiev effici also clean environ moral respons make certain children grandchildren gener us get handicap sort situat like climat global warm carbon footprint destroy environ air breath steward environ inherit gener futur gener clean better improv achiev batteri situat make quick mention ge corpor headquart schenectadi st congression new repres ge announc build advanc batteri manufactur center capit region new provid job stateoftheart batteri deal sodium chlorid nickel combin divers lithiumion batteri sort batteri encourag provid divers sound good energi choic batteri heavi vehicl import usedfoi intermitt energi storag also energi gener sector energi gener energi storag area batteri key unlock door immens potenti kind cusp believ tremend discoveri allow us compet effect global race energi goto nation,161,0.25806451612903225,0.2391304347826087
1110026094,"Mr. President. I rise for a colloquy with the chairman of the Finance Committee. Senator BAUCUS. to discuss section 1302 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. ARRA. which the President signed into law on February 19. 2009 (Public Law 1115). That section establishes a new tax credit. known as the section 48C credit. for investment in advanced energy facilities. I am very pleased that ARRA establishes this new credit. Because until now. all of our investment tax credits for renewable energy technologies have been concentrated downstream that is. at the commercial or individual consumer level. While those incentives have created some U.S. jobs. such as in installation. most advanced energy technologies that are installed in the United States continue to be manufactured overseas. One major driver for this overseas manufacturing is the significant tax incentives that other countries offer. For instance. Malaysia and the Philippines offer solar photovoltaic manufacturers income tax holidays. for 15 years in the case of Malaysia. while Germany offers them up to 50 percent of investment costs. As a result. the U.S. is far behind. and is falling further behind. in ""clean tech"" manufacturing. According to one recent study. Japan represents 45 percent of global solar cell production while the United States accounts for just 9 percent. And European manufacturers now account for more than 85 percent of the global wind component market. But just as the U.S. is losing ground in advanced energy manufacturing. we can anticipate rapid near- to midterm growth in domestic demand for renewable energy technologies. This demand will be driven by numerous factors. including last years extension of the commercial and residential investment tax credits through 2016. extension by ARRA of the production tax credit through 20132012 for wind. and declining product costs. anticipated enactment of national requirements for renewable electricity deployment. and anticipated enactment of a marketbased system or tax to limit carbon emissions. But under the status quo. the corresponding growth in domestic demand would largely have been satisfied by imports. For that reason. I worked with my friend from Montana. Senator BAUCUS. to establish in ARRA the first tax credit for investment in advanced energy facilities those that manufacture property that enables Americans to harness renewable resources to generate energy. to make energy efficient- improvements. and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I thank Senator BAUCUS for sharing my commitment to putting our country on the -path to being a leader in advanced energy manufacturing.",111116421.0,BINGAMAN,JEFF,S,NM,M,D,,voting,S,2009-03-26,468,Mr. BINGAMAN,Unknown,BINGAMAN,Unknown,M,29639,29713,03262009.txt,2648,407,111,2009,rise financ baucu discuss recoveri reinvest arra establish new credit known c credit invest advanc energi facil pleas arra establish new credit invest credit renew energi technolog concentr downstream commerci individu consum level incent us job instal advanc energi technolog instal continu manufactur oversea driver oversea manufactur signific incent instanc malaysia solar photovolta manufactur incom holiday case malaysia germani percent invest result us far behind fall behind clean tech manufactur japan repres percent global solar cell product percent european manufactur percent global wind compon market us ground advanc energi manufactur anticip rapid midterm growth domest renew energi technolog driven factor includ last extens commerci residenti invest credit extens arra product credit wind product anticip nation renew electr deploy anticip marketbas limit carbon emiss quo growth domest larg satisfi import work baucu establish arra first credit invest advanc energi facil manufactur har renew gener energi make energi effici improv greenhous emiss baucu share path leader advanc energi manufactur,233,0.352112676056338,0.2391304347826087
1110007045,One of the things we have to be particularly proud of in this stimulus package today. first of all. for every $1 billion we are spending on infrastructure. we are creating 40.000 jobs. so we did a very good job with that today. But we are also investing in programs that create jobs that also are needed and necessary in our country. We talked about the crumbling bridges and the infrastructure of the sewer pipes and all of that. but when we talk about the energy program. we have been supporting. as progressives. we have been supporting at least an Apollosize energy program that not only provides jobs but will help us with our security so that we are not dependent on foreign fuels. Actually. green technology is jobs for the future.

1100182107,"Mr. Speaker. ocean acidification is both the most disturbing and potentially the most unifying issue involving carbon dioxide and climate change. It is the most disturbing because nothing that I have heard in the last couple of years about this phenomenon disproves the point of that old saying from the 1960s that was in an old commercial ""Its not nice to fool with Mother Nature."" And we have found that when we put onethird of all the carbon dioxide coming out of our tailpipes and our coal plants. that that has made the oceans. just since the industrial revolution. 30 percent more acidic. and all the time the world has been around. it is 30 percent more acidic just during the time weve been burning coal and oil. The results of that are not hypothetical. We had testimony in Seattle from biologists and oceanographers a couple months ago that said they actually put a shell into water that was as acidic as it could be in the next century and a half and you could see it literally melt. You are looking at literally melting of any living stuff in the oceans that form a calcium carbonate material. including the phytoplankton that is 40 percent of the bottom of the food chain. in the next century or two if we dont change course. Thats why its disturbing. But here is why its unifying: Its unifying because while we have had some debates about the climatic effects about global warming and C02. there is no debate about ocean acidification. We could spent the next century arguing about the precise climatic effects of C02. but there is no debate that we are making the oceans unfit for life that God -himself or herself designed on the planet Earth. And that is what we are doing. And I am hopeful that that can be a unifying idea in this Congress so that we can start to develop a clean energy future for the country and the world that can preserve the oceans for living species that we depend on as well as the rest of the world. So it is disturbing now. Hopefully. it will be unifying when we get together and really do an Apollo new energy project and save the oceans for what they were designed for. which is life on this planet.",110116310.0,INSLEE,JAY,H,WA,M,D,1.0,voting,H,2008-07-09,482,Mr. INSLEE,Unknown,INSLEE,Unknown,M,23103,23164,07092008.txt,2144,392,110,2008,ocean acidif potenti unifi issu carbon dioxid climat heard last phenomenon disprov point old old commerci nice fool mother natur found carbon dioxid come tailpip coal plant ocean sinc industri revolut percent acid world around percent acid weve burn coal result seattl biologist oceanograph month ago said shell water acid could next centuri half could see liter melt look liter melt stuff ocean calcium carbon includ phytoplankton percent bottom food chain next centuri two dont cours that unifi unifi climat effect global warm c ocean acidif could next centuri argu precis climat effect c make ocean unfit life planet earth unifi idea develop clean energi futur world preserv ocean speci depend well rest world unifi get togeth realli apollo new energi project ocean life planet,166,0.24786324786324787,0.23863636363636365

1110030705,Mr. President. as ranking memberof the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. and as a longstanding steward of the environment. I have continuously requested increased funding for the EnvirOnmental Protection Agencys Energy Star for Small Business Program. which has documented how voluntary action by small business owners can reduce energy costs by 30 percent or more. The SnoweLandrieu amendment would require that a minimum of 2 percent of the EPAs Energy Star Programs total budget be allocated to the Energy Star for Small Business Program. This critical program provides free unbiased information and technical support for small businesses to improve their companys financial performance by reducing energy waste and energy costs. while protecting the Earths environment. Regrettably. in the past. less than 2 percent of Energy Stars annual funding has been allocated to the Small Business program which is responsible for reaching the entire small business community. thereby restricting its tremendous potential impact. This inadequate percentage grossly underestimates the critical role small businesses can play in improving our Nations energy efficiency and reducing our carbon footprint. Through efforts to increase energy efficiency. small businesses can contribute to Americas energy security. help to combat global warming. while strengthening their competitive advantage all at the same time. With 27 million small businesses in the U.S. comprising 99.7 percent of all domestic employer firms and producing approximately half of all the commercial and industrial energy in the United States. the role small businesses can play in forging a solution to global climate change and rising energy prices is undeniable. This amendment would provide small businesses with the funding. technical assistance. and resources necessary to improve small business energy efficiency. Every effort must be made at the Federal level to ensure the connection small businesses can engage in clean and renewable energy.

1110032881,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. my amendment ensures that potential water storage reservoirs and their hydropower resources are kept on the table when it comes to our Nations future water and power supplies. I have the privilege of representing a rural district in central Washington. Constituents in my district and throughout the Pacific Northwest have benefited tremendously from the emissionsfree and renewable hydropower generated from water reservoirs in the Columbia River Basin. In fact. over 80 percent of Washington States electricity needs are met through hydropower. Water reservoirs. such as Lake Roosevelt behind Grand Coulee Dam and the reservoirs behind the Snake River Dam have not only provided muchneeded hydroelectricity. but also deliver water for irrigation. barge transportation. drinking water. flood control and recreation purposes. Many of our Nations water storage reservoirs contribute to the generation of hydropower. which is.. Mr. Chairman. a renewable and clean energy resource. Hydropower projects have provided emissionsfree electricity for generations. Recent debate here in Washington. D.C. has been focused on global climate policies and how wind and solar can be energy solutions for the future. I agree that these technologies should be part of oiir energy portfolio. but our country needs an alloftheabove approach to meet our needs. We need wind. solar. hydro. oil. natural gas and nuclear power. However. we must recognize that the wind doesnt blow all the time and that it gets dark at night. In my region of the Pacific Northwest. hydropower is the renewable backup resource for wind power. When the wind subsides. hydropower generation is increased to offset the loss of wind power. Without hydropower. wind generation would not be the reality that it is today. Yet some do not recognize that hydropower is a renewable resource and fail to see the need for new water storage reservoirs that help develop and foster these and other renewable energies. reservoirs that have helped develop our Nation and will continue to provide multiple uses. including hydropower. There is simply no reason why we should discount potential new water storage and reservoirs in the future. So to that end. Mr. Chairman. my amendment directs the relevant agencies to assess potential water storage projects that would enhance water supply. water planning and other beneficial uses. While I pointed out the benefits of hydropower. this amendment does not predetermine outcomes. It simply puts potential water storage as a consideration when looking at our entire water supply outlook. Whether it is for drinking water. irrigation or for power generation. it puts that on the table. So I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.,111117640.0,HASTINGS,DOC,H,WA,M,R,4.0,voting,H,2009-04-23,88,Mr. HASTINGS of Washington,Unknown,HASTINGS,Washington,M,3258,3342,04232009.txt,2855,448,111,2009,consum ensur potenti water storag reservoir hydropow kept come nation futur water suppli repres central pacif northwest benefit tremend emissionsfre renew hydropow gener water reservoir river basin fact percent electr need hydropow water reservoir lake roosevelt behind coule dam reservoir behind snake river dam provid muchneed hydroelectr also water barg drink water flood control recreat purpos nation water storag reservoir contribut gener hydropow renew clean energi hydropow project provid emissionsfre electr gener focus global climat polici wind solar energi solut futur agre technolog part oiir energi portfolio need alloftheabov approach meet need need wind solar hydro natur nuclear recogn wind doesnt blow get dark night region pacif northwest hydropow renew backup wind wind subsid hydropow gener increas offset loss wind without hydropow wind gener realiti recogn hydropow renew fail see need new water storag reservoir help develop foster renew energi reservoir help develop nation continu provid includ hydropow simpli discount potenti new water storag reservoir futur direct relev assess potenti water storag project enhanc water suppli water plan benefici point benefit hydropow predetermin simpli potenti water storag consider look entir water suppli outlook whether drink water gener commonsens reserv balanc,262,0.2953020134228188,0.23809523809523808
1100146283,Mr. President. the CollinsLevin energy independence amendment will help set us on a path toward energy independence and provide a more sensible energy tax policy. The CollinsLevin energy independence amendment to the budget resolution specifies that legislation under the reserve fund for investing in clean energy. preserving the environment. and providing for certain settlements may also include tax credits for the following: Our amendment expands energy tax credits to encourage replacement of old wood stoves with clean burning. more efficient stoves. Unfortunately. many of the wood stoves purchased decades ago are outdated. inefficient. and are contributing to both indoor and outdoor air pollution. The emissions from these old wood burning stoves present a serious health concern. contributing to such respiratory ailments as asthma and bronchitis. New. EPAcertified wood and *wood pellet stoves can cut emissions by more than 70 percent and use as much as a third less firewood for the same amount of heat. The production of ethanol from cellulosic sources and production of biodiesel fuels. These technologies each offer tremendous potential for reductions in our gasoline consumption and in greenhouse gas emissions and will help move our petroleumbased economy toward a renewable. sustainable forest bioeconomy. The purchase of. plugin hybrid electric drive vehicles. The combination of advanced battery technology and advanced hybrid systems offer tremendous potential for reduction of oil consumption. but tax incentives will be necessary to offset the increased cost to consumers and to achieve widespread acceptance by consumers. It is estimated that a plugin hybrid could get the equivalent of 100 MPG. having a large impact on reducing our use of oil. We would pay for these by scaling back a tax preference for large oil companies which their executives have testified they do not need. The amendment also specifies that legislation under this reserve fund may include adjustments to the amortization of geological and geophysical expenditures by integrated oil companies to help pay for the. tax incentives. In 2005. the major oil companies have conceded that they do not need this tax break. Adjustments to this tax break could provide billions over 5 years. There is no reason to provide reduced tax rates for one of the worlds most profitable industries at a time when so many families and small businesses are struggling and when we need to address the longterm challenge of reducing our reliance on imported oil.,110118301.0,COLLINS,SUSAN,S,ME,F,R,,voting,S,2008-03-13,1447,Ms. COLLINS,Unknown,COLLINS,Unknown,F,39833,39916,03132008.txt,2540,395,110,2008,collinslevin energi independ help us path toward energi independ provid sensibl energi polici collinslevin energi independ reserv fund invest clean energi preserv environ provid certain settlement also includ credit expand energi credit encourag old wood stove clean burn effici stove unfortun wood stove purchas decad ago outdat ineffici contribut indoor outdoor air pollut emiss old wood burn stove seriou health concern contribut respiratori ailment asthma bronchiti new epacertifi wood wood pellet stove cut emiss percent firewood amount heat product ethanol cellulos sourc product biodiesel fuel technolog tremend potenti gasolin consumpt greenhous emiss help move petroleumbas economi toward renew forest bioeconomi purchas plugin hybrid electr drive vehicl combin advanc batteri technolog advanc hybrid tremend potenti consumpt incent necessari offset increas consum achiev widespread consum estim plugin hybrid could get equival mpg larg impact pay scale back prefer larg compani execut need also reserv fund includ adjust amort geolog geophys expenditur integr compani help pay incent compani conced need break adjust break could provid billion provid rate world profit industri famili small struggl need longterm challeng relianc import,237,0.22784810126582278,0.23770491803278687
1100138977,Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 5351. the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of 2008. I commend the Speaker and the Ways and Means committee for their tireless efforts on behalf of this important legislation. We are at a crucial point in the United States in the development of our alternative energy economy. We are at a point where. without our support. these industries could either grow and prosper or be sent overseas. This bill represents an important step to ensure that alternative energy technologies like windmills and fuel cells are manufactured in Connecticut. not China and in Indiana. not India. Tax credits for alternative energy technologies are crucial to these industries across the United States. and particularly in Connecticut. Connecticut has become a leader in the atemative energy field. particularly in the area of fuel cell technology. We have succeeded as a result of investment in research and development. partnerships between the industry and the state and federal government and the ingenuity and talented workforce in the state. The impact of the fuel cell industry on Connecticuts economy has been powerful. The Connecticut fuel cell industry has created over 2.000 jobs statewide and generates $29 million in tax revenues to the state annually. The Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of 2008 strengthens and extends the tax credits for investment in fuel cell technology for 8 years. providing much needed certainty to the industry. It also extends the production tax credit for altemative energy technologies like wind. solar and geothermal energy. In a recent New York Times article. a reporter traveled to small towns in Texas that people had all but given up on because of their faltering economies. These same towns are now experiencing a rebirth because the wind industry is bringing jobs back to their community. This is the impact this important legislation can have on towns throughout the Nation and why I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5351.,110120160.0,LARSON,JOHN,H,CT,M,D,1.0,voting,H,2008-02-27,183,Mr. LARSON of Connecticut,Unknown,LARSON,Connecticut,M,10852,10902,02272008.txt,2033,330,110,2008,rise hr renew energi energi conserv commend way mean tireless effort behalf import crucial point develop energi economi point without industri could either grow prosper oversea repres import ensur energi technolog like windmil fuel cell manufactur china india credit energi technolog crucial industri particularli becom leader atem energi field particularli area fuel cell technolog succeed result invest research develop partnership industri ingenu talent workforc impact fuel cell industri economi fuel cell industri job statewid gener million annual renew energi energi conserv strengthen extend credit invest fuel cell technolog provid need certainti industri also extend product credit altem energi technolog like wind solar geotherm energi new report travel small town peopl given falter economi town experienc rebirth wind industri bring job back commun impact import town nation rise strong hr,181,0.2727272727272727,0.2375

Virginia. Red Birch Energy converts the oil from crushed canola seeds grown by local farmers into a cleanburning. efficient biodiesel fuel that is less efficient than ordinary diesel fuel. Canola provides a great seed for biodiesel production. since the seeds 44 percent oil content is higher than that of soybeans and corn. yet not affecting food prices.

1100166026,"Reclaiming my time. so your point is very well made. You cant ignore the fact that we need to continue to rely on fossil fuels as we transition. And we must actually do what the United States Army told us to do in 1945. in a book they published on May 1. 1945. when they told us that it was necessary for this Nation to diversify away from our use of fossil fuels. And they told us how. And much of what they said then and much of what I believe our committees have said and what I believe this country is doing. and even the businesses. certainly like the smart people like T. Boone Pickens. who are looking at these diverse activities that we should be involved with that will give us new sources of energy. We include in the legislation that were talking about tonight significant funding for ARPAE. which is advance research projects. And we talk about wind. solar. weatherization efficiencies. marine/hydrokinetic energy research. industrial energy efficiency. We have already passed many of these pieces of legislation as authorizing. and now were looking for funding for it. Building energy efficiency. energy storage. batteries. We"" must find new ways to hold much of the energy that we are creating regardless of the manner in which we are creating the electricity to do it.

1100181611,Madam Speaker. I rise today to introduce the Energy Efficient and Environmentally Friendly Automobile Tax Credit Act. legislation that will help Americans reduce pollution and the amount they pay for gas. My legislation accomplishes these important goals by providing Americans a tax credit of up to $2.000 when they sell or trade in a car and obtain a vehicle that has at least a 20 percent higher average fuel economy than the sold or tradedin car.. The bill also creates a Federal tax deduction for any State or local taxes paid on the purchase of the more fuelefficient automobile and makes interest on loans to purchase the more fuelefficient automobile tax deductible. This legislation will help Americans cope with high gas prices by making it easier for them to obtain more fuelefficient cars. I hope my colleagues would agree that Congress should provide free market incentives to make it easier for Americans to exchange their current cars for cars that create less pollution. Providing tax deductions and tax credits to make it easier for Americans to purchase fuelefficient automobiles is a win for American consumers. a win for the environment. and a win for those of us who favor free market solutions to pollution and high gas prices. urge my colleagues to support this legislation.,,,,,,,,,,E,2008-07-08,655,Mr. PAUL,Unknown,PAUL,Unknown,M,36620,36649,07082008.txt,1297,215,110,2008,rise introduc energi effici environment friendli automobil credit help pollut amount pay import goal provid credit sell trade car vehicl least percent higher averag fuel economi sold tradedin car also deduct local purchas fueleffici automobil make interest loan purchas fueleffici automobil deduct help cope high price make easier fueleffici car agre provid free market incent make easier exchang current car car pollut provid deduct credit make easier purchas fueleffici automobil win consum win environ win us favor free market solut pollut high price,125,0.3108108108108108,0.23529411764705882

1100168800,Mr. Speaker. since 2006 the Democrats have been completely in control of Congress. The Democrat leadership continues to put a roadblock in the way of accessing American oil. Gas prices have doubled in the past year. At the station down the street from my home. gas is now over $4 a gallon. House Republicans believe in increasing production of Americanmade energy. Vast untapped American energy resources are currently under lock and key and offlimits. American energy resources can make our Nation more secure and less dependent on foreign oil. House Republicans believe not only in technologies like wind. solar. and biomass but that we ought to make use of the billions of barrels of oil in Alaska. off the deep waters of the Outer Continental Shelf. and on Federal lands. We can do this in an environmentally sensitive way. And we should eliminate the red tape it takes to build a new oil refinery.

1100143896,Thank you. I appreciate the gentleladys courtesy. It is a little frustrating to listen to our friends repudiate the legacy of Ronald Reagan and Dick Darman who believed in the PAYGO philosophy. These people feel that they cannot balance revenue and spending. and they dont even want to try. We heard them in our committee propose adjustments that would have added over $1 trillion to the deficit. This budget demonstrates the Democratic commitment to the environment. public health and livable communities in a fiscally sustainable fashion. This budget addresses the 7 years of cutting environmental programs and failing to address our energy needs and challenges of this country. We reject the Presidents cuts to these programs and begin to reinvest in our public lands and domestic economy. This Presidents budget severely cuts important core environmental programs at a time when a third of our Nations waters dont meet water quality standards and 150 million people live in areas that exceed EPAs air pollution standards. And the Presidents budget would provide some of the lowest levels of funding for clean water and drinking water revolving funds in their history. hurting communities ability to meet their water infrastructure needs. which the EPA of the administration has estimated to be over a quarter of a billion dollars. Finally. the Presidents budget cuts the USDA farm bill conservation programs which provide farmers with critical technical and financial assistance to reduce erosion. protect wildlife habitat and limit adverse impacts from agriculture on land and water. Our budget rejects those cuts to natural resources environmental program. This provides 10 percent more to discretionary funding than the Presidents budget. On the environment. over 5 years the chairmans mark is more than $26 billion higher than the Presidents budget. This budget accommodates the legislation that the House has passed three times to increase tax incentives for renewable energy and conservation. It rejects the Presidents cuts to research as well as weatherization assistance for lowincome families to cut down on energy bills. Instead. this bill increases funding for energy efficient and renewable energy programs and vehicle technologies that move our economies forward.,110118640.0,BLUMENAUER,EARL,H,OR,M,D,3.0,voting,H,2008-03-12,208,Mr. BLUMENAUER,Unknown,BLUMENAUER,Unknown,M,9479,9557,03122008.txt,2280,353,110,2008,frustrat repudi legaci ronald reagan dick darman believ paygo philosophi peopl feel balanc spend dont even want tri heard propos adjust trillion deficit demonstr environ health livabl commun fiscal fashion cut environment program fail energi need challeng cut program reinvest land domest economi cut import core environment program nation water dont meet water qualiti standard million peopl area exceed epa air pollut standard provid lowest level fund clean water drink water revolv fund histori hurt commun meet water infrastructur need epa estim billion final cut usda farm conserv program provid farmer financi assist eros wildlif habitat limit advers impact agricultur land water cut natur environment program provid percent discretionari fund environ billion higher three increas incent renew energi conserv cut research well weather assist lowincom famili cut energi instead increas fund energi effici renew energi program vehicl technolog move economi,207,0.30985915492957744,0.23469387755102042
1100168464,Madam Speaker. I rise today in support of Taiwans proposed membership in the World Health Organization. WHO. In todays global community. health is a shared responsibility. as the whole world is vulnerable to transnational diseases. Given the tremendous volume of international travel and global trade. the transmission of communicable diseases between borders has been heightened. This reality necessitates both global collaboration and a global response to prevent and control the spread of these diseases. The World Health Organization is the organization tasked with this duty. It is responsible for providing leadership on global health matters. shaping the health research agenda. setting norms and standards. articulating evidencebased policy options. providing technical support to countries and monitoring and assessing health Irends. Currently. there are over 190 participants in the WHO. Taiwan is not one of them. however. which means that the 23 million citizens of Taiwan do not have access to the critical health service and information the WHO provides. As a strong democracy and one of the worlds most robust economics. Taiwan should be allowed to benefit from the health services and medical protections offered by the WHO. including direct and immediate access to uptodate disease information. Taiwans exclusion from the WHO also prevents the country from taking part in the WHO mechanism for the allocation of vaccines and other disease control supplies. Taiwans inability to make use of these allocation mechanisms during international outbreaks hampers its disease control efforts and has a strong negative impact on the health of the people in Taiwan. Taiwans membership in the WHO is not only in the interest of the people of Taiwan. it is in the interest of the international community and the WHO itself: as the WHO stands to benefit significantly from the financial and SSIONAL RECORD - Extensions o technological contributions that Taiwan has to offer.

1100157446,Madam Speaker. Fifty years ago today. the Southeastern Colorado Water Conservancy District was formed by a district court in Pueblo. Colorado. Its charge was to develop and administer the FryingpanArkansas Project. My Congressional District includes the Lower Arkansas Valley. which both the Project and the District serve.

The Arkansas Valley is not a wealthy region. but its people are rich in their determination and their love for the Valley.

1100148420,"I want to thank the gentleman for yielding. and the generosity of his time. Mr. Chairman. in this decade. wildland fires have consumed 50 million acres in this country: While the term ""wildland fires"" brings to mind uninhabited areas in our Nations parks. forests. and rural areas. wildland fires have done tremendous damage to urban and suburban developmentas well. I think that was the reason for the colloquy between Mr. Wu from Oregon and Mr. SALI from Idaho. Last fall. western States were hit particularly hard by wildland fires that encroached into developed areas and destroyed homes. businesses. and livelihoods. The amendment offered by the gentleman from Idaho addresses that concern. The amendment allows the Administrator of the USFA to distribute information on the importance of clearing in these areas biomass materials from Federal lands. not out in the interior of a National Park. That was a point that was made in the colloquy. The amendment requires USFA to work in consultation. of course. with other Federal agencies to ensure that USFA provides the best possible recommendations.

1110023704,Madam Speaker. I rise today to introduce legislation to authorize extension of Metrorails Orange. Yellow. Blue. and Purple lines. I appreciate Mr. JIM MORANS cosponsorship of this legislation. I represent a district with the fourth worst congestion in the country. These traffic conditions diminish the economic productivity of our region while contributing to climate change. While the local Board of Supervisors has worked to transform land use patterns in order to focus development around Metro stations. we only have five Metro stations in Fairfax County and thus have limited capacity to encourage Transit Oriented Development. In Prince .William County. there are no Metrorail stations. and my constituents in Prince William must confront congestion neariy every day on their way !o work. Fortunately. both Prince William and Fairfax County are served by the Virginia Railway Express. This commuter rail service is filled to capacity on a daily basis. as is the Metrorail system in Northern Virginia. suggesting a pressing need to expand transit service. The Metrorail extensions that I have proposed would enhance transit service in the 1495. 195. and 166 corridors. Residents of Centreville. Lorton. Woodbridge. and other communities that currently lack Metrorail access would have the option to commute on Metro. which would enhance the quality of life of my constituents while stabilizing housing values and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. During the present economic crisis. homes in Northern Virginia that are located near transit have maintained their value relative to homes only served by highways. For the sake of communities that are threatened by extremely high rates of foreclosure. extension of transit service can be a force for economic revitalization. This proposed extension of transit service is consistent with local government policies. For example. the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors supports extension of Metrorail in the 166 corridor and in the 195 corridor. This legislation is crafted to give local governments flexibility in locating the stations and determining what type of rail infrastructure to construct. This flexibility is essential to ensure that these transit extensions reflect the needs of Northern Virginia residents and to ensure that we maximize the eoonomic development potential inherent in these Metrorail extensions. I am proud to offer this legislation that may create the opportunity for our local. state. and federal levels of government to collaborate on extension of transit service. This legislation is essential for the long term vitality of Northern Virginias economy. neighborhoods. and environment.

1110060748,Mr. Chair. I rise today to express may support for the Advanced Vehicle Technology Act . I thank Chairman GORDON and the members of the Science and Technology Committee for their work on this important legislation. which will fuel innovation in the American automobile sector and capitalize on Americas manufacturing infrastructure to spur the creation of millions of wellpaying American jobs and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. Our countrys approach to developing advanced technology vehicles must be comprehensive and coordinated to ensure innovation and advancement in our entire vehicle fleet. Historically. the Vehicle Technologies program at the U.S. Department of Energy has lacked a comprehensive approach to research and development. with various technologies competing for funding and imbalanced investment in between passenger and heavy duty vehicles research. The Advanced Vehicle Technology Act addresses these issues through authorization of longterm. sustained funding for a new comprehensive research and development program at the Department of Energy. H.R. 3246 invests in a diverse range of nearterm and longrange vehicle technologies that will improve fuel efficiency. support domestic research and manufacturing. and reduce our countrys dependence on petroleum that pollutes our planet and keeps us dependent on foreign energy sources. Such a comprehensive approach will fuel American innovation now and into the future. Innovation is Americas greatest strength. As our country recovers from a serious recession. funding for research and development is one of the best investments we can make to restore our American leadership in the global economy. America excels at high tech manufacturing. and investing in the development of a new generation of advanced technology vehicles will drive the creation of millions of new. well paying manufacturing jobs here at home. Innovation in vehicle technologies is also an important component in addressing the pressing challenge of global climate change. Americas passenger and commercial transport sector produces one third of our countrys total carbon dioxide emissions. Meeting the challenge of global climate change will require the development of a new generation of vehicles powered with clean energy. Modernizing our nations vehicle fleet through American innovation is critical for our economic prosperity. energy security. and responsible stewardship of our planet.

1110034370,Mr. Speaker. this Congress is committed to energy selfsufficiency as a matter of national security. Hawaiis situation is especially acute as Hawaii is the most oil dependent State in the country and has the highest fuel and electricity costs nationwide. Thus. Hawaii is particularly aware of the need to change the status quo and focus on achieving a clean energy economy. Recently enacted legislation has given consumers and businesses in Hawaii and across the country incentives to invest in clean and renewable technologies. and more will be accomplished through the American Clean Energy and Security Act on which we are working. Our actions result in real decisions by real businesses. For example. because we extended the solar tax credits. a solar panel company and a local business in Hawaii got together to install photovoltaic panels on the roof of the business. which now generates 95 percent of its electricity from these panels. Our work on the American Clean Energy and Security Act will help States like Hawaii reach our energy goals.,111119800.0,HIRONO,MAZIE,H,HI,F,D,2.0,voting,H,2009-04-28,202,Ms. HIRONO,Unknown,HIRONO,Unknown,F,17426,17456,04282009.txt,1049,171,111,2009,energi selfsuffici nation situat especi acut depend highest fuel electr nationwid particularli awar need quo focu achiev clean energi economi given consum incent invest clean renew technolog clean energi work result real decis real exampl extend solar credit solar panel compani local got togeth instal photovolta panel roof gener percent electr panel work clean energi help like reach energi goal,98,0.3380281690140845,0.23404255319148937

1110026686,"Madam Speaker. even though the alarmist global warming crowd claim humans are the evil CO2 pollutants of earth. the jury is still out on the theory of global warming. At a recent meeting of the International Conference on Climate Change. as reported by the Heritage Foundation. 31.072 American scientists subscribe to this statement: ""There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide. methane. or other greenhouse gases is causing or will. in the foreseeable future. cause catastrophic heating of* the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate."" Madam Speaker. how can this be? Were all told that global warming is a fact. and dont even argue this issue. Even though global warming is still a theory. it hasnt stopped the Federal Government from presuming it to be an absolute fact. and it now has an energy policy based upon the global warming theory. It proposes an energy consumption tax called the capandtrade. or the cap and tax on all Americans and all businesses that use any form of energy. Heres the plan. Every person and business that uses energy will be taxed for the use of that energy. For example. if a homeowner turns on the lights in their home. they will be taxed for the use of the electricity in that house. If a person wants hot water in their house and they turn on the hot water. coming from the hot water heater thats usually heated by natural gas. theyll be taxed for that use of that hot water because theyre using the energy of natural gas. If you turn on the furnace in the winter in the Northeast. youll be taxed because youre using home heating oil. All of these taxes are called the capandtrade. or capandtax. as I call them. What this means is that it will increase the taxes of individual homeowners in this country. about 50 percent a year. And of course. it will raise taxes on businesses. Businesses. as they normally do. will send that tax on down to the consumer. and the consumer will have to pay for that tax. How much are we talking about? Individuals will have to pay an additional $1.800 a year for this new energy tax. this new capandtax that will be placed on Americans. Madam Speaker. Americans dont need or want any more taxes for any reason. Supposedly. this moneys going to be used to subsidize green energy products. Now were learning that socalled renewable energy may be more expensive than the use of nuclear power and fossil energy. Madam Speaker. remember how we were all told that ethanol was going to save us all. how its not going to pollute like crude oil. how its going to be cheap renewable energy? Now were learning something opposite. We learned that it costs too much to produce ethanol without a Federal subsidy. It caused a food shortage not only in the United States but throughout the world. because we had the idea that we should burn corn for energy. And we also learned that ethanol was. in fact. a pollutant. Now people dont talk so much about the benefits of ethanol. although the Federal Government has spent millions and millions of dollars with the ethanol program. Madam Speaker. no question about it. We need to explore all types of energy. solar. hydrogen. wind and nuclear. But we should also use the resources we have. like clean coal and crude. We need them to provide energy for Americans. Madam Speaker. Americas the only country that doesnt use its own natural resources for its energy. and that includes the fact that we should drill offshore because that will bring jobs to America. It will keep money in America. instead of going overseas. And that lease revenue that the oil companies pay will go to the Federal Treasury. We need to do all of the above until we can move to alternative energy.

1110034071,Thank you. Madam Chair. I just want to say. Mr. Speaker. that our chairwoman has been so very supportive of this hour and of me continuing to be the anchor. But I also want to say to our chairwoman that I appreciate your kind of setting the record straight because I know that one of the things that our President talked about is. his priorities were edu-. cation. health care. and energy. And he didnt say any of it would happen overnight. contrary to what our colleagues across the aisle said. that they thought it was going to happen right away. As a matter of fact. the President said it would take time. So I do thank you for helping me set the record straight. and I thank you for being here this evening. Thank you. Madam Chair. Mr. Speaker. reliable predictions indicate that by the year 2050. the worlds population will have nearly doubled from its present level. It will rise from around 6 billion to about 10 billion people. Most of this growth and much of the increase in energy consumption will occur in developing countries. Future increases in energy demand will exert even greater pressure on our finite reserves. If we are largely dependent on one fuel source. we risk price rises and supply disruptions. It is imperative for us to use our energy more efficiently and develop an energy supply that is both sustainable and diverse in order to improve our quality of life and protect our environment. As a country. we can no longer depend on the cheap conception of gas and other finite resources. It is in the interest of our national security to become independent from our foreign sources of oil in politically unstable regions of the world. If we continue to invest in other finite resources. what is to prevent those costs -from skyrocketing when the supply runs low? If we dont invest in renewable technologies now. we could be on the brink of a catastrophe. not to mention the health and environmental cost. The best way to lower energy costs is to make homes. buildings. vehicles. and infrastructure more energy efficient. In the process. we create jobs. Doing nothing to curb carbon pollution means rising surface temperatures. rising sea levels. adverse health effects. and displaced populations. The longer we delay. the higher the cost. As global warming becomes more threatening. addressing the future of Americas environment becomes increaaingly urgent. According to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on- Climate Change. the average global temperature could rise by an additional 2.5 to 10.5 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100. If the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere doubles as expected. the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has acknowledged that without emission control policies. the amount of carbon monoxide in the air will far exceed todays levels with a 30 to 150 percent increase. According to an assessment by the World Health Organization of possible health impacts of climate change. more than 150.000 deaths may have been caused in the year 2000 alone by global warming as a result of disease. malnutrition. and loss of shelter. This negative impact on world health will only increase as the climate changes. Experts predict that onefourth of the Earths species will be headed for extinction by 2050 if the warming trend continues at its current rate. More than $100 billion worth of homes. businesses. and public facilities are at risk from extreme coastal storms if sea levels rise as anticipated. When we invest in renewable energies. we are not only creating jobs and strengthening our economic prospects for the future. we are protecting our increasingly more fragile -environment as well. The Congressional Black Caucus recommends that we support sciencebased legislation to reduce domestic greenhouse gas emissions at least 80 percent below 1990 levels by the year 2050. The United States must be a leader on this global issue. and this target is consistent with the proposals Of the Obama administration. Any public investment in the green economy should include serious efforts to train. employ and provide public service opportunities that lead to fulltime employment in these industries. We must develop a career pipeline. particularly in low- and middleincome communities. through training. job readiness. and entrepreneurship programs to ensure that people who most need work are prepared for the familysustaining jobs and careers in energy efficiency and energy service industries. When we talk about consumer protection. we have heard a lot about capandtrade. And sometimes I agree and sometimes I disagree with all of the things that are out there. but let me just say two things about capandtrade. A capandtrade system must be fair and must not be to the detriment of manufacturers and businesses. A capandtrade system will increase the cost of energy derived from highpolluting production processes for all households. Low- and middleincome households spend a greater share of their budget on energy costs than higher income households. To help prevent climate change policies from being unfairly burdensome on these households. we must remember to promote and support vital projects such as.the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. better known as LIHEAP.

1110000413,Madam Speaker. today I introduce a bill to reauthorize and expand -Rob Portmans landmark legislation. the Tropical Forest Conservation Act. This reauthorization will help developing countries reduce foreign debt and provide. comprehensive environmental preservation programs to protect forests and endangered marine habitats around the world. Since enacted in 1998. Tropical Forest Conservation Act programs have generated more than $162 million over 10 to 25 years to help conserve 50 million acres of tropical forests in Asia. the Caribbean. Central and South America. But the rate of deforestation continues to accelerate across the globe in all types of forests. Similarly alarming is the rapid rate of coral reef and coastal exploitation. The burden of foreign debt falls especially hard on the smallest of nations. such as island nations in the Caribbean and Pacific. With few natural resources. these nations often resort to harvesting or otherwise exploiting coral reefs and other marine habitats to earn hard currency to service foreign debt. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 60 percent of the worlds coral reefs may be destroyed by the year 2050 if the present rate of destruction continues. The Forest and Coral Conservation Act will credit qualified developing nations for each dollar spent on a comprehensive reef preservation or management program designed to protect these unique ecosystems from degradation. This legislation will make available resources for environmental stewardship that would otherwise be of the lowest priority in a developing country. It will reduce debt by investing locally in programs that will strengthen indigenous economies by creating longterm management policies that will preserve the natural resources upon which local commerce is based. This legislation has enormous consequences for the existence of critical ecosystems. the health of our planet and the livelihoods of millions of people across the globe.

That is all domestic discretionary spending is increasedby 5.3 percent. It averages nondefense discretionary spending at a 22percent increase over the 5 years. The McCain offer and the chairmans mark are almost identical with respect to deficit levels and debt levels.

It also means hindering Americas dependence on foreign oil. which has a direct impact. of course. on the price of gasoline. Last summer. Congress heard from Americans. and I heard from countless Kentuckians. demanding a balanced approach to our energy problem that includes boosting American energy production as well as conserving what we already have.

Im telling you youve got to ensure that the entrepreneurs and the innovators know that their cuttingedge breakthroughs and innovations are protected. This isnt even as much about fair return for the inventors as it is ensuring that people will- keep innovating and researching and advancing the technologies because they know that ultimately they .will be compensated. So its a symbiotic relationship. The more we ensure and protect itellectual property. the more we will be able to do in achieving our very important goals with respect to the development and deployment of new energy and environmental technologies.

1100180598,Mr. President. I rise today to introduce. on behalf of myself and Senators SESSIONS. MURKOWSKI. and LANDRIEU. a bill that establishes the foundation for a sustainable nuclear fuel cycle for the U.S. A sustainable nuclear fuel cycle is the key to nuclear energy reaching its full potential to provide the large scale base load electrical generating capacity our country needs. while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Today. nuclear energy provides nearly 20 percent of our electricity generation capacity and does so more reliably. and with a lower cost per kilowatt hour than coal. with essentially no greenhouse gas emissions. In the decades to come. we will need nuclear energy to play an even greater role. not only in electrical generation. but also in the transportation and industrial sectors. if we are to achieve the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions needed to address the challenge of global climate change. The Strengthening Management of Advanced Recycling Technologies Act. or SMART Act. represents the first important step in building the bridge to that future.,110113601.0,DOMENICI,PETE,S,NM,M,R,,voting,S,2008-06-26,938,Mr. DOMENICI,Unknown,DOMENICI,Unknown,M,53662,53691,06262008.txt,1080,170,110,2008,rise introduc behalf landrieu establish foundat nuclear fuel cycl us nuclear fuel cycl key nuclear energi reach full potenti provid larg scale load electr gener capac need greenhous emiss nuclear energi provid nearli percent electr gener capac reliabl lower per kilowatt coal greenhous emiss decad come need nuclear energi play even greater role electr gener also industri sector achiev greenhous emiss need challeng global climat strengthen advanc recycl technolog smart repres first import build bridg futur,103,0.28205128205128205,0.23214285714285715
1110053864,Science tells us we must begin to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions in the next 5 to 10 years. But according to an analysis by offsets expert and Stanford law professor Michael Wara. it is possible that wecould see no reduction of CO2 emissions until the year 2040 because of offsets and unlimited banking of allowances in the new energy and environment bill. The bill allows 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide a year. roughly equivalent to 30 percent of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Supporters of the bill point out that coal use will increase by 2020 because electric utilities will continue. to use dirty coal. the prime source of pollution. With 2 billion tons of offsets per year. we are told that electric utilities will reduce carbon emissions at places other than their generating plants so they really dont have to actually decrease their emissions. and -coalfired CO2 emissions will increase through 2025. No wonder there are 26 active coal plant applications. Increased CO2 emissions will be our gift to the next generation? Apparently the planet is not melting. With this bill. it is just getting betterfor polluters.,111116900.0,KUCINICH,DENNIS,H,OH,M,D,10.0,voting,H,2009-06-24,227,Mr. KUCINICH,Unknown,KUCINICH,Unknown,M,16672,16703,06242009.txt,1138,190,111,2009,scienc us global greenhous emiss next analysi offset expert stanford professor michael wara possibl wecould see co emiss offset unlimit bank allow new energi environ allow billion ton carbon dioxid roughli equival percent us greenhous emiss point coal increas electr continu dirti coal prime sourc pollut billion ton offset per told electr carbon emiss place gener plant realli dont decreas emiss coalfir co emiss increas wonder coal plant applic increas co emiss gift next gener appar planet melt get betterfor pollut,106,0.2112676056338028,0.23214285714285715
1110055801,I thank the gentleman from California for yielding and congratulate him on the tremendous leadership that he has shown in bringing this measure to the House floor this afternoon. Madam Speaker. I rise in strong support of the bill. and I urge its approval by the House. It achieves broad reductions in greenhouse gases. enhances Americas energy security. and by placing a price on carbon dioxide. emissions. will. unleash investments in cleanenergy technologies that will create millions of new American jobs. These energy technologies will evolve from Americas laboratories. they will be deployed at home. they will be exported around the world. they will be the foundation for our next technology revolution. And it all starts here with passage today of the Clean Energy Security Act. Approximately 80 percent of the electricity in the district that I represent is coalgenerated. Coal production is one of our regions major industries. and it is a major employer of our constituents. Notsurprisingly. my focus in the shaping of the bill in the Energy and Commerce Committee was to keep electricity rates affordable and to enable utilities to continue using coal. which accounts for fully 51 percent of Americas electricity generation. Both of these goals have been achieved in the bill that is before us today. Electricity rates will be only modestly affected. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says that by 2020. the cost of the entire program for the typical American family will be $175 per year. The Environmental Protection Agency projects that the nearerterm cost for the typical family from all elements of this legislation will be between $80 and $110 per year. thats about 20 cents a day for .the typical American family. And so the claims by the opponents that this legislation will impose enormous electricity price increases are simply wrong. The Environmental Protection Agency projects that by 2020. the usage of coal in our economy will grow as compared to todays usage. Now. that may seem somewhat counterintuitive in a bill that regulates greenhouse gas emissions. so let me repeat that: the EPA projects that by 2020. coal usage in America. under the- terms of this bill. will actually grow. As transportation electrifies and lhe demand for electricity increases. coal. our most abundant fuel. will still be the fuel of choice to meet that rising demand. The claims of opponents that the CO2 controls under the bill will force utilities to surrender coal use. causing an overreliance on natural gas with attendant broad economic harm to the Nation. are also simply wrong. This is a responsible measure. It is carefully balanced. it reduces greenhouse gages by 83 percent by the year 2050 as compared to 2005 levels. it keeps electricity rates affordable. it enables coal usage to grow as the demand for electricity increases nationwide. and it opens the door to a more secure energy future and the creation of millions of new jobs. innovating. deploying and ex porting to the world the new. lowcarbondioxideemitting technologies that will power our energy future. Now. these are sound reasons to approve the bill. but -for those who still :harbor doubts. let me make a more practical argument to vote for passage. In March of 2007. the Supreme Court* held that carbon dioxide is a pollutant. Under that ruling. and the terms of the. existing Clean Air Act. the Environmental Protection Agency is now effectively required to regulate CO2 emissions. and so Federal regulation for greenhouse gases is now inevitable. It is not a question of whether we are going to have regulation. The only question is whether the regulation will be our carefully balanced. congressionally adopted. economically sustainable regulation. as contained within the bill before us today. or whether we will have EPAs regulation under the blunt instrument of the Clean Air Act where economic considerations cannot be fully waived. Given that choice. and the path this bill charts for affordable electricity. for increased coal use. and for new job creation. I would urge the Members to make the reasonable decision to approve today the Clean Energy Security Act.,111115370.0,BOUCHER,FREDERICK,H,VA,M,D,9.0,voting,H,2009-06-26,167,Mr. BOUCHER,Unknown,BOUCHER,Unknown,M,49211,49330,06262009.txt,4166,678,111,2009,california congratul tremend shown bring measur floor afternoon rise strong achiev broad greenhous gase enhanc america energi place price carbon dioxid emiss unleash invest cleanenergi technolog million new job energi technolog evolv america laboratori deploy home export around world foundat next technolog revolut clean energi approxim percent electr repres coalgener coal product region industri employ notsurprisingli focu shape energi electr rate afford continu coal fulli percent america electr gener goal achiev us electr rate modestli affect nonpartisan congression entir program typic famili per environment project nearerterm typic famili element per that cent day typic famili claim impos enorm electr price increas simpli wrong environment project usag coal economi grow compar usag seem somewhat counterintuit greenhous emiss epa project coal usag america term grow electrifi lhe electr increas coal fuel fuel choic meet rise claim co control forc coal caus overreli natur attend broad econom harm nation also simpli wrong respons measur care balanc greenhous gage percent compar level electr rate afford coal usag grow electr increas nationwid open door energi futur million new job deploy port world new lowcarbondioxideemit technolog energi futur sound doubt make argument march held carbon dioxid pollut term exist clean air environment effect co emiss greenhous gase inevit whether whether care balanc congression econom contain us whether epa blunt instrument clean air econom consider fulli given choic path chart afford electr increas coal new job make decis clean energi,359,0.34285714285714286,0.2318840579710145

1110020708,I rise today in support of Chairman OBERSTARS managers amendment to H.R. 1262. the Water Quality Investment Act. The managers package includes my amendment to the bill. the TeagueGreen wastewater amendment. My amendment is simple. It allows wastewater utilities to use resources from the Clean Water State Revolving Funds to implement renewable energy production and energyefficient projects in their plants. Wastewater- treatment plants are large consumers of power. Along with drinking water facilities. they consume approximately 35 percent of the energy used by municipalities. Together. they constitute 3 percent of national energy consumption. sending approximately 45 million tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere each year. We need to give our wastewater infrastructure an energy makeover. With my amendment to the eligible activities associated with the Clean Water SRF. the revolving funds can become prime motivation for energy conservation and energy generation at wastewater plants across the country. Employing resources from the SRF. plants can generate power from incircuit hydro turbines. biogas produced through anaerobic digesters. and solar panels and wind turbines. all offsetting electricity purchased from the grid. The TeagueGreen Wastewater Amendment will reduce the amount of energy consumed by wastewater plants. create green jobs. reduce greenhouse gas emissions and save money for taxpayers. It is what I like to call common sense.

They have been strong supporters of projects that will benefit the entire community. including restoring passenger rail service to the Quad Cities and the innovative ""River Vision"" urban flood plain management project along the Mississippi River. Madam Speaker. it has been a pleasure to work with Davenport One over the past year. This group of leaders is making Davenport a more sustainable and economically vibrant community.",,,,,,,,,,E,2008-09-30,324,Mr. BRALEY of Iowa,Unknown,BRALEY,Iowa,M,21948,21974,09302008.txt,988,143,110,2008,rise congratul davenport econom develop consortium repres davenport davenport execut award commun posit impact key commun davenport job small develop infrastructur plan davenport quad citi region strong project benefit entir commun includ restor passeng rail quad citi river vision urban flood plain project along river work davenport group leader make davenport econom vibrant commun,93,0.4090909090909091,0.23076923076923078

1100171494,Mr. President. this week the Senate has undertaken the beginning of a historic debate on global warming. For the past week we have attempted to pass this important legislation that will reduce the carbon dioxide pollution that causes global warming. while using market incentives to create American jobs. Unfortunately it appears the other side of aisle has no interest in enacting this important global warming legislation. I am disappointed a minority in the Senate are blocking our efforts to move forward on this important bill. The time for debate about the existence of global warming has ended. We are staring down the barrel of global crisis if we do not aggressively address this problem now. and not 5 years from now or when the oil companies decide the time is right. The most recent assessment of global climate change published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. IPCC. in November found that the Earths climate indisputably has warmed over the past century. Most of this increase is very likely due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations created by humansprimarily from the use of fossil fuels. As we look around us every day and see all of the exhaust gases emanating from factories. buildings. and vehicles. it only stands to reason that human. activity now. and for much of the last century. increasingly has become a factor in the quality of the air we breathe and in the natural processes of our environment. The U.S. Climate Change Science Program. CCSP. recently released the first of several climate change reports. and their assessment was stark. They report that even under the most optimistic carbon dioxide emission scenarios. we can expect a host of profound impacts that range from changes in sea level and regional and superregional temperature hikes. to increased incidence of disturbances such as forest fires. insect outbreaks. severe storms. and drought. If we do not take aggressive action now to curb emissions. our environmental and economic future is bleak. Even as we speak. our world is experiencing alarming and detrimental changes from manmade greenhouse gases. The Arctic Sea ice melted in 2007 to the smallest coverage since satellite measurements began in 1979perhaps 50 percent below sea ice levels of the 1950s. The U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado projects that the Arctic Ocean could be icefree in summer as early as As if to highlight the urgency. while the EPA was recently delaying a decision over whether to add polar bears to the threatened species list due to a decrease in their habitat. more than 160 square miles of arctic ice collapsed away from the Wilkins Ice Shelf. If we needed any clearer signal that now is the time to address this problem. the partial collapse of an arctic shelf formed more than 1500 years ago should leave no doubt. How do we responsibly and aggressively address this problem? According to the Bush administration. we should talk about curbing global climate change on the one hand. while quietly eroding the safety net that had been designed to better protect our environment with the other. We need only to look at the recent unprecedented intervention by this administration in the EPAs decision to override the institutional advice of the EPAs own expertsnot to mention the Clean Air Actand stop California. Vermont. and 15 other States from setting their own tailpipe emission standards. Even the release of CCSP research on climate change last week had to be mandated by court orderand during the course of this research. scientists left the CCSP alleging the administration was rewriting the science for political purposes. Add to all of this the auctioning of environmentally sensitive public lands for oil development. the weakening of air quality regulations for corporate polluters. and the billions of dollars of handouts in the form of subsidies to oil companies at the expense of renewable energy. and it adds up to 8 years of an administration that cares more about corporate profits than the publics health and our environments protection. This legislation is not a perfect solution. but its goals are positive and its solutions are constructive. The annual reductions in emissions. funding for renewable energy technologies. and a capandtrade system designed to reward companies that invest in cleaner energy are innovative solutions to a problem that wont just go away on its own. Failure to address global warming is a failure to address weather catastrophes that can destroy entire Nations. a failure to address the loss of species that will never return. and a failure to pass along to future generationsour children. our grandchildren. and beyondthe kind of world we want for them.,110120181.0,LEAHY,PATRICK,S,VT,M,D,,voting,S,2008-06-06,23,Mr. LEAHY,Unknown,LEAHY,Unknown,M,3190,3334,06062008.txt,4747,779,110,2008,undertaken histor global warm attempt import carbon dioxid pollut caus global warm market incent job unfortun appear side aisl interest import global warm disappoint minor effort move import exist global warm stare barrel global crisi aggress problem compani decid assess global climat intergovernment panel climat ipcc found earth climat indisput warm centuri increas like increas greenhous concentr humansprimarili fossil fuel look around us day see exhaust gase eman factori build vehicl stand human last centuri increasingli becom factor qualiti air breath natur environ us climat scienc program ccsp releas first climat report assess stark report even optimist carbon dioxid emiss scenario expect host profound impact rang sea level region superregion temperatur hike increas forest fire insect outbreak storm drought take aggress curb emiss environment econom futur bleak even world experienc alarm detriment manmad greenhous gase arctic sea ice melt smallest sinc satellit measur perhap percent sea ice level us nation snow ice data center univers project arctic ocean could icefre summer earli highlight urgenc epa delay decis whether polar bear threaten speci decreas habitat squar mile arctic ice collaps away wilkin ice shelf need clearer signal problem partial collaps arctic shelf ago doubt respons aggress problem bush talk curb global climat quietli erod safeti net better environ need look unpreced intervent epa decis overrid institut advic epa expertsnot mention clean air actand california tailpip emiss standard even releas ccsp research climat last orderand cours research scientist left ccsp alleg scienc polit purpos auction environment sensit land develop weaken air qualiti corpor pollut billion handout subsidi compani expens renew energi care corpor profit health environ perfect solut goal posit solut construct annual emiss fund renew energi technolog capandtrad reward compani invest cleaner energi solut problem wont away failur global warm failur weather catastroph destroy entir nation failur loss speci never failur along futur generationsour children grandchildren beyondth kind world want,418,0.2326388888888889,0.23076923076923078

1110071150,"Act will help to move a stalled debate forward by offering a more efficient. straightforward approach. Let me discuss how our bill would work. The CLEAR Act places an upstream cap on carbon entering the economy. The upstream cap on carbon would capture 96 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions. 93 percent of total annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by weight. and 82 percent of total annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by global warming potential. The initial annual carbon budget under the cap would be set based on the amount of fossil carbon likely to be consumed by the U.S. economy in 2012. the year in which the CLEAR Act regulations would begin. based on projections by the Energy Information Administration. For the first 2 years. the cap would stay at the 2012 level to give companies time to adapt to the system. Starting in 2015. the carbon budget would be reduced annually along a schedule designed to achieve nearly an 80 percent reduction in 2005 level emissions by 2050. The cap will recognize voluntary regional efforts like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. RGGI. RGGI is a cooperative effort by 10 northeast and midAtlantic States to limit greenhouse gas emissions. These 10 States have capped CO2 emissions from the power sector and will require a 10percent reduction in these emissions by Coal companies. oil and gas producers. and oil and gas importers would have to buy permits or ""allowances"" for the carbon in their products. They would buy the permits in a monthly auction in which those companies would be the only ones allowed to participate. One hundred percent of the allowances would be auctioned. no free allowances are provided to special interests. Thus. the CLEAR Act does not provide special favors like the House bill. Unlike the House bill. in the CLEAR Act. only the companies directly regulated by the legislation would participate in the auction. This avoids the huge potential for market manipulation and speculation to drive up carbon prices that exists in the House bill. Financial experts estimate that under the House bill. carbon permit trading could create a $3 trillion commodity market by 2020. Do we really want to have energy consumers subsidizing Wall Street traders? In the CLEAR Act. 75 percent of the carbon auction revenues would be returned to consumers as taxfree rebates. Nationwide. this means 80 percent of Americans would incur no net costs under the CLEAR Act. The average Mainer would stand to gain $102 per year from the CLEAR Act. By contrast. under the Housepassed cap and trade bill. the average citizen would experience a net cost increase of $175 per year. The other 25 percent of the auction revenues generated under CLEAR would go into a trust fund to fund energy efficiency programs and renewable energy research and development. to provide incentives for forestry and agriculture practices that sequester carbon. to encourage practices that reduce other greenhouse gases. to help energyintensive manufacturers. and to assist lowincome consumers. The fund. called the Clean Energy Reinvestment Trust. CERT Fund. would be subject to the annual appropriations process. This would allow Congress to adapt assistance for climaterelated activities on an annual basis. rather than being locked into a complicated allocation scheme that favors special interests. I applaud the leadership of my colleague from Washington for developing this straightforward. effective and fair climate bill.

It addresses climate change. promotes the development of cleanenergy sources. and brings us closer to our goal of securing Americas energy independence. This bill also takes extra steps to protect consumers while creating new green jobs. Nevada is in the forefront of renewable energy use. In 1997 Nevada enacted a renewable portfolio standard requiring that 20 percent of our electricity comes from renewable sources by 2015. Nevadas solar potential. coupled with our States geothermal and wind resources. will bring jobs to Nevada and make us a leader in the use of production of clean energy. In contrast. the alternative proposed by the House Republicans continues the same old failed policies. including the Yucca Mountain project. It doubles the amount .of nuclear waste that can be shipped to Nevada and jams twice as much of this radioactive garbage down our throats. The Republican plan to more than double the size of the Yucca * Mountain dump would only double the danger to families in Nevada and -across our Nation at a cost of hundreds of billions of dollars.

Its a widely held axiom that good agriculture policy is good Federal policy. This farm bill is a fulfillment of that statement. This legislation will continue a safety net for Americas producers and consumers. while providing a proper return on investment to the American taxpayer. The food and fiber commodity market is an extremely unpredictable place in which our producers have no ability to set their prices for their products. Furthermore. farmers and ranchers in all areas of the world are forced to deal with uncontrollable production risks that could at any time wipe out an entire years income at a moments notice. These are fundamentals that will never change. and I firmly believe that well always have a need for policies and mechanisms to address these issues.

1100186394,"Mr. President. I think we all agree that balancing environmental with energy goals can be a challenge. but it is a challenge we must confront now. Members of this body have discussed various proposals to regulate the output of greenhouse gases. Some advocate doing it though a capandtrade approach. Others have advocated a carbon tax. Such proposals are aimed at limiting future carbon output into the atmosphere. Discussion and debate is not enough. We need action now. One resource often overlooked is coal. Despite the recent pace in developing clean coal technologies. America cannot afford to simply give up on this challenge. Coal is an abundant. affordable. reliable. and secure energy source. It has the potential to become an even cleaner fuel. I believe another solution to protect our environment and our economy can be found in the GEAR Act. This bill takes a new look at climate change by tapping into human potential and the American spirit to develop the technological solutions we need to address climate change.

1100182101,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. since the beginning of the industrial revolution. the oceans have been the largest sink of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This is a valuable natural function. When the oceans absorb carbon dioxide. it lowers the pH of the water. Although the increased acidity of the oceans to date has not been significant. many in the ocean science community are concerned about the rate of change that they have witnessed. H.R. 4174 organizes Federal activities on ocean acidification research. It is intended to provide a blueprint for research and monitoring efforts at the Federal level. and encourage international cooperation for a global problem. We have an obligation to ourselves and to future generations to make informed decisions on something as serious as the health and welfare of our oceans. but at this point. we do not know enough to make those decisions. We do not know how much the oceans chemistry is going to change. how fast it will change. or what the impacts of this change will be on marine life or the health of marine ecosystems. We also do not know how all of this will affect mankinds reliance on the ocean for food. for industry. and for energy resources. How can we possibiy engage in serious discussions about mitigation and adoption strategies if we do not know these important things? Passing the Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act is the first step we need to take to collect this vital information. The legislation directs the Joint Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology. or JSOST. to coordinate all Federal research and monitoring activities. The subcommittee is cochaired by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA. the National Science Foundation. NSF. and the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the White House. These are the three agenpies.that should be most involved in ocean acidification research. This bill requires JSOST to develop a strategic research plan with an eye toward being able to produce useable products to the fishing industry. the energy industry. policy makers. and other shareholders at some point in the future. This strategic plan is not meant to reinvent the wheel. It should be based on several research road maps that have already been developed by other institutions. The legislation authorizes NOAA to continue its ocean acidification research and monitoring activities as long as such activities are consistent with the strategic research plan. It also authorizes funding for NSF to provide research grants for ocean acidification. And it directs NASA to focus resources on ocean acidification monitoring in future Earth observation missions.. Most importantly. H.R. 4174 requires that JSOST and NOAA coordinate U.S. ocean acidification research and monitoring efforts with those in the international community. Many countries are currently in the same place as we are. organizing their research efforts and laying out road maps for the future. Just last month. the European Union launched the European Ocean Acidification Project. an initiative to investigate ocean acidification and its consequences. The U.S. should not have to bear the full and sole burden for global environmental problems. International cooperation ensures that resources and funding are distributed among many nations so that all may benefit from the increase in understanding of ocean acidification.

1110026096,"I thank the Senator. At the outset. I note that this credit is a product of the Senate. it was not included in the preconference legislation that was passed by the House. Overall. we intend the credit to promote the manufacture of property that. until recently. has not been widely deployed in the United States. In particular. the credit is intended to benefit manufacturers of property (including component parts of property) that (a) harnesses renewable resources to produce energy. (b) enhances the efficient use of energy derived from conventional or renewable resources. or (c) reduces greenhouse gas emissions from energy produced by conventional resources. Treasurys creation of transparent scoring criteria will be critical for efficient delivery of the allocated credit amount. which. in turn. will drive efficient deployment of private capital. The new section 48C requires the Treasury Secretary to make awards only to projects for which there is a reasonable expectation of commercial viability. Commercial viability primarily considers readiness for deployment. It also considers capital requirements to reach endconsumers in a costeffective manner. Projects that have immediate and fungible markets and are positioned to compete in those markets have greater commercial viability than those that will require significant additional market development. Additionally. in determining viability the Secretary should consider the potential scale of market applications. and therefore the projects broader impact. In allocating credits. section 48C directs the Secretary to consider five additional factors. First. the Secretary shall consider projects that will provide the greatest domestic job creation. both direct and indirect. during the credit period: Because of their potential to catalyze additional growth. ARRAs stimulus objective will be maximized if the program supports emerging sectors and technologies. Accordingly. the Secretary should consider job creation estimates that include some evaluation of the potential breadth and scale of the propertys applications. including job creation potential of the propertys supply chain. distribution. installation. and maintenance. Second. the Secretary shall consider projects that will provide the greatest net impact in avoiding or reducing air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. Emissions from both the manufacturing projects operations and the installed energy property should be considered. Applicant projects should be compared to the existing mostlikely alternatives. and also to alternative new competing property. We expect that the Treasury Secretary will consult with the Department of Energy in estimating direct greenhouse gas emissions on a lifecycle basis for applicant projects. Additionally. the Treasury Secretary shall ensure that any potential project has received all Federal and State environmental authorizations or reviews necessary to commence construction of the project. Third. the Secretary shall look to projects that have the greatest potential for technological innovation and commercial deployment.. This criterion will ensure that tax credits are directed to those projects that have the greatest opportunity to catalyze new technologies. and thus multiply the tax credits impact. The Secretary might implement this standard by preferring .projects that are first- or secondofakind. or that employ significantly improved technologiesi.e.. those that will achieve significant improvements in cost or technology performance relative to existing solutions. Fourth. the Secretary shall prioritize projects that have the lowest levelized cost either of generated or stored energy. or of measured reduction in energy consumption or greenhouse gas emissions. Because it takes into account the installed system price and associated costs. such as financing and operation. levelized cost of energy is an accepted and common metric for comparing the cost of generating energy or saving energy across properties. In the case of property that generates or stores energy. the appropriate measure is levelized cost of generated or stored energy..which factors the cost per kilowatt hours of energy generated. In the case of property that conserves or more efficiently deploys energy. such as smart grid and metering technologies. or that reduces greenhouse emissions. the appropriate measure is levelized cost of measured reduction in energy consumption or greenhouse gas emissions. which factors the cost per kilowatt of energy saved or ton of carbon captured. Section 48C mentions the ""full supply chain"" and. in the case of reductions in energy consumption or greenhouse gas emissions. the Secretary should also consider emissions reductions in other parts of the supply chain that are enabled by the applicant project.

1100188572,CircumArctic Resource Appraisal is part of a project to assess the global petroleum basins using standardized and consistent methodology and protocol. This approach allows for an areas petroleum potential to be compared to other petroleum basins in the world. The USGS worked with a number of international organizations to. conduct the geologic analyses of these Artic provinces. Technically recoverable resources are those producible using currently available technology and industry practices. For the purposes of this study. the USGS did not consider economic factors such as the effects of permanent sea ice or oceanic water depth in its assessment of undiscovered oil and gas resources. The USGS is the only provider of publicly available estimates of undiscovered. technically recoverable oil and gas resources. Exploration for petroleum has already re-. sulted in the discovery of more than 400 oil and gas fields north of the Arctic Circle. These fields account for approximately 40 billion barrels of oil. more than 1.100 trillion cubic feet of gas. and 8.5 billion barrels of natural gas liquids.

1100181946,Mr. Speaker. I rise today to address the problem of skyrocketing gas prices. We must reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Our constituents deserve straight talk on this issue and here it is: The main component of the price of gasoline at the pump is crude oil. Crude oil is a commodity governed by the law of supply and demand. Therefore. we must reduce our demand and increase our supply. We should reduce our demand by having tax incentives for hybrids. raising fuel efficiency standards. and investing in alternative renewable energy sources like wind. solar. biomass. and nuclear. We must also increase our domestic supply of oil. We can do that by drilling in Alaska. drilling in the gulf of Mexico. and building more refineries.

1110049721,"Madam Speaker. I would first like to thank Rep. ELLISON for holding this special order tonight as Congress works to break away from businessasusual with regards to our nations energy future. I would also like to thank the Chairs of the Congressional. Progressive Caucus. Representatives WOOLSEY and GRIJALVA. for your leadership and your tireless efforts to promote proper stewardship of our communities by protecting the environment. It is so important that we continue to call for action on these issues surrounding global warming and the continued degradation of our environment that is perpetuated by our dependence on fossil fuels. As I have said time and time againthere is no denying the interconnection between our stewardship of the environment and the state E1393 E1394 of the economy. public health. and our communities. The drastic acceleration of greenhouse gas emissions has often been concentrated in lowincome and minority communities. putting these vulnerable populations on the ""front lines"" of the fight against environmental degradation and global climate change. Simply put. climate change has. and will continue to exacerbate the problem of poverty and inequality. and none of us can afford to take this lightly. The health of our community and our neighbors affects all of us. Let me take a moment to reflect upon the urgent need to finally put a price on carbon emissions and make polluters pay for the pollution they produce. As a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. I look forward to working with my colleagues here in Congress to pass responsible and comprehensive climate legislation that will establish a price for carbon emissions and spur the development of clean. renewable energy and the deployment of muchneeded energy efficient technologies. Legislation which sets us on the path toward energy independence and a new. lowcarbon economy will help to maintain the United States position as a leader in innovation while at the same time creating hundreds of thousands of good paying green jobs. The biggest misconception out there today regarding our environment is that the public isnt engaged. or willing to transition to a sustainable. environmentallyfriendly economy. In reality. the shift to a lowcarbon economy represents an economic opportunity for individuals across this country. One of the most exciting and inclusive solutions to the many issues facing environmental health is the possibility afforded to us by promoting Green Jobs Training and the growth of the Green Economy in America.

1110032832,Mr. Chair. I urge my colleagues to support the National Water Research and Development Initiative Act. There is a tendency to take the availability of clean drinking water for granted. Even in a state like Michigan. which is surrounded by water. we have become increasingly aware that the Great Lakes are a finite resource. To that end. the eight Great Lakes states came together last year and adopted a compact to manage and protect the Lakes. With the approval of the Great Lakes Compact by Congress. at long last we closed the door to bulk diversion of Great Lakes water. The Compact also establishes a comprehensive management framework to protect this shared resource and requires Great Lake states to control their own largescale water use. In other parts of the Nation. it is clear that water supplies are under increasing stress. Drought. population increases. and growing demand has resulted in water shortages in many areas. and these shortages are expected to become more pronounced over time. Currently. more than 20 federal agencies carry out research on water. water quality. and water management. The bill before the House will begin to coordinate national research and development efforts on water to provide the tools and information to manage water resources more effectively. I want to make clear that nothing in this legislation authorizes. encourages or mentions water diversion from the Great Lakes. That is off the table. What is under discussion today is better coordination of programs that already exist to improve federal activities on water. involving research. data collection. modeling. education and the development of technology to enhance water quality and supply. As much as any other region. the Great Lakes states stand to benefit from more effective use of federal water research and development dollars. Let me also express my support for the amendment offered by Representatives KIRK and QUIGLEY which requires the National Water Research and Assessment Plan established in this legislation to include longterm projections of water levels and ice cover of major water bodies. especially the Great Lakes. The loss of winter ice on the Lakes results in faster evaporation of the water. We need better data to understand the decline of ice cover in the Great Lakes and the impact this decline has on water levels in the Lakes.

1110066384,Madam Speaker. were going to utilize our 60 minutes this evening on the floor so as to have Democrats speak to jobs as they relate to this energy rethinking so that we can address the energy reforms that are essential for the strengthening of this Nation. to embrace our intellectual capacity. and to provide opportunities in job growth by promoting a strong sense of energy security. enhancing our energy independence. and therefore addressing favorably. Madam Speaker. our national security. All of these fine dynamics are met as we think outside the barrel. if you will. on energy policy. How do we create these jobs? Well. there is just a sampling in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that. when passed in early February. spoke to the creation of a half million jobs. That will now be invested through the Department of Energy. other resources. other agencies on the Federal level of government to make certain that we grow these opportunities through research and development investment. through energy efficiency. through renewables that are available through wind. solar. and the Earth. through geothermal. making certain that we can go forward with a progressive agenda so as to speak to a cleaning up of the environment and the security strengthener for the American economy by growing less reliant on fossilbased fuels. That gluttonous dependency that this Nation has on those fossilbased fuels is driving down our economy. and we have the potential here to enter a clean energy race. a global energy race. and win that race. I am joined this evening. Madam Speaker. by two of our colleagues who have asked to participate so as to insert their thinking and to share their enthusiasm with the American audience and those here in the House about the job potential as it relates to energy reforming and energy transformation. Were joined by Representative JAY INSLEE from the State of Washington. the First District of the State of Washington. and were also joined by Representative BEN LUJAN from the Third District in the State of New Mexico.

1110009901,I think the electrification of automobiles as an energy source is gaining a lot of attention. There is a growing understanding that building a smart grid and allowing plugins to fill up when electricity prices are cheapest and when there is a lot of unused electricity capacity. turning our cars into additional storage capacity makes a lot of sense. People believe we could create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the near future and that we would be able to benefit from that as a basis of an infrastructure. I look at China and think of the 250.000 jobs they have already created just in battery manufacturing. And that 120 companies are focusing just on manufacturing lithiumion batteries. They have already created an economic opportunity. an edge for Asia in this marketplace that will continue to sustain them for the future in the automobile manufacturing industry. We are at a totally new day. where we should pause and reassess all new opportunities to strengthen our country. and yet we are not capitalizing on the economic opportunity that is going to fundamentally reshape automobile transportation for the better. I thank my colleague from Michigan for pointing those facts out and raising those questions because. again. she has been steadfast in this and understands this is about a manufacturing opportunity for the future of the United States as a manufacturing base. Whether those are foreign competitors. whether those are new domestic companies that have never been on the radar screen. whether they are the domestic manufacturers that are working hard to make the transition to this new opportunity. this amendment would address all of those. In conclusion. today the United States is home to about 35.000 less factories than in the year 2000. In that short period of time we have lost around 4 million manufacturing jobs. Clean energy technologies. and particularly electric vehicle manufacturing. is a keystone strategic opportunity that could help change that around. That is why I am offering this amendment with my colleague. Senator HATCH. and others. because it can be effective stimulus today. but pay longterm dividends for the future of the U.S. economy.

1110056225,"Madam Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 2454. the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009. For years. the consensus in the scientific community has been that the release of greenhouse gasseg into the atmosphere is altering the Earths climate in ways that are expensive and deadly. This is one of the principle subjects I have spoken about and worked pn for decadesbefore and since I first ran for officeand it is one of the reasons.. I believe that my constituents sent me to Congress. Today the House of Representatives at last is taking sweeping action to cap greenhouse gas emissions. promote the production of renewable energy. and make our homes. cars. and businesses more energy efficient. This legislation would require that we reduce our carbon emissions by 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050. It would implement a Renewable Electricity Standard that would require electric utilities to provide 20 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2020. It would make historic investments new clean energy technologiestand energy efficiency. including energy efficiency and renewable energy. carbon capture and sequestration. electric and other advanced technology .vehicles. and research and development. These provisions would help to slow the rate of global warming and preserve our environment for future generations. Further. a recent report from the Center for American Progress estimates that these provisions would help to create 1.7 million new. high skilled clean energy jobs over the next decade. Opponents of this bill have argued that it would cost American families over $500 a year in additional energy costs. While it is true that.there would be increases in the cost of energy. this bill would retum"" almost 50 percent of the proceeds from the capandtrade auction to consumers. In my home state of New Jersey. families who currently pay $100 on their monthly energy bill would see their bill increase by less than $3 a month. If you include the savings that would come through the energy efficiency provisions in this legislation American families could save $4.000 by 2030 on their energy bills. . According to the Environmental Protection Agency. in NewJersey climate change has caused temperaturesto be 4 degrees- warmer than they were in 1970. Over the past century precipitation has increased by 5 percent and severe weather incidents have increased by 1220 percent. and sea level along our coast is increasing .14 inches a year. It is worth devoting some money and effort to slow the devastating climate change is having on our state. I am pleased that several provisions that I wrote were included in this bill. I worked with Rep. GEORGE MILLER and Rep. JERRY MCNERNEY authorize the WaterSense program that would help consumers identity water efficient products. Water efficiency saves energy by reducing the amount of energy used to heat. transport. and clean water. The savings are substantial and real. According to the Environmental Protection Agency. if only one out of every 100 American homes retrofitted their homes with waterefficient fixtures. we would save 100 GWh of electricity. enough energy to power more than 9.000 homes for an entire year. while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80.000 tons. Rep. JARED POLLS and I wrote a provision that would require the Departments of Energy. Labor and Education to compile an online database for a renewable energy curriculum that would be easily accessible to community colleges. vocational schools and universities. looking to create training programs but lacking local or technical expertise. The transformation to a clean energy future will require a trained workforce and our amendment would ensure that these communities. whether in rural Wyoming or urban Pittsburg.. have easy access to green jobs training in new energy and new manufacturing sectors so they can prosper in a new energy economy. I worked with Rep. ROSA DELAURO. Rep. TAMMY BALDWIN. and Rep. BRIAN BAIRD to include a provision that would allow the Secretary of Energy to create a research program to study the role that human behavior will play in energy consumption and climate change. Changing consumer behavior offers.a promising opportunity to promote energy independence and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. however there is still much to be learned about the forces that drive consumer actions. As a member of the Committee on NatOral Resources. I worked to make sure that sufficient funding from the cap and trade auction would be used for domestic and international adaptation. Funding allocated under thisprovision would help to ensure the protection. restoration. and conservation of natural resources and enable them .to become more resilient. adapt to and withstand the impacts of -climate change and ocean acidification. It will require the study of how wildlife corridors will change as climate change affects migration patterns and identity the steps to minimize the effects of climate change on migratory species. It would be used to protect the public health from the effects of climate change. Internationally. it would be used to prevent the tropical deforestation that is adding billions of tons of carbon to our atmosphere. I remain deeply concerned that this bill does not include the necessary research and development funding that is needed to reach the 80 percent reduction target set in H.R. 2425. We will not be able to meet this goal with todays technologies. and as written. the bill does not provide the billions of dollars a year that will be needed to develop them. This is not a small or parochial concem. If Americans and others around the world are to embrace a transformation in the way we use and produce energy. they must. know that our effort includes the engine to drive the innovation for that transformation. Without a very robust research effortmany billions of dollarsthe vision of transformation will be a mirage and the public will know it. I have been assured by Chairman WAXMAN. Chairman MARKEY. Speaker PELOSI. members of the Administration and members of the Senate that they understand this shortcoming and that they will work with me to increase the research funding to drive the innovation we need to transform the way we produce and use energy. Ultimately. I support this bill because doing nothing is not an option. If we continue on the same path the U.S. Global Change Research Program estimates that average global temperatures will increase 11 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. causing among other effects a rise in sea level of 3 to 4 feet. completely flooding low lying. areas like the Everglades and Cape Canaveral or Cape May. By passing this legislation we can slow the rate of climate change. we can create millions of new jobs. save consumers money through energy efficiency. and end our reliance on foreign fossil fuels.

1100209498,Mr. President. I want to take a moment to call attention to the recent action of the Government of Indonesia to preserve the endangered rain forests an ecosystems of Sumatra. On October 10. 2008. the Indonesian Government. in cooperation with the World Wildlife Fund. WWF. announced an agreement between the 10 provincial governors of Sumatra to protect biodiversity on the worlds sixth largest island. Although long overdue. this is an important first step towards conservation of a unique habitat at a critical time. Sumatra is the only place on Earth where tigers. elephants. rhinos. and orangutans coexist. It has also gained a reputation for having lost almost half of its natural forest cover since 1985. The rapid expansion of palm oil and pulpwood plantations. as well as rampant illegal logging. have been largely to blame. These activities have contributed to the precipitous decline in numbers of these endangered specids. whose habitat has become a patchwork of disconnected small parcels of forest. This action to protect the forests is important not only for Indonesia but for the rest of the world. Thirteen percent of Indonesias remaining forests grow on peat soil. which emits large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere when trees are felled. Further destruction of these forests will contribute to global warming at a time when we should be doing everything possible to reduce greenhouse gases. This agreement represents a significant change of attitude and policy. for which President Yudhoyono and his government deserve credit. Implementing the agreement will be difficult. requiring additional resources for alternative economic opportunities for people living in these areas. and for enforcement. and I urge the U.S. Agency for International Development and other donors to support it.,110120181.0,LEAHY,PATRICK,S,VT,M,D,,voting,S,2008-11-19,171,Mr. LEAHY,Unknown,LEAHY,Unknown,M,10879,10930,11192008.txt,1817,284,110,2008,want take moment call attent indonesia preserv endang rain forest ecosystem sumatra octob indonesian world wildlif fund wwf announc provinci sumatra biodivers world largest island although long overdu import first toward conserv uniqu habitat sumatra place earth tiger eleph rhino orangutan coexist also gain reput almost half natur forest sinc rapid expans palm pulpwood plantat well rampant log larg blame contribut precipit endang specid whose habitat becom patchwork disconnect small parcel forest forest import indonesia rest world thirteen percent indonesia forest grow peat soil emit larg amount carbon dioxid atmospher tree fell destruct forest contribut global warm everyth possibl greenhous gase repres signific attitud polici yudhoyono deserv credit implement difficult econom peopl area enforc us intern develop donor,158,0.23880597014925373,0.22549019607843138

1110073180,"Madam Speaker. I rise to discuss the $2.4 million that was included at my request in the FY10 Defense Appropriations Bill for Synthetic Liquid Fuels. Considering the large amounts of potential CO2 emissions produced by a coal or a natural gastoliquids facility. technologies will have to be developed to ascertain the feasibility of sequestering the CO2. Recent investigations by the U.S. Department of Energy have shown that between 8 and 12 billion barrels of additional oil can be recovered from the existing Alaska North Slope oil fields with using CO2 enhanced oil recovery technology. Alaska North Slope oil reservoirs present a potentially large target or ""sink"" for sequestering the CO2 generated in a Fairbanksbased coaltoliquids or a coal/ gastoliquids plant. thereby enhancing conventional oil recovery as a byproduct. However. very little practical study of CO2 sequestration has directly addressed the Alaska North Slope area. Moreover. in the present case. effective CO2 sequestration is highly dependent on the technologically and economicallyfeasible transportation of CO2 from the Fairbanks source to the Alaska North Slope.

1100182100,and particularly Mr. INGLIS. who worked so closely with me on the managers amendment to this bill. We have an enormous problem facing this world. and it is often neglected. This bill addresses that. On Monday. I had the privilege of being in Fort Lauderdale at the International Society for Reef Studies. their coral reef symposium. which happens every 4 years. Based on reports there and recent studies published in Science and other leading journals. it is clear that although ocean acidification is not often talked about. it may well be a challenge as great or perhaps even greater as climate change. Approximately onehalf of the carbon dioxide released by burning fossil fuels has been absorbed by the oceans. The good news is that this absorption has helped reduce and delay the impact of global warming. The bad news. however. is that the absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide has caused and will continue to cause changes in ocean chemistry. The disruption in ocean chemistry causes the pH to decrease and results in a phenomenon identified as ocean acidification. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administiation. ocean -hydrogen ion concentration. a measure of acidity. has increased 30 percent since industrialization. Studies have projected that by the end of the century. carbon dioxide emission scenarios could result in the lowest levels of ocean pH in 20 million years. The potential impacts of acidification are diverse and farreaching. These impacts include adverse effects on marine ecosystens. food webs for many fish and marine mammals. and the economies of many coastal States that rely upon the seafood industry and coastal and ocean tourism. Increasing acidity and changes in ocean chemistry are also corrosive to corals and shellforming plankton. a major food source for baleen whales and commercially important fish species such as salmon.. mackerel. herring. cod and others. Some studies have also suggested that ocean acidification could be detrimental to shellfish. including scallops. clams. oysters and lobsters. Evidence shows that calcification rates will decrease and carbon dissolution rates will increase for these calcifying organisms leaving them unable to compete ecologically. perhaps even threatening them to the point of extinction. Shallow water corals face similar threats due to decreased ocean rates and increased shell corrosion. Corals comprise some of the richest habitats on Earth. According to NOAA. about 4.000 species of fish. including approximately half of all federally managed fisheries. depend on coral reefs and their related habitat for a portion of their life cycles. Juvenile fish may face physiological challenges. including respiratory stress and acidosis associated with increased acidification. Deep sea corals and other animals are also threatened by changes in chemistry. and may find parts of the deep ocean uninhabitable by the end of the century. We must do more to assess this grave problem. There is significant uncertainty as to the rate and magnitude of change that will occur. but national investment in a coordinated program of research and monitoring could improve the understanding of ecosystem responses. assess socioeconomic impacts due to increasing acidification. and provide resource managers the information they need to develop strategies and protect these critical species. Thats why I have joined Representatives ALLEN. INSLEE. and others. in introducing the Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act. This bill establishes an interagency program through the Joint Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology of the National Science and Technology Council to develop and coordinate a comprehensive plan to better understand and address the impacts of acidification. to provide for assessment of ecosystem and socioeconomic impact of ocean acidification. and to provide for research on adaptation strategies to conserve marine resources. It also directs NOAA. the National Science Foundation. and NASA to conduct research and monitoring activities on ocean acidification consistent with the strategic plan developed by the subcommittee. I want to thank the researchers who have led the way on this important topic. also my fellow sponsors for their important work. and particularly Chairman GORDON and the other members of the Science and Technology Committee for moving this bill and getting it to the floor. Finally. I want to thank the Science Committee staff. including Jean Fruci. Shimere Williams on the majority staff. and my own staff member. Hillary Cain. With that. Mr. Speaker.

1100180712,In December 2007. the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund (CCEF) Board announced a $1.18 million grant to the Lee Companys Westbrook production facility for the development of a solar photovoltaic system. On Friday. June 27. 2008 the Lee Company will celebrate the returns on these* investments: Connecticuts largest solar photovoltaic system at a manufacturing facility. I rise today to recognize this monumental achievement and commend. the Lee Company and the CCEFs leadership with facilitating a greener Connecticut for current and future generations. In. 1948. the Lee Companywas founded by Leighton Lee II in eastern Connecticut. Over the past six decades. the Lee Company has transformed the original Connecticut regional offices into a national presence. Today. the company remains one of the foremost developers and manufacturers of fluid control components for aerospace systems. The CCEF was established by Connecticuts General Assembly in 2000. Since inception. the CCEF. administered by Connecticut Innovations. has invested millions of dollars in renewable energy projects throughout Con- necticut. focusing on solar. biomass. wind. hydro. and wave power. In my district alone. the Fund has provided nearly $14 million in incentive grants for 207 alternative energy projects. Current operating renewable energy projects are estimated to generate 5 million kWh and eliminate over 4.1 million pounds of greenhouse gas emissions over the course of each year. As important as the states help was in this project. it was the vision and determination of the Lee Company that really made the projects exciting transformation of its energy system possible. The CCEFs incentive grant to the Lee Company. which covered half the cost of the 308kilowatt photovoltaic system at the Westbrook production facility. is one of the largest in the state of Connecticut. Once operating. the photovoltaic system will provide 19 percent of the energy used at the facility. When the system is not in use. energy production credits will be deducted from the companys electric bill. In addition to reducing dependence on fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions. these investments will generate new economic growth and opportuniity. The Lee Company employs more than 100 individuals at the Westbrook production facility and more than 800 people throughout the state. These investments will allow for the continued growth of the company and expanded employment opportunities throughout Connecticut. Madam Speaker. our Nation is at a critical turning point. .For the strength of our economy and health of our environment. investments in clean. renewable energy are needed now more than ever. I ask my colleagues to join with me and my constituents in recognizing these renewable energy achievements and supporting similar initiatives in their districts.,,,,,,,,,,E,2008-06-26,1052,Mr. COURTNEY,Unknown,COURTNEY,Unknown,M,60253,60320,06262008.txt,2835,431,110,2008,decemb clean energi fund ccef announc million compani westbrook product facil develop solar photovolta friday compani celebr invest largest solar photovolta manufactur facil rise recogn monument achiev commend compani ccef facilit greener current futur gener companywa found leighton eastern decad compani transform region nation presenc compani foremost develop manufactur fluid control compon aerospac ccef establish gener sinc incept ccef invest million renew energi project con necticut focus solar biomass wind hydro wave alon fund provid nearli million incent energi project current renew energi project estim gener million kwh million pound greenhous emiss cours import help project vision determin compani realli project excit transform energi possibl ccef incent compani half kilowatt photovolta westbrook product facil largest photovolta provid percent energi facil energi product credit deduct compani electr depend fossil fuel greenhous emiss invest gener new econom growth opportuni compani employ individu westbrook product facil peopl invest allow continu growth compani expand employ nation point economi health environ invest clean renew energi need ever recogn renew energi achiev similar,249,0.3287671232876712,0.22448979591836735

1110068095,"Madam Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 1854. This bill will revise a previously authorized project to allow the mountain community of Big Bear. which is located in the 41st Congressional District. to move forward with the Army Corps of Engineers to begin replacement of an aging water infrastructure. The bill reduces the authorized amount of the project by $3 million. The city of Big Bear Lake currently distributes water through pipes that are over 70 years old and crumbling by the minute. This lack of integrity from the water infrastructure has led to declining water quality. massive water loss. and dangerously low flow levels that do not meet firefighting standards. California is in the midst of a water crisis. and San Bernardino County has been granted Federal disaster status due to extreme drought conditions. In a misguided effort to protect fish. the Federal Government has shut off pumps for the California Aqueduct. further reducing water supplies for southern California communities. Under these severe conditions. we cannot overlook any opportunity to conserve what water we have. This bill will provide immediate and measurable conservation. Equally dire. Big Bear is located within the San Bernardino National Forest. Because of lack of consistent management in the past. the San Bernardino National Forest has become a powder keg for wildfire. We have made some progress at reducing the threat through aggressive hazardous fuels removal. but the danger remains extreme. Replacing the water infrastructure will help protect the Big Bear community and provide the U.S. Forest Service with another vital weapon in the event of catastrophic wildfire. As a side benefit. the increased pressure in the pipes will also drastically reduce the power consumption currently needed to pump water throughout the system. It has been a priority of this Congress to implement policies that conserve resources and I believe this bill is consistent with those goals.

1100206029,Madam Speaker. I rise today to offer the Act to Save Americas Forests. Our forests are an extraordinary natural resource which must be preserved. Unfortunately. aggressive logging practices on Federal land have eliminated much of our Nations remaining forests and their native biological diversity. This is a sensible bill to limit aggressive logging and protect our forests and our environment. The Act to Save Americas Forests bans clearcutting in all Federal forests. It also ends logging in the last virgin forests. roadless areas. and other core regions of the Federal forest system. The bill allows for limited and ecologically sustainable logging in lands that have already been logged outside of core forest areas. An important provision of the bill transfers jurisdiction of the Giant Sequoia National Monument from the Forest Service to the Park Service to manage and protect this important ecological asset. The Forest Service has continued to allow logging of the sequoias. which is not acceptable. and the courts finally put a stop to this egregious practice. My constituent. Martin Litton. has fought tirelessly for decades to protect the magnificent giant sequoia trees and the congressional action proposed in the Act to Save Americas Forests will ensure their long term protection. This year. the bill includes a new provision for the Department of Interior to conduct environmental surveys to identify ecosystems not currently included in our national park system. These studies will identify needs to ensure that our national parks will preserve as much natural diversity as possible. Preserving our forests not only ensures that we will maintain the natural beauty of our Nation. it will help mitigate climate change by reducing carbon emissions. Forests are an important carbon storage medium and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated that deforestation accounts for 2025 percent of annual greenhouse gas emissions. In 2006. the Environmental Protection Agency estimated that forests in the U.S. absorbed enough carbon dioxide to offset 11 percent of our countrys emissions. Logging reduces the capacity of our forests to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. so unless we act E2041 now to prevent aggressive logging. we could lose 5080 percent of our carbon storage capacity and reduce our ability to mitigate the effects of climate change. The Act to Save Americas Forests will ensure that future generations of Americans will inherit and enjoy our Nations irreplaceable natural forest treasures. Im very proud to introduce this bipartisan bill with 70 cosponsors and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in supporting this important piece of legislation.,,,,,,,,,,E,2008-09-27,1081,Ms. ESHOO,Unknown,ESHOO,Unknown,F,71789,71865,09272008.txt,2723,426,110,2008,rise america forest forest extraordinari natur preserv unfortun aggress log land nation forest nativ biolog divers sensibl limit aggress log forest environ america forest ban clearcut forest also log last virgin forest roadless area core region forest allow limit ecolog log land alreadi log core forest area import provis giant sequoia nation monument forest park import ecolog asset forest continu allow log sequoia final egregi litton fought tirelessli decad magnific giant sequoia tree congression propos america forest ensur long term includ new provis depart environment survey identifi ecosystem current includ nation park identifi need ensur nation park preserv natur divers possibl preserv forest ensur maintain natur beauti nation help mitig climat carbon emiss forest import carbon storag medium intergovernment panel climat estim deforest percent annual greenhous emiss environment estim forest us absorb enough carbon dioxid offset percent emiss log capac forest absorb carbon dioxid atmospher unless aggress log could percent carbon storag capac mitig effect climat america forest ensur futur gener inherit enjoy nation irreplac natur forest im proud introduc bipartisan side aisl import piec,253,0.3466666666666667,0.22448979591836735
1110056234,Madam Speaker. I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2454. the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009. I believe that climate change is occurring. and that increased greenhouse gas emissions have profoundly impacted our climate and our resources. To combat these changes. we need to develop a sustainable energy policy that will meet our energy needs today without compromising the ability of our children and grandchildren to meet their energy needs tomorrow. For these reasons. I support a balanced energy plan that will increase our energy independence by promoting the development and deployment of 1) renewable domestic sources of energy. such as ethanol and biodiesel. and 2) technology that will use traditional fuels in acleaner way. such as clean coal carbon capture and storage. These energy sources eventually may satisfy the needs. of the entire country. but they are still being developed and expanded. We must ensure that Americans maintain access to affordable and reliable energy until these sources are broadly available. I oppose H.R. 2454 because it does not provide a bridge for. coal and other fossil fuels to develop and demonstrate new technologies to provide reliable energy and meet the necessary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The timelines contained in this legislation do not provide sufficient time to put these technologies in place. Manufacturers andutility companies will be forced to stop using the affordable. abundant fuels they use today and transition to far more expensive energy sources. As a result. this bill will force our most affordable domestic energy source. coal. into extinction. Energy costs will skyrocket and workers will face layoffs and plant closures. American families cannot face these additional burdens during these difficult economic times. In addition. we cannot ignore the fact that climate change is a global problem and requires a global solution. We must consider the consequences of enacting this legislation when other countries.. like China and India. have not taken steps to reduce their own carbon emissions. Without some measure of equity on this issue. our emissions may appear to decrease. but they will simply shift ove?seas. taking jobs and industries with them.. Madam Speaker. I oppose H.R. 2454 because it does not do enough to bridge the transition to clean energy sources. to prevent spikes in electricity costs. to protect workers from new layoffs. or to provide a global solution to climate change. Quite simply. it is the wrong bill at the wrong time. I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing this measure.,111116750.0,COSTELLO,JERRY,H,IL,M,D,12.0,voting,H,2009-06-26,600,Mr. COSTELLO,Unknown,COSTELLO,Unknown,M,57888,57947,06262009.txt,2604,415,111,2009,rise hr clean energi believ climat increas greenhous emiss profoundli impact climat combat need develop energi polici meet energi need without compromis children grandchildren meet energi need tomorrow balanc energi plan increas energi independ promot develop deploy renew domest sourc energi ethanol biodiesel technolog tradit fuel aclean way clean coal carbon captur storag energi sourc eventu satisfi need entir develop expand ensur maintain access afford reliabl energi sourc broadli avail oppos hr provid bridg coal fossil fuel develop demonstr new technolog provid reliabl energi meet necessari greenhous emiss timelin contain provid suffici technolog place manufactur andutil compani forc afford fuel transit far expens energi sourc result forc afford domest energi sourc coal extinct energi skyrocket worker face layoff plant closur famili face burden difficult econom fact climat global problem global solut consid consequ like china india taken carbon emiss without measur equiti issu emiss appear decreas simpli shift ovesea take job industri oppos hr enough bridg transit clean energi sourc spike electr worker new layoff provid global solut climat quit simpli wrong wrong oppos measur,235,0.2671232876712329,0.22429906542056074
1110000933,Madam Speaker. today. my distinguished colleague Mr. MICHAUD and I. along with several of our other colleagues. are introducing the bipartisan Department of Veterans Affairs. VA. Energy Sustainability Act of 2009. This legislation would establish strategic and longterm plans for energy sustainability and conservation within the VA. Addressing our Nations energy problem calls for Congress to adopt a multifaceted approach to include the use of alternative fuels. restructuring building systems. and encouraging the use of energy efficient systems and vehicles. Our bill would require a report on the installation of alternative fuel stations at VA facilities. as funded in P.L. 110329. and require a feasibility study regarding the installation of energy efficient and renewable energy systems in Department buildings. Such systems include solar technologies. energy efficient roof and building envelope systems. wind tecbnology. and woodbased biofuels. As our country adapts to the increased global demand for energy resources. it is imperative that we effectively implement wise consumption policies and take real steps to mitigate the impact of increased costs. This bill would create a VA Office of Energy Management. and an Energy Advisory Committee consisting of VA officials and private sector experts on energy management. The Office of Energy Management. with the advice and recommendations of the Energy Advisory Committee and national laboratories such as those at Lawrence Livermore and Oak Ridge. would be responsible for helping VA meet a number of specific energy sustainability goals. This includes compliance with Presidential Order 13423. VA Directive 0055. and the long term sustainable energy plans in this legislation. The office would also establish a database to track VAs energy and water consumption. In an effort to assist our Nations veterans in their individual efforts to become more energy efficient. our bill would provide an additional amount of up to $10.000 for high efficiency systems for veterans who qualify for specially adaptive housing grants under section 2101(a)(2) of title 38. United States Code. Additionally. it would provide veterans who qualify for a specially adapted auto grant. under section 3902(a) of title 38. United States Code. the additional amount necessary to purchase alternative fuel vehicles. Finally. VA would be authorized to conduct a pilot program for the sale of air pollution emission reduction incentives. also known as emission reduction credits. and VA would be authorized to retain proceeds from the sales. Americas veterans should benefit from the VAs efforts to produce cleaner energy. Madam Speaker. as the cost of fossil fuels rises and resources become scarcer. our nation must provide services for our veterans in an energy efficient manner. A sustainable energy program at VA will conserve energy and financial resources that can be used to provide care for our veterans.

1100163171,Mr. Speaker. let me commend the chairman and ranking member for their hard work. And I stand in support of this conference report. This truly is a bipartisan piece of legislation that the House Agriculture Committee has produced and one that affects every citizen in this country. Agriculture is the number one industry in my home State of North Carolina. It is responsible for $66 billion in income and employs almost onefifth of the States workforce. Mr. Speaker. it is critical that we have a stable farm policy in this country. not just for North Carolina. but for every child that participates in the nutrition program. for every food bank and for every school lunch program. The bill increases the funding for the Nations nutrition programs by over $10 billion. provides over $1.1 billion for renewable energy. and increases funding for conservation efforts by $6.6 billion. And for new and growing sectors of agriculture like organic foods. we have included. for the first time. mandatory funding for specialty crop research and marketing.

1100161847,Madam Speaker. I rise today with a heavy heart after receiving news of the devastating Cyclone Nargis which struck Burma this past weekend. As of today there have been over 100.000 reported dead or missing in Burma. and millions more remain in dire conditions as a result of the storm. Especially concerning is the capability of the nations ruling military junta to assist the populace in transmitting much needed food. water. and medical supplies within a reasonable time frame. There have already been reports that the repressive regime has been slow to provide this needed assistance. The United States and the international community must expedite humanitarian assistance to Burma and press the government to open up to aid from the global community and assist in its distribution. A rapid response can help ensure this tragedy does not expand into a national catastrophe for the people of Burma. At this time I urge my colleagues to support any measures which extend aid to the people of Burma. My thoughts and prayers are with the families of Burma who must mourn the loss of so many loved ones. and must now rebuild their lives and their country.,,,,,,,,,,E,2008-05-12,134,Mr. SHULER,Unknown,SHULER,Unknown,M,15499,15526,05122008.txt,1153,195,110,2008,rise heavi heart news devast cyclon nargi struck burma weekend report dead burma million dire condit result storm especi concern capabl nation junta assist populac need food water medic suppli alreadi report repress regim slow provid need assist intern commun expedit humanitarian assist burma open aid global commun assist distribut rapid respons help ensur tragedi expand nation catastroph peopl burma measur extend aid peopl burma thought famili burma mourn loss love rebuild,104,0.32558139534883723,0.22413793103448276

1110052592,Mr. President. today I introduce an important piece of legislation that will help protect and preserve the health and productivity of one of our Nations most important bodies of waterthe Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf of Mexico Restoration and Protection Act will serve as a national. and international model for the collaborative management of large marine ecosystems. Specific provisions of this Act will be administered by the Gulf of Mexico Program. formed in 1988 by the Environmental Protection Agency as a nonregulatory. inclusive partnership that collaborates with federal offices. state. and local governments and the private sector in each of 5 Gulf Statesall committed to helping preserve and protect the Gulf. Collectively. the fertile waters and seabed of the Gulf of Mexico represent the 6th largest economy in the world with a total economic trade value of almost $6 trillion. These waters are now threatened by excessive nutrient loads and invasive species as well as the significant deterioration of many coastal wetlands as a result of hurricane and tropical storm damage. The future of the Gulfs environmental stability is vital to Americas economy and security. This legislation authorizes much needed additional funds to the Gulf of Mexico Program and finally puts it on a path toward more equal footing with other national great water body programs. Members of the Gulf of Mexico program are working together to secure the Gulfs future. It is time for this critical region to be recognized for its strategic importance. This legislation is an important step toward ensuring the Gulf receives the kind of support it deserves.,111118271.0,WICKER,ROGER,S,MS,M,R,,voting,S,2009-06-19,82,Mr. WICKER,Unknown,WICKER,Unknown,M,4687,4733,06192009.txt,1640,262,111,2009,introduc import piec help preserv health product nation import waterth gulf gulf restor nation intern model collabor larg marin ecosystem provis gulf program environment nonregulatori inclus partnership collabor local sector gulf statesal help preserv gulf collect fertil water seab gulf repres largest economi world total econom trade valu almost trillion water threaten excess nutrient load invas speci well signific deterior coastal wetland result hurrican tropic storm damag futur gulf environment stabil vital america economi author need fund gulf program final path toward equal nation great water program gulf program work togeth gulf futur region recogn strateg import import toward ensur gulf kind deserv,150,0.3090909090909091,0.2236842105263158
1100197494,Mr. Speaker. we have an opportunity here to decide to make policy instead of continuing to play politics. I happen to be among those who believe that we cannot drill our way out of this energy crisis. yet I support this bill that contains significant offshore and domestic drilling. and Ill tell you why. This will offer a transition fund so that we can go from an energydependent economy on oil to an independent energy economy. What this bill will do is marry the argument that has been made on the other side that we have to have supply to get from here to therethats true. its indisputableand that developing our own domestic resources is a way to help us. get there. And it marries that to establishing that the revenues that will be generated will be used for the benefit of the American. people to achieve the goal of energy independence. which requires two things: It requires investment in research and development of alternative energies. and it requires investment in the implementation of alternative energy projects. So what you have here is a recognition that we do need supply. thats true. Thats been the argument of the Republican side. Valid point. But it also recognizes that we need a sustainable financial fund in order to implement research and development in the implementation of clean energy projects. This bill also cracks down on speculation. makes oil available. which will have an impact on the price of oil. It does a whole array of things that most of us are in agreement need to be done on wind. solar. biomass. So. Mr. President. we cant drill our way out. but we cant get to where we need to be. a post oildependent economy. unless we have a sustainable energy fund that will allow us to do that. We managed to do this in Vermont when we had a.fierce debate over nuclear power. and in the storage of nuclear waste. assessed a fee that went into a clean energy fund. It is now allowing schools to literally cut in half their cost of heating their schools. This is a very wise decision and allows us to work together to get something done.,110121720.0,WELCH,PETER,H,VT,M,D,0.0,voting,H,2008-09-16,359,Mr. WELCH of Vermont,Unknown,WELCH,Vermont,M,30670,30729,09162008.txt,2070,370,110,2008,decid make polici instead continu play polit happen among believ drill way energi crisi contain signific offshor domest drill transit fund energydepend economi independ energi economi marri argument side suppli get therethat true indisputableand develop domest way help us get marri establish gener benefit peopl achiev goal energi independ two invest research develop energi invest implement energi project recognit need suppli that true that argument side valid point also recogn need financi fund implement research develop implement clean energi project also crack specul make avail impact price whole array us need done wind solar biomass cant drill way cant get need post oildepend economi unless energi fund allow us afierc nuclear storag nuclear assess fee clean energi fund allow school liter cut half heat school wise decis allow us work togeth get someth done,175,0.2672413793103448,0.2235294117647059
1110059093,I thank the chairman for his work and his committees great work on this bill. Mr. Chair. I rise today in support of H.R. 3246. This bill is another example of Congress commitment to reducing our dependence on foreign oil. creating green jobs to revitalize our economy. and reestablishing America as a global innovation leader. I have seen firsthand how our investments are paying off for my hometown of Louisville. Kentucky. There. 400 new jobs are being created thanks to Recovery Act funding that incentivized General Electric to move the production of an energy -efficient water heater from China back to the United States in Louisville. H.R. 3246 represents another step forwardthis time. by ensuring our Nations auto industry will drive innovation by developing clean and efficient technologies for every type of vehicle. This important legislation establishes research and development programs that will lower petroleum usage and emissions in heavyduty vehicles that are key to commerce but are often recognized as some of the least efficient in operation. At the Kentucky truck plant. also in my hometown. hardworking employees produce the FSeries heavyduty truck. By developing new technologies to make heavyduty trucks more energy efficient. more fuel efficient and. therefore. more in demand. Ford will be able to expand operations and create new jobs. Thats what this legislation is all about. investing in green technology to create goodpaying U.S. jobs and to stimulate economic growth while continuing our efforts to ensure that America leads the world in the industry that will dominate the global economy for decades to come. We cannot afford to pass up this opportunity. I. therefore. urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting the Advanced Vehicle Technology Act.,111121800.0,YARMUTH,JOHN,H,KY,M,D,3.0,voting,H,2009-09-16,130,Mr. YARMUTH,Unknown,YARMUTH,Unknown,M,6127,6178,09162009.txt,1786,283,111,2009,work great work rise hr anoth exampl depend foreign green job revit economi reestablish america global leader seen firsthand invest pay hometown louisvil new job recoveri fund incentiv gener electr move product energi effici water heater china back louisvil hr repres anoth forwardthi ensur nation auto industri drive develop clean effici technolog vehicl import establish research develop program lower petroleum usag emiss heavyduti vehicl key recogn least effici truck plant also hometown hardwork employe produc fseri heavyduti truck develop new technolog make heavyduti truck energi effici fuel effici ford expand new job that invest green technolog goodpay us job stimul econom growth continu effort ensur america lead world industri domin global economi decad come afford advanc vehicl technolog,164,0.2857142857142857,0.2235294117647059
1100203693,"Mr. Speaker. I remain frustrated that Congress has yet to arrive at a compromise to ensure a majority vote in both chambers on a comprehensive energy package. There is a finite supply of oil and increasing global demand. and this picture will not change. For this reason. I believe that all solutions are essential in any compromise legislation striving to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil. so that future generations are not faced with the same energy problems. It is my goal to continue to work toward a compromise package. which can be signed into law. to deliver the relief the American public needs now and an energy policy for the 21st Century. New domestic offshore drilling has been the subject of much debate over the last few months. With Delawares coastline and tourism economy in mind I have been cautions about any new drilling that could have a negative impact. However. I do believe that additional domestic oil and gas production on a limited basis and carried out in an environmentally sound manner is realistic. so that American dollars no longer go overseas to in some cases unfriendly nations. Coupled with this must be a sincere commitment to invest in renewable energy development and energy efficiency measures. It is this way that we will improve our national security. help address climate change. improve American competitiveness. and create jobs. Today I voted to support maintaining a ban on oil and gas development up to 50 miles off our coastlines. to allow drilling between 50 and 100 miles offshore if states give the green light. and. to allow the federal government to permit drilling from 100 to 200 miles offshore in the Outer Continental Shelf. The bill ensures drilling happens in a way that protects ""coastal environment. marine environment. and human environment of state coastal areas and the Outer Continental Shelf."" A strong protective barrier between our coastlines and where new drilling could begin is important for protecting sensitive coastal habitat and the tourism industry Delaware. A sustainable federal funding mechanism for conservation and alternative and renewable energy initiatives. which this bill includes. is critical. but I also support revenue sharing with the states. including impacted neighboring states. which this legislation unfortunately omits. As for renewable energy production and energy efficiency measures. which I have supported many times in the last few months. the bill provides $19 billion over ten years in tax incentives. Included in this is a shortterm extension of the production tax credit for renewable energy production. like wind facilities. critical for states like Delaware pushing offshore wind projects. We must continue strive for longerterm incentives. To pay for the continued investment in these important measures. the bill requires U.S. oil companies to renegotiate leases and pay royalty payments and repeals certain tax incentives at a time of record profits. The legislation also includes a requirement that power companies generate 15 percent of their energy from renewable sources by 2020. which I have previously supported. The measure also allows leasing federal lands for oil shale production. only if states like Colorado. Utah and Wyoming allow it. While I believe alternative fuels are important to develop. I believe we should not make commercially available those that are more greenhouse gas intensive than conventional fuels. Other provisions included in the bill are tax incentives for coal projects that capture carbon. plugin hybrid cars. and fueling stations for natural gas vehicles. and grants for public transportation agencies. requiring the U.S. Department of the Interior to offer oil and gas lease -sales on the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska on an annual basis. encouraging completion of a new oil and gas pipeline to aid the transmission of supply. and reinstates the ban on the export of Alaskan oil. Additionally. this bill requires oil companies to ""diligently develop"" all of their current leases for energy production or relinquish them. Finally. the legislation requires the government to release 70 million barrels of crude oil in exchange from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Many of these provisions have been considered by the House in earlier iterations and I believe represent substantive small steps we can take now to make additional supply available and some of which could reduce prices Immediately. My priority is promoting pragmatic solutions that cover a broader spectrum of energy policies. including intensifying development of alternatives. extending renewable and efficiency tax credits. implementing stronger efficiency standards. and encouraging more conservation. A comprehensive compromise energy policy is critical for our national security. public health. meeting the challenges of global warming. and bolstering the economy. There is no silver bullet and we must be willing to compromise. I hope that the House and Senate will now sit down and craft yet another compromise that we can deliver to the President as soon as possible.",,,,,,,,,,E,2008-09-25,919,Mr. CASTLE,Unknown,CASTLE,Unknown,M,64357,64474,09252008.txt,5101,799,110,2008,frustrat arriv compromis ensur comprehens energi packag finit suppli increas global pictur believ solut compromis strive depend foreign futur gener face energi problem goal continu work toward compromis packag relief need energi polici st centuri new domest offshor drill last month coastlin tourism economi mind caution new drill could neg impact believ domest product limit basi environment sound realist longer oversea case unfriendli nation sincer invest renew energi develop energi effici measur way improv nation help climat improv competit job maintain ban develop mile coastlin allow drill mile offshor give green light allow drill mile offshor outer continent shelf ensur drill happen way coastal environ marin environ human environ coastal area outer continent shelf strong barrier coastlin new drill could import sensit coastal habitat tourism industri fund mechan conserv renew energi includ also share includ impact neighbor unfortun renew energi product energi effici measur last month provid billion incent includ shortterm extens product credit renew energi product like wind facil like push offshor wind project continu strive longerterm incent pay continu invest import measur us compani renegoti leas pay royalti payment certain incent profit also includ compani gener percent energi renew sourc previous measur also allow leas land shale product like allow believ fuel import develop believ make commerci avail greenhous intens convent fuel provis includ incent coal project captur carbon plugin hybrid car fuel station natur vehicl us depart leas nation petroleum reserv annual basi encourag complet new pipelin aid transmiss suppli reinstat ban export alaskan compani develop current leas energi product final releas million barrel crude exchang strateg petroleum reserv provis consid iter believ repres substant small take make suppli avail could price promot pragmat solut broader spectrum energi polici includ intensifi develop extend renew effici credit implement stronger effici standard encourag conserv comprehens compromis energi polici nation health meet challeng global warm bolster economi silver bullet compromis sit craft anoth compromis soon possibl,466,0.3088235294117647,0.22340425531914893

1100138907,Mr. Speaker. last week the price of oil surpassed $100 per barrel for the first time ever. American families are hurting from these record prices. Gas prices are up 17 cents in just the last 2 weeks. Since 2001 when President Bush came into office. gas prices have doubled. up to $3.13 a gallon from $1.47 In 2001. At the same time. oil company profits have tripled. from $30 billion in 2001 to $123 billion in 2007.. ExxonMobil alone had a profit of $40 billion. $132 for every American citizen. Its time our country set a new direction for energy policy by taking advantage of Americas greatest resource. our ingenuity and our innovation. This legislation embraces this goal. It accelerates the use of clean domestic renewable energy sources and alternative fuels through longterm extension of production tax credits. This legislation increases research. development and deployment of clean. renewable energyefficient technology. and this legislation promotes the use of energyefficient products and conservation. including a provision for energyefficient commercial buildings. which I introduced as separate legislation called the Buildings for the 21st Century Act.

1100149054,Madam Speaker. I rise today to recognize Joel Estrada of Lewisville. Texas for his efforts to protect the environment. Joel has been granted a rebate by the Texas Emissions Reduction Program (TERP) to replace an oldermodel dump truck. Joels involvement in this program illustrates that the E502 world can be made better through the efforts of a single person. Estradas TERP rebate will allow him to upgrade his current dump truck to a new. more environmentfriendly vehicle. Joels participation moves TERP one unit closer to reaching its goal of replacing 4.500 older diesel engines with newer. less polluting models. Over the course of the next 7 years. the new dump truck will stop 5.8504 tons of nitrogen oxides from polluting the planet. The Texas Emissions Reduction Program presents businesses with the opportunity to save money and protect the environment by trading in their business vehicles for costefficient diesel engines that conserve fuel more effectively. Over all. North Texas businesses have accumulated more than $3.3 million in savings and cut down pollution by nearly 353 tons to date. The rebates and grants offered by TERP set a positive example of the benefits of replacing and modifying older diesel engines for the Nation. Madam Speaker. it is with great pride that I rise today to congratulate Joel Estrada of the 26th District of Texas. He is a phenomenal example to other small businesses. and I heartily commend him for doing his part to help reduce pollution in North Texas one engine at a time.,,,,,,,,,,E,2008-04-03,739,Mr. BURGESS,Unknown,BURGESS,Unknown,M,71296,71346,04032008.txt,1524,252,110,2008,rise recogn joel estrada lewisvil effort environ joel rebat emiss program terp oldermodel dump truck joel program world better effort estrada terp rebat allow upgrad current dump truck new environmentfriendli vehicl joel particip move terp closer reach goal older diesel engin newer pollut model cours next new dump truck ton nitrogen oxid pollut planet emiss program money environ trade vehicl costeffici diesel engin conserv fuel effect north accumul million cut pollut nearli ton date rebat terp posit exampl benefit older diesel engin nation great pride rise congratul joel estrada phenomen exampl small commend part help pollut north engin,147,0.32978723404255317,0.2222222222222222

1100137720,"language and EPA rulemaking do not allow for 2year consecutive ""carryover"" of credits. This means that although the industry has exceeded the 2007 requirements. they would be unable to apply these credits after 12 months. My bill would accommodate the uncertain levels of production from year to year. Considering the myriad variables involved in the ethanol production process including crop yields. land use. and feed stock prices. it only makes sense to allow more flexibility. Another fix extends the small refinery exemption by 2 years. This language also does nothing to change mandated levels. A small refinery produces less than 75.000 barrels average daily aggregate and EPACT exempts these facilities from the renewable fuels numbers until 2011. These refineries are dealing with drastically smaller economies of scale in production.

1100187154,Mr. Speaker. I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 6545. the National Energy Security Intelligence Act of 2008. introduced by my distinguished colleague from Louisiana. Representative DON CAZAyoux. This legislation is an important step in ensuring that rising energy costs do not endanger American lives. It is obvious that the steep incline in energy prices that has been plaguing our citizens cannot be tolerated much longer. as it has led to rising food costs. transportation costs. and inflation. In addition to these economic issues. energy prices also negatively impact national security. One key step in managing this situation is assessing the future supply and demand for crude oil. natural gas. and alternative fuels. By doing so. we limit the unpredictability of the energy market and its impact on daily lives. This will prevent energy and food crises like the one we are currently experiencing from occurring in the future. Additionally. investigating the effects that rapidly escalating energy costs- and extreme price fluctuations could have on national security is absolutely crucial. The possibility of energy sales being used to fund terrorist organizations or other adversaries of the United States. cannot be ignored. Americans cannot allow the money we spend on travelling to work or school everyday to end up in the hands of those who mean us harm. This is why we must know the implications of increasing funding through energy revenue to potential adversaries of the U.S.. and we must also understand the intentions of key energyproducing and exporting nations with respect to energy production and supply. This legislation will allow us to decide which countries are trustworthy business partners. and which countries we must limit our energy trade with. It is also necessary to examine the national security implications of Americas dependence on international energy supplies in order to further determine the benefits of exploring alternative energy supplies. By requiring the Director of National Intelligence to submit to Congress a national intelligence assessment on national security and energy security issues relating to rapidly escalating energy costs. H. Res. 6545 assures that these issues will be examined and- addressed. As Members of Congress. and representatives of the people. it is our duty to ensure the safety and wellbeing of Americans. I urge my fellow Representatives to join me in support of H. Res. 6545. which is an essential step for national security.,110119920.0,JACKSON LEE,SHEILA,H,TX,F,D,18.0,voting,H,2008-07-22,532,Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas,Unknown,JACKSON-LEE,Texas,F,45103,45165,07222008.txt,2508,394,110,2008,rise strong nation energi intellig introduc distinguish repres cazayoux import ensur rise energi endang steep energi price plagu citizen toler longer led rise food inflat econom issu energi price also neg impact nation key situat assess futur suppli crude natur fuel limit unpredict energi market impact daili energi food crise like current experienc futur investig effect rapidli escal energi extrem price fluctuat could nation absolut crucial possibl energi fund terrorist adversari allow money spend travel work school everyday mean us harm know implic increas fund energi potenti adversari us also understand key energyproduc export nation respect energi product suppli allow us decid trustworthi partner limit energi trade also necessari examin nation implic america depend intern energi suppli determin benefit explor energi suppli nation intellig nation intellig assess nation energi issu relat rapidli escal energi issu examin repres peopl ensur safeti wellb repres nation,225,0.375,0.2222222222222222

Clean energy can provide an engine to drive the Nation out of recession and sustain our economy for years to come. In my hometown of Louisville. Kentucky. we are already seeing the dividends from investments made in this country with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in the form of new green jobs. Earlier this week General Electric announced it would relocate production of a new energyefficient water heater from China to.Louisiilles Appliance Park. which is the location of the Consumer Products Division of GE. Federal dollars allocated to the State energy fund from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and reserved for the manufacture of energyefficient products -are available to support this project and others like it.

1110060855,"Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of H.R. 860. legislation to reauthorize the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000. I want to commend the gentlelady from Guam who is my good friend and Chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Insular Affairs. Oceans and Wildlife. Congresswoman BORDALLO. for her leadership on this important issue. I also want to commend Chairman RAHALL and members of the Natural Resources Committee for bringing this important bill before the House for consideration. Mr. Speaker. much has been said about how our coral reefs are in a critical state but it must be reemphasized that the conservation of coral reef is a national priority. especially given its ecological. social. economic and scientific value. Known also as the ""rainforests of the sea."" coral reefs provide support to about 4.000 documented fish species. 800 species of hard corals. and hundreds of other species. which is more species per unit area compared to any other marine ecosystem. Economically. coral reefs provide the basis for an estimated $400 billion global fishing and tourism industry. For the Territories in the South Pacific Region. the economic value of coral reefs is even steeper. For example. estimates of annual economic value of coral reefs in Guam ($127.3 million). the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands ($61.7 million). and American Samoa ($5.8 million). demonstrate the importance of this resource to island economies. But even more significant. there is increasing interest in research on corals for possible cures for cancer. arthritis. human bacterial infections. viruses and other diseases. In addition. corals which live 300 years or more may contain environmental data that can assist scientists to better understand climate change and also improve studies on ocean acidification. Yet. more than 28 percent of the worlds coral reefs have been lost forever. The list of environmental threats facing coral reefs is long including overfishing and destructive fishing practices. ship groundings and debris. impacts of human population growth and shoreline development. polluted runoff and degraded water quality. and siltation and impaired water clarity. In addition. more studies have revealed climate change also poses serious threats. including ocean acidification and warming of tropical and subtropical coastal waters. Such is the seriousness of threat on coral reefs that the global community declared 2008 as the International Year of the Reef. This was even recognized by the House in the last Congress through the unanimous passage of House Resolution 1112. To address these many threats to coral reefs. Congress passed the Coral Reef Conservation Act which established the Coral Reef Conservation Program within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to fund coral reef conservation activities. H.R. 860 follows this successful model in place and provides additional tools and mechanisms to better protect our coral reefs. In addition. I am especially encouraged that this bill also recognizes the importance of providing funding and resources to institutes that are directly impacted and also pursuing further exploration and research of coral reefs. Under this bill. universities and research centers. such as coral reef institutes or other educational institutions such as the University of Guam or American Samoa Community College. will be given resources and support to conduct ecological research and monitoring that builds capacity for more effective resource management. I cannot reemphasize enough the importance of coral reefs to our nation and the rest of the world. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on H.R. 860 and help protect our coral reefs.",111117590.0,FALEOMAVAEGA,ENI,H,AS,M,D,0.0,nonvoting,H,2009-09-22,32,Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA,Unknown,FALEOMAVAEGA,Unknown,M,3029,3119,09222009.txt,3707,571,111,2009,rise strong hr reauthor coral reef conserv want commend guam good chairwoman subcommitte insular affair ocean wildlif congresswoman bordallo import issu also want commend rahal natur bring import consider said coral reef reemphas conserv coral reef nation especi given ecolog social econom scientif valu known also rainforest sea coral reef provid fish speci speci hard coral speci speci per area compar marin ecosystem econom coral reef provid basi estim billion global fish tourism industri south pacif region econom valu coral reef even steeper exampl estim annual econom valu coral reef guam million commonwealth northern mariana island million samoa million demonstr import island economi even signific increas interest research coral possibl cure cancer arthriti human bacteri infect virus diseas coral contain environment data assist scientist better understand climat also improv ocean acidif percent world coral reef forev environment threat face coral reef long includ overfish destruct fish ship ground debri impact human popul growth shorelin develop pollut runoff degrad water qualiti siltat water clariti reveal climat also pose seriou threat includ ocean acidif warm tropic subtrop coastal water serious threat coral reef global commun intern reef even recogn last threat coral reef coral reef conserv establish coral reef conserv program nation ocean atmospher noaa fund coral reef conserv hr success model place provid tool mechan better coral reef especi encourag also recogn import provid fund institut directli impact also pursu explor research coral reef univers research center coral reef institut institut univers guam samoa commun colleg given ecolog research monitor build capac effect reemphas enough import coral reef nation rest world hr help coral reef,341,0.2644230769230769,0.2222222222222222

1110047601,Madam Speaker. I just want to point out something about the benefits of efficiency in this bil.- We know its going to help the important auto industry. but I want to point out how it will help consumers in efficiency. - Under this bill. Americans who participate will save an average of 133 gallons of gasoline a year by having access to a more efficient car. At the price of $2.71 a gallon. thats a saving of $368 a year in gasoline. That is 250 million gallons of gasoline that we otherwise will not be burning. Now. the reason I point this out is there is a benefit to the environment in our efforts. to stop global warming in this bill. and Mr. ISRAEL and Ihad earlier introduced a piece generally in the same direction. heading with the great leadership of BETTY SUTTON and JOHN DINGELL and BART STUPAK. and we put our bills together. and this is the product. Some folks have argued that the efficiency provisions of this bill are not aggressive enough. The bill I introduced with Mr. ISRAEL had more aggressive targets. But I want to point out something that is a singular achievement of this bill. and I want to thank iBETTY SUTTON for her leadership on this. If we are going to stop global warming. we indeed are going to have to come together all across the country. Folks in the steel industry are going to need to work with people on the coast. People in the Midwest. in the Rust Belt States in the auto industry are going to need to work with those folks in the San Francisco Bay region. Congress means coming together. and this bill. I think. represents a perfect example of how our Nation needs to come together to tackle the many challenges we have in dealing with global warming. And when we pass this bill today. it will be one step. one brick in the wall of that effort. for a true clean energy revolution in America that we can all be proud of across the country.

1100193916,Madam Speaker. I rise today to commend the leaders of the Energy Efficiency Caucus. Representatives MARK UDALL and ZACH .WAMP. for spearheading the Congressional Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Expo. More than 50 businesses from around the country will demonstrate their sustainable energy technologies. Energy efficiency must be the cornerstone of our energy policy because it affords our country the ability to decrease demand for oil and other energy sources. thus reducing our overall energy consumption and increasing our national security. Congress must enact incentives to make sure that these technologies flourish. As I travel across Connecticuts Second Congressional District. I have seen firsthand the innovation that businesses. school districts and families are employing to reduce their energy costs and reduce energy emissions. Earlier this week. I- attended a House field :hearing in Hartford. Conneoticut. at which the leaders of General Electric and United Technologies Corporation. both headquartered in Connecticut. discussed their energy efficient technologies. These two companies. like the ones exhibiting at the EXPO. have developed a variety of products for all sectors of the economy. At the same time. these companies are also seeing their own energy consumption and costs lowered as they embrace energy efficient technologies internally. I encourage my colleagues to stop by the EXPO in the Cannon Caucus Room on Thursday anytime between 9 a.m.-5 p.m. It is an opportunity to see innovation firsthand.,,,,,,,,,,E,2008-08-01,371,Mr. COURTNEY,Unknown,COURTNEY,Unknown,M,36208,36244,08012008.txt,1536,229,110,2008,rise commend leader energi effici repres udal zach wamp spearhead congression renew energi energi effici expo around demonstr energi technolog energi effici cornerston energi polici afford decreas energi sourc overal energi consumpt increas nation incent make sure technolog flourish travel congression seen firsthand school famili employ energi energi emiss attend field hear hartford conneoticut leader gener electr technolog corpor headquart discuss energi effici technolog two compani like exhibit expo develop varieti product sector economi compani also see energi consumpt lower energi effici technolog intern encourag expo room anytim pm see firsthand,136,0.35714285714285715,0.2222222222222222

1110055658,"Madam Speaker. before I begin my remarks. I would like to speak briefly about all that the Speaker has meant to this body. Since coming to Congress. I have watched ELLEN TAUSCHER navigate the legislative and political waters of the House of Representatives. She has always done so with uncommon grace. skill and acumen which we would all be well served to emulate. We will all miss her presence here in this Chamber. whether in the chair or on the floor. But we know that she will continue to serve our country well in her new capacity as Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security at the State Department. Madam- Speaker. H. Res. 587 provides a structured rule for consideration of H.R. 2454. the Arnerican Clean Energy and Security Act. The resolution pro vides for 3 hours of general debate with 22 hours controlled by the Committee on Energy and Commerce and 30 minutes controlled by the Committee on Ways and Means. Madam Speaker. from coast to coast we are seeing the effects of our changing climate. Just last week. experts from 13 government agencies and several universities issued a new report on global climate change impacts in the United States. Their analysis was clear: global warming is caused by humaninduced -emissions. It is also already having visible impacts in the United States. We are seeing these effects throughout our country. from increases in heavy storms to rising sea levels. From earlier snow melt to alterations in river flows. These. experts concluded that negative .effects of climate change will continue to worsen. Climate. .hange will Combine with other air pollution- populationj:growth overuse of resources. and social. economic. and environmental stresses to create larger impacts that will be felt. around the world and here at home. For my constituents. this threat is very real and very urgent. Californias Department of Water Resources projects that the Sierra Nevada snow pack will experience a 25 to 40 percent reduction by 2050. These are not empty numbers. As Californias climate warms. more of the Sierra Nevadas watershed will continue to peak storm runoff. Highfrequency flood events are projected to increase as a result. We have no choice but to adapt to these changing realities. .In. Sacramento. we live at the confluence of two great rivers. the Sacramento and the American. As global warming intensifies. scientists predict greater storm intensity that could forever change these rivers flow patterns. This means that my district will have to cope with more direct runoff and more flooding. I want to thank Chairman WAXMAN and Chairman MARKEY for working with me to ensure that this bill addresses Californias water needs in the context of climate change. Allowances are distributed to States for urgent projects to help fight extreme weather and flooding. These resources are vital as we work to adapt to changing climates and more intense weather patterns. In order to deal with these issuesand with others that confront us all. the Energy and Commerce Committee has held countless hearings on energy and climate change policy over the past 2/2 years. This year alone we have convened over a dozen hearings and heard from numerous experts. as well as national and international leaders. In total. the committee has held over 40 days of hearings on energy and climate change policy over the past two Congresses. During- these deliberations. over 300 witnesses testified. including 130 in this year alone. Whether or not we all. agree with Chairman WAXMAN and Chairman MARKEY Oft the issue of global. warming. and I personally do. we should all applaud the work these two chairmen have done to get us here today. This bill is not only an achievement for the American people. but also for our children and our grandchildren. By spurring a new era of clean energy jobs. this bill puts our economy on a new trajectory. And because of this investment. our children and- grandchildren will live in a country that is more sustainable. more economically viable. and more efficient than the country we live in today. The legislation will create millions of new clean energy jobs. enhance Americas energy independence. and protect the environment. Specifically. it requires electric utilities to meet 20 percent. of . the electricity.: demand. through renewable .and. energy sources and energy efficiency.by 2020. .. It also.invests in new clean .energy. technologies and energy efficiencies.. including energy efficiency and renewable energy carbon capture and sequestration. and basic scientific research and development. It mandates "" new energysaving standards for buildings. appliances. and industry. and it reduces carbon emissions from major U.S. sources by 17 percent by 2020 and over 80 percent by 2050. These are the nationwide impacts of this groundbreaking legislation. Part of the brilliance of this bill before us today. though. is that it also gives tools to local communities to fight climate change on their own. One of the ways this bill does so is through the transportation sector. Transportation accounts for 30 percent of the greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere each year. Therefore. effective climate change legislation must include /a transportation component if we are going to achieve the emission reduction levels that scientists say are -vital to saving our planet. I appreciated working with the committee on section 222. which seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through comprehensive transportation efficiency and land use planning. The way we plan our communities and transportation systems has a real effect on how well we reduce emissions from transportation. This legislation also protects consumers from energy price increases. According to estimates from the EPA. the reductions in carbon pollution required by the legislation will cost American families only 22 to 30 cents per day. But fighting global warming is not just about preserving our current way of life. it is also about creating a cleaner. stronger economy that will power the United States toward a clean energy future. EPA .analysis shows that the Nations gross domestic product would grow from $13 trillion in 2008 to over $22 trillion in 2030 while deploying clean- energy technology and reducing global warming pollution. And consumption. an economic measure of a households purchasing potential. would grow by 8 to 10 percent from 2010 to 2015. and 23 percent to 28 percent by 2030. With. the American- Clean Energy and Security Act. we are making- smart investments. We are giving entrepreneurs the tools they need to create clean energy jobs that demand American skills and that put our country in a strong position to compete internationally. Madam Speaker. with the American Clean Energy and Security Act. we will show the rest of the world that America is back and we are ready to lead again.

1110069425,Mr. President. I am pleased to sponsor the Coral Reef Conservation Amendments Act of 2009. This bill reauthorizes and strengthens the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000. a program that I originally sponsored in the 106th Congress establishing the Coral Reef Conservation Program at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA. Coral reefs are among the oldest and most economically and biologically important ecosystems in the world. They provide habitat for more than one million diverse aquatic species. a natural barrier for protection from coastal storms and erosion. and are a potential source of treatment for many of the worlds diseases. In addition. reefsupported tourism is a $30 billion industry worldwide. and the commercial value of U.S. fisheries from coral reefs is more than $100 million. However. our coral reef ecosystems face many threats including pollution. climate change and coral bleaching. and overfishing to name a few. Coral reefs cover only onetenth of one percent of the ocean floor. yet provide habitat for more than 25 percent of all marine species. The original Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000 recognized the need to preserve. sustain and restore the condition of these valuable coral reef ecosystems. It directed NOAA to develop a National Coral Reef Action Strategy. established a NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program. and created a Coral Reef Conservation Fund to support publicprivate partnership projects. The Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000 also authorized NOAA to provide emergency grants to address unforeseen and disasterrelated impacts to coral reefs. The Coral Reef Conservation Amendments Act of 2009 would strengthen NOAAs ability to comprehensively address threats to coral reefs and empower the agency with tools to ensure that damage to our coral reef ecosystems is prevented or effectively mitigated. It also establishes consistent practices for maintaining data. products. and information. and promotes the widespread availability and dissemination of that environmental information. The bill allows the Secretary to further develop partnerships with foreign governments and international organizations as well as with Federal agencies. State and local governments. tribal organizations. educational institutions. nonprofit organizations. commercial organizations. and other public and private entities. These partnerships are critical not only to the understanding of our coral reef ecosystems. but also to their protection and restoration. Finally. the bill allows for any amount received by the United States as a result of illegal activity resulting in the destruction. take. loss. or injury of coral reefs to be used toward restoration efforts. I would urge my colleagues to support this important legislation and I hope that we may pass this bill quickly to continue supporting NOAAs leadership role in coral reef conservation.

1100180299,Mr. President. I am going to keep pounding home the facts behind the relationship between food prices and biofuels. because it is not supported by economics. it is not supported by common sense. and it is not supported by sound science. The fact is. biofuels are increasing our national security. biofuels are helping our balance of trade. and they are reducing our dependence on Middle East oil and the whims of big oil. Every barrel we use of biofuels is $135 not going to some foreign land where they train terrorists to kill Americans. So it ib time we cleared the air. it is time we looked at the facts. and it is time we recognize. once again. that everything about our domestic renewable fuel industry is good. good. good. I emphasize it is good for the environmentless C02 in the airit is good for good jobs in rural America. because a lot of these ethanol refineries are in rural America. where we never thought we would have goodpaying jobs. and a lot of these refineries respond to another problemwe dont have enough oil refineries in this country. In a sense. every ethanol plant. every biofuels plant is a refinery. It is good for our national security. which I think I have made very clear. and it is good for agriculture. It is good that we dont have Government supporting surplus grains. We are not having taxpayers money go out to farmers. Farmers are getting their money from the marketplace now that prices are higher. So I dont know how many times I have to say it. but there are no negatives about biofuels and everything about them is good. good. good.

1100211284,Madam President. earlier this summer. when gasoline prices were topping $4 a gallon. I asked the GAO to analyze potential savings from the establishment of a national speed limit. I did not prescribe what that speed limit should be. merely asked the GAO to conduct an analysis at which speeds vehicles were most fuel efficient and make a determination as to whether a national speed limit would have positive impacts on the conservation of gasoline. My interest in this approach to gas conservation was spurred by a desire for a measure that would provide immediate relief to the overstretched budgets of households across America. I was also dusting off a solution used in the past. specifically. the number of barrels of oil saved when a national speed limit was imposed in 1974 in response to the Arab oil embargo. Last week. I was pleased to meet with the GAO and hear their findings on the relationship between vehicular speed and fuel economy as well as how reducing the speed limit might affect fuel use and perhaps cost.

1110069412,"Mr. President. we live in a world that is being poisoned by greenhouse gases of our own making. If we do not act. we face irreversible. catastrophic climate change. My grandchildren face a world where there will be not enough food. water. or fuel. a world that is less diverse. less beautiful. less secure. As I speak today. we are witnessing a critical moment in our fight against global warming both at home and abroad. This past Monday. the Environmental Protection Agency acted by releasing its final determination that ""greenhouse gases threaten the public health and welfare of the American people."" This was an action required by law and ordered by the Supreme Court. This finding will require EPA regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. Mondays endangerment finding is a critical step in our countrys efforts to stop global warming. which not only poses a threat to public health and welfare but to our national security. I am proud of the strong sciencebased actions taken by this administration to live up to its Clean Air Act obligations to protect our health. But I strongly believe that the best way for our country to solve the problem of greenhouse gas emissions is through comprehensive legislation enacted in the Congress of the United States. Legislation that invests in clean energy and new. hightech infrastructure will bring us to longsought goals: energy independence. good jobs for our citizens. and a healthy planet for our children and grandchildren. We are now closer to that kind of legislation than we have ever been. The House has passed a bill that puts a limit on the pollution in our air. It dedicates funding to develop new domestic sources of clean energy. It invests in a new infrastructure that is less dependent on foreign fuels and creates American jobs. And we need those jobs. Here in the Senate. we have improved on our colleagues work. Senate legislation makes additional investments in clean transportation. It provides additional oversight and accountability and support for developing countries. It ensures we do not add one penny to our national deficit. This legislation is consistent with the budget of our country to try to help reduce the deficit and yet make us energy independent. create jobs. and be sensitive to our environment. But because climate change is a global problem. we need a global solution. This past Monday was also an important day in the international effort. The international community began a 2week meeting in Copenhagen. Denmark. to work on an international agreement to address climate change. The international community has set the right objectives to make the meeting a success: a political agreement that promises both immediate action and contains the structure for a future formal treaty. The agreement reached in Copenhagen should include the following points: specific nearterm greenhouse gas emission reduction targetsa critical partthe support the developed countries will provide to the developing world to adapt to a changing industrial economy and a changing climatewe have a responsibility to help the developing worldthe core elements that will make up the final treaty. and a timeline for reaching that agreement within the next year. We cannot put this off. It is critical we act timely. The administration has taken several very important actions over the past few weeks to help us secure a global agreement in Copenhagen. EPAs endangerment finding sends an important signal to the world about the United States commitment to take decisive action. Similarly. the Presidents announcement that the United States will commit to an emissions reduction in the range of 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 and his pledge to contribute the fair share of the United States of $10 billion a year in financial support for the developing world by 2012 demonstrate that we are prepared to be serious partners in the fight against climate change. That is the type of action we want to see. not only in the United States but in other countries that are major emitters. Many of my colleagues. however. have legitimate concerns that if the United States enacts strong carbon standards. carbonintense imports will have an unfair advantage in our market. We need to make sure we accomplish our goals internationally and also have a level playing field. To address this fear. I believe it is critical that our international negotiators include in Copenhagen strong verification and compliance procedures that will make it clear that every state has a responsibility to take action to reduce greenhouse gases. I have seen too many international agreements that include the highest ambitions for labor. environmental. and human rights protections that fail to achieve those goals in the absence of any consequences for violations of those principles. The groundwork for achieving a final international agreement in Copenhagen must ensure that major emitting Nations take on clearly defined emissions reductions targets. adopt standardized systems to measure. report. and verify actions and commitments. and it must provide for consequences if countries fail to meet those commitments. Inclusion of these principles in the Copenhagen agreement allows us to pursue these critical components in any final agreement. and sends an important signal that all party countries are committed to real emissions reductions. I am proud that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee climate change bill introduced by Senator KERRY last week includes language I authored that makes clear our expectations that any international agreement should include strong verification and compliance mechanisms. along with emission reduction targets. and a strong commitment to provide assistance to the developing world. I will be watching the negotiations and hope it will produce the kind of agreement I have discussed here today. But regardless of what Copenhagen brings. I will continue to advocate for domestic legislation that invests in clean. domestic energy. and frees us from energy policies that undermine our national security and our economy by being dependent upon imported oil. I will advocate for legislation that invests in the industries of tomorrow to stem the loss of clean energy jobsjobs that stem from American inventions and ideasto countries overseas. I will advocate for legislation that provides significant investment in clean fuels and public transit. so we seize an opportunity to build the infrastructure of tomorrow and change the way we move people and goods around this country. Right now. the transportation sector represents 30 percent of our greenhouse gas emissions and 70 percent of our oil use. If we could only double the number of transit riders every day. we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil by 40 percent. That is equivalent to the amount of oil we import every year from Saudi Arabia. That kind of legislation is good for our country and good for Maryland. But we must remember that even after Copenhagen. any deals we reach. any papers we sign. are still but the foundation. The work must continue with earnest followthrough. dedicated to truly changing the way we work and live and move around this Earth.",111118121.0,CARDIN,BENJAMIN,S,MD,M,D,,voting,S,2009-12-09,662,Mr. CARDIN,Unknown,CARDIN,Unknown,M,35719,35944,12092009.txt,7226,1164,111,2009,world poison greenhous gase make face irrevers catastroph climat grandchildren face world enough food water fuel world divers beauti wit moment fight global warm home abroad monday environment releas final determin greenhous gase threaten health welfar peopl find epa greenhous emiss clean air monday endanger find effort global warm pose threat health welfar nation proud strong sciencebas taken clean air health strongli believ best way problem greenhous emiss comprehens invest clean energi new hightech infrastructur bring us longsought goal energi independ good job citizen healthi planet children grandchildren closer kind ever limit pollut air dedic fund develop new domest sourc clean energi invest new infrastructur depend foreign fuel job need job improv work make invest clean provid oversight develop ensur penni nation deficit consist tri help deficit make us energi independ job sensit environ climat global problem need global solut monday also import day intern effort intern commun meet copenhagen denmark work intern climat intern commun make meet success polit promis contain structur futur treati reach copenhagen includ point nearterm greenhous emiss targetsa partth develop provid develop world industri economi climatew respons help develop worldth core element make final treati timelin reach next taken import help us global copenhagen epa endanger find import signal world take decis similarli announc emiss rang percent level contribut fair share billion financi develop world demonstr prepar seriou partner fight climat want see emitt concern strong carbon standard carbonintens import advantag market need make sure goal intern also level play field fear believ intern negoti includ copenhagen strong verif complianc make clear respons take greenhous gase seen intern includ highest ambit labor environment human fail achiev goal consequ principl groundwork achiev final intern copenhagen ensur emit nation take clearli emiss target standard measur report verifi provid consequ fail meet inclus principl copenhagen allow us pursu compon final import signal parti real emiss proud foreign relat climat introduc last includ languag author make clear expect intern includ strong verif complianc mechan along emiss target strong provid assist develop world watch negoti produc kind discuss regardless copenhagen bring continu advoc domest invest clean domest energi free us energi polici undermin nation economi depend import advoc invest industri tomorrow stem loss clean energi jobsjob stem invent ideasto oversea advoc provid signific invest clean fuel transit seiz build infrastructur tomorrow way move peopl good around sector repres percent greenhous emiss percent could doubl transit rider day could depend foreign percent equival amount import saudi arabia kind good good even copenhagen deal reach foundat work continu earnest followthrough dedic truli way work move around earth,650,0.30153846153846153,0.22026431718061673
1110026196,Madam Speaker. I rise today to introduce the Energy Efficient and Environmentally Friendly Automobile Tax Credit Act. legislation that will help Americans reduce pollution and the amount they pay for gas. My legislation accomplishes these important goals by providing Americans a tax credit of up to $2.000 when they sell or trade in a car and obtain a vehicle that has at least a 20% higher average fuel economy than the sold or tradedin car. The bill also creates a federal tax deduction for any state or local taxes paid on the purchase of the more fuelefficient automobile and makes interest on loans to purchase the more fuelefficient automobile tax deductible. This legislation will help Americans reduce the amount they pay to fill up their cars by making it easier for them to obtain more fuelefficient cars. I hope my colleagues would agree that Congress should provide free market incentives to make it easier for Americans to exchange their current cars for cars that create less pollution. Providing tax deductions and tax credits to make it easier for Americans to purchase fuelefficient automobiles is a win for American consumers. a win for the7 environment. and a win for those of us who favor free market solutions to pollution and high gas prices. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.,,,,,,,,,,E,2009-03-26,570,Mr. PAUL,Unknown,PAUL,Unknown,M,43997,44026,03262009.txt,1315,220,111,2009,rise introduc energi effici environment friendli automobil credit help pollut amount pay import goal provid credit sell trade car vehicl least higher averag fuel economi sold tradedin car also deduct local purchas fueleffici automobil make interest loan purchas fueleffici automobil deduct help amount pay fill car make easier fueleffici car agre provid free market incent make easier exchang current car car pollut provid deduct credit make easier purchas fueleffici automobil win consum win environ win us favor free market solut pollut high price,125,0.3150684931506849,0.22

1100199797,Madam Speaker. as we all know. the Great Lakes have suffered as a result of years of industrial pollution that entered their waters. Through the Clean Water Act and other important measures we have begun the work necessary to reverse that trend. However. much work needs to be done. The 2007 State of the Great Lakes report recorded the status of the Great Lakes ecosystem as mixed. In other words. the ecosystem displays both good and degraded features. Stopping pollution from entering the water is one thing. Beginning the efforts to restore the ecosystem from the damage it incurred is another. Undoing that damage will require an extensive amount of work. One of the best tools in our arsenal to achieve that goal is the Great Lakes Legacy Act.

1100150186,"of Florida) submitted the following resolution. which was referred to the committee on Health. Education. Labor. and Pensions: S. REs. 509 Whereas the week of April 7th. 2008. is National Public Health Week. and the theme is ""Climate Change: Our Health in the Balance"". Whereas. since 196. the American Public. Health Association. through its sponsorship of National Public Health Week. has educated the public. policymakers. and public health professionals about issues important to improving the publics health. Whereas. according to the World Health Organization (WHO). climate change is a significant and emerging threat to public health and the WHO estimates that humsninduced changes in the Earths climate lead to at least 5.000.000 cases of illness and more than 150.000 deaths each year. Whereas. according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). climate change contributes to the global burden of disease. premature death. and other adverse health impacts due to extreme weather events and changes in infectious disease patterns. air quality. quality and quantity of water and food. ecosystem changes. and economic impacts. Whereas. according to the IPCC. the United States will be challenged by increased heat waves. air pollution. and forest fires during the course of the century. with potential risk for adverse health impacts. such as heat stress and increases in asthma. allergies. and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Whereas the Director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. Julie Gerberding. testified in October 2007 that. ""Climate change is anticipated to have a broad range of impacts on the health of Americans and the nations public health infrastructure"". Whereas. according to the World Health Organization. the negative public health impacts of climate change will likely disproportionately impact communities that are already vulnerable. Whereas these communities include developing countries. young children. the elderly. people with chronic illnesses or otherwise compromised health. people in underserved communities. communities of color. traditional societies. subsistence farmers. and coastal populations. Whereas it is estimated that more than 900.000.000 people worldwide live in slumlike conditions and are particularly vulnerable to the possible health impacts of climate change due to a lack of access to health care. sanitation. and vulnerability to displacement. Whereas future vulnerability to the health. impacts of climate change will depend not only on the degree of climate change the Earth experiences. but also on development and adaptation measures. and Whereas the public health system will be a firstline responder to emergency conditions related to impacts of climate chahge and plays a key role in informing. educating. and empowering local communities: Now. therefore. be it Resolved. That the Senate(1) recognizes ""National Public Health Week"". 1 (2) recognizes the efforts of public health professionals. first responders. States. municipalities. and local communities to incorporate measures to adapt health care systems to address impacts of climate change. (3) recognizes the role of adaptation in preventing impacts of climate change on vulnerable communities. the potential for improvement of health status and health equity through efforts to address climate change. and the need to include health policy in the development of climate responses. (4) encourages further research. interdisciplinary partnership. and collaboration between stakeholders to understand and monitor the health impacts of climate change. for preparedness activities and for improvement of health care infrastructure. and (5) encourages each and every American to learn about the impacts of climate change on health.",,,,,,,,,,S,2008-04-09,172,Mr. NELSON,Unknown,NELSON,Unknown,M,13744,13845,04092008.txt,3806,555,110,2008,florida health labor wherea april nation health theme climat health balanc wherea sinc health associ sponsorship nation health policymak health profession issu import improv health wherea world health climat signific emerg threat health estim humsninduc earth climat lead least case death wherea intergovernment panel climat ipcc climat contribut global burden diseas prematur death advers health impact extrem weather event infecti diseas pattern air qualiti qualiti quantiti water food ecosystem econom impact wherea ipcc challeng increas heat wave air pollut forest fire cours centuri potenti risk advers health impact heat stress increas asthma allergi chronic pulmonari diseas wherea center diseas control gerberd octob climat anticip broad rang impact health nation health infrastructur wherea world health neg health impact climat like disproportion impact commun alreadi vulner wherea commun includ develop young children elderli peopl chronic otherwis compromis health peopl underserv commun commun color tradit subsist farmer coastal popul wherea estim peopl worldwid slumlik condit particularli vulner possibl health impact climat lack access health care sanit vulner displac wherea futur vulner health impact climat depend degre climat earth experi also develop measur wherea health firstlin respond emerg condit relat impact climat chahg play key role inform empow local commun resolv recogn nation health recogn effort health profession first respond municip local commun incorpor measur health care impact climat recogn role impact climat vulner commun potenti improv health health equiti effort climat need includ health polici develop climat respons encourag research interdisciplinari partnership collabor stakehold understand monitor health impact climat prepared improv health care infrastructur encourag learn impact climat health,341,0.20786516853932585,0.2198581560283688

1110056259,"Madam Speaker. ""Electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket."" That is a direct quote from President Obama describing his ""Cap and Trade"" plan. I agree with the President. That is why we call it Cap and Tax. This is a failed European model that should not be imported into the United States. Weve already seen the effects in Europe where household energy prices went up 25% and emissions were not reduced. This is the wrong bill at the wrong time. Imposing a national energy tax on the working families in my district who are already struggling to make ends meet is wrong. And who benefits from this? You guessed it. Wall Street. not Main Street. While I -strongly support investing in alternative energy and green technology. I cannot support this bill. Overall. in my home state of Texas. energy costs will increase by $1.15 billion imposing an enormous tax- each year on every Texas family. All of this for something that simply wont work. Companies that are not able to meet the cap will simply move their manulfacturing facilities overseas to countries with fewer regulations.

We have our proposals and would welcome debate and amendment on others. I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate consider the pending energy speculation measure in the following manner: that the bill be subject to energyrelated amendments only. provided further. that the amendments be considered in an alternating manner between the two sides of the aisle. I further ask consent that the bill remain the pending business to the exclusion of all other business. other than privileged matters or items that are agreed to jointly by the two leaders.

1100172002,Mr. President. I am very disappointed that a minority of Senators blocked the ConsumerFirst Energy Act of 2008. which puts American consumers ahead of big oil companies and other corporate interests. This bill would prevent price gouging and market manipulation from driving up the price of gas. The antiprice gouging language. based on Senator CANTWELLS bill that I cosponsored. would protect consumers from price gouging by sellers and distributors of oil. gasoline. or petroleum distillates during natural disasters and abnormal market disruptions. As a cosponsor of the Oil and Gas Traders Oversight Act. I also strongly support closing loopholes that allow traders using overseas markets to secretively bid up the price. of oil and saddle Americans with the price at the gas pump. Todays vote on the ConsumerFirst Energy Act of 2008 Was an opportunity to stand up to the OPEC cartel and force big oil to pay their fair share. I have long supported the efforts of the senior Senator from Wisconsin to make oilproducing and exporting cartels illegal and make colluding oilproducing nations liable in U.S. court for violations of antitrust law. Our oil companies can also be part of the solution. This bill would have encouraged them to invest in clean. affordable. and domestically produced renewable alternative fuels. expanded refinery capacity and utilization. and renewable electricity production. Last years Renewable Fuels. Consumer Protection. and Energy Efficiency Act of 2007 put our Nations energy policy on a new path: one that encourages renewable energy. conservation of the resources we have. and American innovation. But we have more work to do. and todays vote is a step back in those efforts. I will continue to support both shortand longterm solutions to our Nations energy needs that protect American consumers while working to invest in renewable and alternative energies and break our addiction to oil.,110114121.0,FEINGOLD,RUSSELL,S,WI,M,D,,voting,S,2008-06-10,59,Mr. FEINGOLD,Unknown,FEINGOLD,Unknown,M,2750,2803,06102008.txt,1926,305,110,2008,disappoint minor consumerfirst energi consum ahead big compani corpor interest price goug market manipul drive price antipric goug languag cantwel consum price goug seller distributor gasolin petroleum distil natur disast abnorm market disrupt trader oversight also strongli close loophol allow trader oversea market bid price saddl price pump consumerfirst energi stand opec cartel forc big pay fair share long effort make oilproduc export cartel make collud oilproduc nation us compani also part solut encourag invest clean afford domest produc renew fuel expand refineri capac renew electr product last renew fuel consum energi effici nation energi polici new path encourag renew energi conserv work back effort continu shortand longterm solut nation energi need consum work invest renew energi break addict,184,0.3050847457627119,0.21951219512195122
1110064415,Mr. President. the domestic biofuels producers are in a precarious state. so we asked President Obama to take immediate action to implement the volume mandates for biodiesel. It is in our Nations economic and environmental interest to maintain a robust biodiesel industry. Unfortunately. no action has been taken to immediately implement the volume mandates. Finally. the EPA continues to delay in approving higher blends of ethanol in our transportation fuels. Earlier this year. a number of ethanol producers submitted a request to EPA to allow higher blends of ethanol. Currently. ethanol blends are limited to 10 percent in nonflexfuel vehicles. The waiver request is simply requesting that EPA allow ethanol to be blended at 15 percent levels instead of 10 percent. While the waiver request was submitted back in March. the EPA has not made a decision. The EPAs delay in considering this request is having a negative impact on U.S. ethanol producers and is harming consumers who would otherwise benefit from lower prices at the pump. The delay is also putting off our efforts to use more homegrown renewable fuels in place of imports. The delay is also putting off our efforts to use more homegrown renewable fuels in place of imported fossil fuels. I recognize that prior to approval of higher ethanol blends. the requisite studies and testing must be concluded. A number of scientific studies conducted in recent years confirm that higher ethanol blends do not cause significant changes in tailpipe emissions. vehicle drivability. materials compatibility or durability. It is time to end the delays and take action to further reduce our dependence on foreign oil. I am speaking today to ask President Obama and his staff at the White House to pay close attention to these three issues. Our Nation currently has a strong. renewable fuels infrastructure that is working every day to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Those involved are also working diligently to increase efficiencies and strive toward the second generation of advanced biofuels. But. we cant get there by undermining todays industry. The President can take action within his administration to ensure that no harm is done to the renewable fuels that are displacing dirty fossil fuels today. He can ensure that EPA uses only sound science and avoids speculative assumptions when determining the greenhouse gas emissions of biofuels. He can take action to see that America uses even more homegrown. green energy by ensuring that even more renewable fuel is blended in our Nations transportation mix. And. he can take action to immediately provide the certainty for biodiesel producers that Congress intended in the energy bill of 2007. That is what I am asking him to do. By zeroing in on these three pivotal issues facing the renewable energy effort today. President Obama and his staff can make a major positive difference for the production of even more clean. renewable. domestic biofuels.,111119591.0,GRASSLEY,CHARLES,S,IA,M,R,,voting,S,2009-10-29,637,Mr. GRASSLEY,Unknown,GRASSLEY,Unknown,M,31784,31872,10292009.txt,2967,481,111,2009,domest biofuel produc precari obama take implement biodiesel nation econom environment interest maintain robust biodiesel industri unfortun taken implement final epa continu delay higher blend ethanol fuel ethanol produc epa allow higher blend ethanol current ethanol blend limit percent nonflexfuel vehicl simpli epa allow ethanol blend percent level instead percent back march epa decis epa delay consid neg impact us ethanol produc harm consum otherwis benefit lower price pump delay also effort homegrown renew fuel place import delay also effort homegrown renew fuel place import fossil fuel recogn prior higher ethanol blend conclud scientif confirm higher ethanol blend caus signific tailpip emiss vehicl drivabl compat durabl delay take depend foreign obama white pay close attent three issu nation current strong renew fuel infrastructur work day depend foreign also work increas effici strive toward gener advanc biofuel cant get undermin industri take ensur harm done renew fuel displac dirti fossil fuel ensur epa sound scienc avoid specul assumpt determin greenhous emiss biofuel take see america even homegrown green energi ensur even renew fuel blend nation take provid certainti biodiesel produc intend energi zero three pivot issu face renew energi effort obama make posit product even clean renew domest biofuel,282,0.2962962962962963,0.21929824561403508
1100137719,Mr. President. today I rise to introduce the Technical Corrections to the Clean Air Acts renewable fuels standard. This bill is a measured response to the overly aggressive biofuels increase mandated by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 passed in December. The Energy bills mandates allow no room for error in a fuels industry already constrained by tight supplies. full capacity. environmental regulation. and volatile market conditions. This technical corrections bill is not an effort to substantively overhaul the RFS program but rather is an attempt to smooth its unintended consequences. Recognizing the delicate political balance stirrounding RFS. these simple fixes are intended to provide flexibility for the fuels industry in meeting these mandates. As ranking member on the Environment and Public Works Committee I did not support the 2007 Energy bill. The enactment of these technical corrections would not change my overall opposition to the current flaws enacted to the RFS program. but my bill does make this new RFS less onerous. The first correction to the Clean Air Acts renewable fuels standard allows a carryover of ethanol credits. This improvement does nothing to change the currently mandated numbers. Rather. it provides flexibility to an industry facing many uncertainties. In 2007. the industry used approximately 2 billion gallons of ethanol over and above the necessary levels prescribed in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. EPACT.

1100187259,Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 6515. the Drill Responsibly in Leased Lands (DRILL) Act. I would like to thank the Speaker and the Democratic Leadership for taking action on the urgent and vitally important issue of high fuel prices and energy security. In the face of high gasoline and fuel prices that are creating economic hardship for Americans. it is important that we maximize use of the resources that we have at our disposal today. The DRILL Act does this by requiring oil companies to drill in the 68 million acres of federal lands already leased but sitting idle: Such a measure is an important first step in our countrys energy policy. We have heard many calls from President Bush and our Republican colleagues for opening up new lands for drilling. both in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). Though these may seem like quickfixes to our energy problems. they are misleading and do not. address the problem of high prices and dependence on fossil fuels in the short or longterm. Neither OCS nor ANWR would produce oil for at least the next ten years. Congressional expert projections indicate no significant impact on oil and natural gas prices before 2030. Even then. there is no guarantee that increased production would affect prices at all. Oil prices are determined on an international market. and OPEC could neutralize the effect on oil prices by offsetting any additional supply U.S. oil production brings to the market. The reality is that while we must look for ways to increase our domestic oil production in the shortertermas the DRILL Act does.we cannot drill ourselves out of our energy problems in the longterm. The United States consumes 25 percent of the worlds oil but only holds 3 percent of the worlds known oil reserves. To ensure our countrys security. prosperity. and environmental sustainability we must shift to cleaner sources of energy and increase efficiency in our energy use. Moving to clean. renewable energy sources will enhance our energy independence. bolster our economy through the creation of green jobs. and promote environmental sustainability. Biofuels. wind and solar energy are promising alternatives to oil and coal. and it is vital to invest in research and production incentives for these technologies. At the same time we must increase energy efficiency in our buildings and transportation sector. Most importantly. Americans must think critically and proactively about lifestyle changes that simultaneously preserve the prosperity of our country and promote responsible stewardship of our planet. Mr. Speaker. Americas energy problem is a daunting one. but it is one we can solve if we work together to enact responsible policies for the short and longterm. I urge my colleagues to support the DRILL Act. as it is an important first step in the right direction. In the longterm. we must enact smart. forward looking policies that move us toward cleaner. -sustainable energy and ensure prosperity and a healthy planet for future generations.,,,,,,,,,,E,2008-07-22,637,Ms. MCCOLLUM of Minnesota,Unknown,MCCOLLUM,Minnesota,F,53087,53160,07222008.txt,3057,499,110,2008,rise hr drill respons leas land drill like take urgent vital import issu high fuel price energi face high gasolin fuel price econom hardship import maxim dispos drill compani drill million acr land alreadi leas sit idl measur import first energi polici heard call bush open new land drill outer continent shelf oc arctic nation wildlif refug anwr though seem like quickfix energi problem mislead problem high price depend fossil fuel short longterm neither oc anwr produc least next congression expert project indic signific impact natur price even guarante increas product affect price price determin intern market opec could neutral effect price offset suppli us product bring market realiti look way increas domest product shorterterma drill doesw drill energi problem longterm consum percent world percent world known reserv ensur prosper environment shift cleaner sourc energi increas effici energi move clean renew energi sourc enhanc energi independ bolster economi green job promot environment biofuel wind solar energi promis coal vital invest research product incent technolog increas energi effici build sector importantli proactiv lifestyl simultan preserv prosper promot respons stewardship planet america energi problem daunt work togeth respons polici short longterm drill import first direct longterm smart look polici move us toward cleaner energi ensur prosper healthi planet futur gener,290,0.2594594594594595,0.21897810218978103
1110055928,Madam Speaker. like all of us. I believe we should work to decrease the amount of greenhouse gas emissions in our atmosphere. and we should be good stewards of this Earth and its resources. However. I dont believe this bill will accomplish a dramatic decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. yet I do believe it will have a crippling effect on our economy for years. No matter how you doctor or tailor it. it is a tax. a national energy tax that will hurt each and every household. It will destroy sectors of our economy and cause job losses at an unprecedented rate. Here is a chart that shows the jobs losses in thousands of jobs here. nearly 2 million jobs. 2012. 2035. over 2 million jobs a year. We should be protecting our environment through innovation. through entrepreneurship and cooperation. but this bill tries to cut carbon emissions through punishment taxation. heavy hand of government. and litigation. The bill as originally introduced. analyzed by the PUC. a bipartisan group in Pennsylvania. said it would cost Pennsylvanians 66.000 jobs by the year 2020. I urge my colleagues to consider just how irresponsible it is to move legislation that is going to cost so many jobs. so much damage to our economy. and yet it is anticipated to slow temperature increaseg by only twotenths of 1 degree Fahrenheit by the end of the century.

1110068881,Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 4213. the Tax Extenders Act of 2009. and applaud the leadership of Chairman RANGEL and the Ways and Means Committee in crafting this bill. I commend the Chairman for the inclusion of the alternative fuel tax credit. which incentivizes individuals and businesses to purchase energy for vehicles that run on clean energy sources. This continues Congress commitment to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. As long as we are exporting our dollars overseas in exchange for oil. our economic and national security are at risk. Natural gas is an abundant transition energy that is twice as clean as coal. While 69% of the oil consumed in America is for transportation (twothirds of which we import from foreign nations). 98% of the natural gas we consume is produced in North America. The more than 100 years of natural gas reserves in the U.S. will provide thousands of domestic jobs that cannot be outsourced and will help keep taxpayer dollars in the U.S. Approximately 1.3 million Americans are directly employed by natural gas companies. and the entire U.S. natural gas industry supports nearly three million U.S. jobs. with the potential to add many more. Natural gas will play an increasing role in reducing U.S. carbon emissions. creating jobs. and enhancing U.S. security.

1100190435,Mr. President. many economists believe energy efficiency and conservation are absolutely critical to our efforts to reduce our reliance on foreign oil. I agree. We have passed major energy legislation in the past to promote research and development in the area of hybrid automobile research. including batteries. We will be holding a hearing tomorrow in the Joint Economic Committee on this issue. Clearly. we need to conserve more. We have two hybrid vehicles in my family. and it has worked well. We need to move that technology forward. But it doesnt change the fundamentals that we have to produce more here as well. I want to show a final chart of the oil shale area in the United States. It is currently off limits from drilling. It has the potential of 500 billionor morebarrels in production. This is in Wyoming. Utah. and Colorado. Clearly. this is another area we need to open for development. My point is that we are not helpless and we can do more. We have to do it now. Time is of the essence. It is draining peoples pocketbooks. and it is putting us in an unnecessary security risk. I am hopeful that the leader is going to allow us to put forward amendments. I hope we can put forward our flex fuel amendment. I hope we can put forward drilling amendments so that we can get production up in the United States. That is something we need to do.

1110048466,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. this amendment will protect intellectual property rights. or IPR. for American businesses by ensuring robust compliance with international legal iPR requirements and the enforcement of those requirements related to energy and 6nvironmental technologies. Congressman KiRK from Illinois and I recently returned from China where we met both with Chinese leadership and American companies doing business in China. Among a number of issues that we heard on the trip. two were consistent during our meetings with the American businesses. First. there is a great deal of enthusiasm regarding the interest in energy and climate change cooperation between the U.S. and China. Second. however. is a concern that the intellectual property rights owned by those companies selling their cleanenergy technologies in China and other parts of the world will not be protected. and the green jobs that could be created here at home will be lost. According to the International En-. ergy Agency. the world needs to invest $45 trillion in energy in the coming decades to cut in half greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. To meet that goal. glean technology innovation must increase by 100 to 1.000 percent. The global market for environmental products and services is projected to double from $1.37 trillion per year at present to $2.74 trillion by 2020. And according to the American Solar Energy Society. by 2003. industries with green collar jobs could provide up to 40 million American jobs and generate up to $4.53 trillion in annual revenue. IPR protection gives companies theconfidence to invest in critical research and development efforts to meet the growing demand for cleanenergy technology. For this reason. Congressman KIRK and I have offered this amendment to H.R. 2410 to protect the IPR of these clean technologies and ensure these green jobs stay right here in the United States. It is critical that the investments that American companies are making in clean technology are protected. Protecting individual property rights will help us reward innovation instead of penalizing it. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment to H.R. 2410. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.,111120150.0,LARSEN,RICK,H,WA,M,D,2.0,voting,H,2009-06-10,519,Mr. LARSEN of Washington,Unknown,LARSEN,Washington,M,41514,41578,06102009.txt,2252,360,111,2009,consum intellectu ipr ensur robust complianc intern legal ipr enforc relat energi nvironment technolog congressman kirk china chines compani china among issu heard trip two consist meet first great deal enthusiasm regard interest energi climat us china concern intellectu own compani sell cleanenergi technolog china part world green job could home intern ergi world need invest trillion energi come decad cut half greenhous emiss meet goal glean technolog increas percent global market environment product project doubl trillion per trillion solar energi industri green collar job could provid million job gener trillion annual ipr give compani theconfid invest research develop effort meet grow cleanenergi technolog congressman kirk hr ipr clean technolog ensur green job invest compani make clean technolog individu help us reward instead penal hr reserv balanc,200,0.3409090909090909,0.21839080459770116

1100155028,Mr. Speaker. the United States is at a crucial point in terms of domestic energy production. With estimates that China and India combined will consume more energy than the United States by 2015. we must take a serious look at our domestic energy production and continue to reduce our dependence on Middle Eastern oil. Chinas increasing offshore energy production to reduce its own dependence on foreign oil. growing their production an average of 15.3 percent per year with plans to make offshore production Chinas largest source of oil by doubling production by 2010. The current congressional leadership. opposes domestic offshore energy exploration and production. making America the only developed nation in the world to restrict access to offshore energy supplies. China has invested $24 billion in coal liquefaction technology. while current congressional leadership -continues to exclude coal from their energy policy. even though it is the most abundant and efficient fuel source found in the United States.

1110066754,"Madam Speaker. I am introducing the ""Energy Efficiency Modernization Act of 2009."" to establish market incentives so that federally assisted housing can become more energy efficient. Federally assisted housing programs provide real opportunities for green improvements. However. existing rules and regulations make it difficult for owners of federally assisted housing to maximize efforts and decrease our Nations energy bill. A 2008 study by the Government Accountability Office found that the Department of Housing and Urban Development spends an estimated $5 billion annually on energy costs to pay for roughly 6 million units of housing. representing almost 17 percent of the Nations rental housing stock. Improving the energy efficiency of federally assisted housing by 25 to 40 percent would result in savings for HUD at roughly $1 billion to $1.5 billion annually. making the longterm cost savings for the Federal Governmentand. most importantly. taxpayerssubstantial.

1110005054,Act II helps address these challenges. Just as it is important to have diversity in our forests. it is also important to maintain diversity in our forestry industfy. and we must ensure that all business forms have the necessary tools so they can be successful in the global marketplace. Timber companies that are organized as corporations continue to be under intensifying pressure to reorganize. In that case. a corporation that owns substantial manufacturing facilities would be forced to sell some of those facilities and* to make other structural changes in order to comply -with the relevant tax rules that it would newly become subject to. This would likely cause disruptions in many of these communities and would also make it harder for U.S. companies to compete internationally.

1110074347,Mr. President. I want to speak briefly as the Copenhagen conference on climate change approaches its final hours. Earlier this week. Secretary of State Clinton announced on behalf of the United States the intention to work with other governments to raise $100 billion in longterm financing by 2020 to help developing countries address global climate change. This is an important commitment and an essential part of any comprehensive approach to global warming. If the United States is to play a leading role in addressing climate change. we must provide not only strong policies and resources here at home in our factories and on our farms. but also help poor countries adapt to rising sea levels and temperatures which affect agricultural productivity. and to reduce their own emissions of the greenhouse gases that affect every American as well as billions of others across the globe. The United States has been historically the major emitter of C02. and we clearly have a responsibility to help address this global problem. Those who suggest otherwise ignore history. But this is a winwin situation: By exporting U.S. clean energy technology and expertise. we will also generate jobs here at home. help other countries reduce their emissions in a transparent. verifiable and accountable manner. and help to avoid the worst effects of global warming. Other nations. particularly China and India. are also major contributors to global warming. The administration is right to insist that they be part of the solution and agree to verifiable limits on their own greenhouse gas emissions. It is encouraging that China is already a major investor in renewable energy technology. but at the same time is building coalfired powerplants at an alarming rate. For the past 8 years. the policy of the Bush administration was to ignore this problem. In fact it was worse than that. as the last administration actively sought to discredit the scientific evidence and oppose any efforts both here and abroad to address global warming with anything more than lipservice. Fortunately. times have changed. We have a President and a Congress that are committed to developing a strategy to invest in clean energy. energy efficiency and new hightech infrastructure that will bring us to longsought goals: energy independence. good jobs for our citizens. and a healthy planet for our children and grandchildren. The recently passed fiscal year 2010 Department of State. Foreign Operations. and Related Programs Appropriations Act provides more than $1.2 billion for climate change and environment programs overseas. This is a significant increase over last year. From exports of renewable energy technology to programs to protect tropical forests. these funds will play a part in our bilateral and multilateral efforts to work collectively with other countries. This and Secretary Clintons announcement are important steps. but the relentless burning of fossil fuels and destruction of the worlds remaining forests call for nothing less than unprecedented commitments to reverse these trends. There is already speculation that Copenhagen will fall far short of what is needed. I am hopeful that before the conference concludes the Obama administration will demonstrate further that the U.S. is going to do what is necessary so future generations will not look back and ask why we failed when faced with this great challenge.,111120181.0,LEAHY,PATRICK,S,VT,M,D,,voting,S,2009-12-18,257,Mr. LEAHY,Unknown,LEAHY,Unknown,M,13964,14061,12182009.txt,3405,540,111,2009,want briefli copenhagen climat approach final clinton announc behalf work rais billion longterm financ help develop global climat import part comprehens approach global warm play lead role climat provid strong polici home factori farm also help poor rise sea level temperatur affect agricultur product emiss greenhous gase affect well billion globe histor emitt c clearli respons help global problem suggest otherwis histori winwin situat export us clean energi technolog expertis also gener job home help emiss transpar verifi help avoid worst effect global warm nation particularli china india also contributor global warm insist part solut agre verifi limit greenhous emiss encourag china alreadi investor renew energi technolog build coalfir powerpl alarm rate polici bush problem fact wors last sought discredit scientif evid oppos effort abroad global warm lipservic fortun develop strategi invest clean energi energi effici new hightech infrastructur bring us longsought goal energi independ good job citizen healthi planet children grandchildren fiscal depart foreign relat program provid billion climat environ program oversea signific increas last export renew energi technolog program tropic forest fund play part bilater multilater effort work collect clinton announc import relentless burn fossil fuel destruct world forest call unpreced revers trend alreadi specul copenhagen fall far short need conclud obama demonstr us necessari futur gener look back fail face great challeng,297,0.2463768115942029,0.21794871794871795

They currently produce energy at almost 4 cents a kilowatt hour. Under the proposals that they are examining. which are led by the Democrats. they believe their costs will go to 11.8 cents a kilowatt hour. That doesnt mean just in the vacuum. But take your electric bill that you pay this month. or the one you pay in July when it is really high because of air conditioning. and multiply it by 21/2.

1110041930,I appreciate your comments. Were already seeingsome of the effects in our oil and gas energy sector in the State of Oklahoma of job losses already just by talking- about the capandtrade piece of .egislation. And you were mentioning a few moments ago about the pollution of other countries and how if we have cap and trade here and we try to control our emissionswhich we should. we should have reasonable policy on thathow China and India and some of those other growing economies will still keep polluting. In fact. a statistic that I saw said twothirds of the worlds population comes from countries other than the United States. So. while we may put some heavy restrictionsr that could cost jobs and investment in the United States. these other countries will take those market shares from us and continue polluting. I was interested in your comments by Secretary Geithner who said we have an overproduction of our oil. which that is an unusual comment when our Nation is so dependent upon foreign energy. I think many of us in .this body believe that our country is at risk in our national security and economic security by buying almost 70 percent65. 70 percent of our energy supplies from other foreign countries while spending around $700 billion buying that foreign energy. Just think what that $700 billionif we pioduced our own energywhat that would do in our Nation as it relates to jobs and investment in our marketplace here in the United States.. But yet we continue to send that money to foreign countries buying their energy versus encouraging innovation. free enterprise here in United States of all kinds of energy sources. And I just truly believe we have the knowledge. we have the capacity and the intellect in the United States to develop these alternative means of fuel and to reduce our carbon emissions.

1100209841,Yes. I have long admired the work of Senator ALLARD in forming and developing the caucus over the years. I am honored to be chosen as the next cochair of the caucus and am eager to build on the work he has accomplished thus far. As you mentioned. my home State of Idaho is one of the Nations leaders in renewable energy. Idaho has significant and developed hydropower. wind. and geothermal energy resources. which has led us to have one of the five lowest per capita and total emissions profiles of any State. The research being done on these technologies. as well as energy efficiency. biofuels. and alternative energy resources such as nuclear power at the Idaho National Laboratory. University of Idaho. Boise State and Idaho State Universities. is remarkable and nationally recognized. Energy issues have arrived at center stage in the public eye and energy supply. prices. and environmental effects are at the forefront of concern. All of us here. regardless of political affiliation. can agree that developing a sound domestic energy plan that provides an adequate supply of clean and affordable energy is a benefit to our Nation.

1100158704,Mr. President today more than ever. credit unions are a critical component of our nations financial landscape. At a time when most financial institutions are retreating from the credit markets. credit unions are among the few lenders in the financial industry demonstrating resiliency and strength. For example. while many mortgage lenders are struggling to stay afloat. the delinquency rate on mortgages issued by credit unions is less than one percent. and credit unions are still lending. Nonetheless. certain outdated regulatory rules impede the ability of credit unions to effectively carry out their role as savings and lending institutions for local communities and small businesses. Because I believe that credit unions are a stabilizing force in the domestic economy and play an important role in providing financial services to local community and underserved groups.

1110040685,Madam Speaker. I am submiting this statement to express congratulations to Caterpillar. Inc. for their receiving EPAs Clean Air Excellence Award: Caterpillar was honored for developing its D7E. a revolutionary new bulldozer that consumes up to 30 percent less fuel and performs necessary construction operations 25 percent more efficiently. These impressive increases in efficiency will allow construction workers. miners and other earthmoving workers to do their jobs while emitting significantly fewer carbon dioxide emissions. After more than two years of research. the D7E represents exactly the kinds of new technology we need to move our country and our economy into the 21st Century. Its electric drive is a platform from which Caterpillar can begin exploring the possible use of alternative fuels to power American construction. Production of these innovative tractors is set to begin later this year in my home state of Illinois. As a former small businessman myself. and one who worked to keep manufacturing jobs in the Midwest. I would like to further congratulate Caterpillar for its commitment to reinvest in the Communities that have supported them for nearly 100 years.

Sharks are vital to the health of marine ecosystems. but the practice of shark finning is driving the decline of their populations worldwide. Nine years ago. Congress passed the Shark Finning Prohibition Act to protect these important species. The pending measure reconfirms the original intent of Congress to prevent shark finning by prohibiting the removal of fins at sea and the possession. transfer or landing of fins. which are not naturally attached to the corresponding carcass. Reducing shark finning is imperative to conserving sharks. a critical species within marine ecosystems. This bill passed the House during the last Congress but was not acted upon by the other body. Today. we are repeating our effort for this important conservation. I especially want to acknowledge the efforts of MADELEINE BORDALLO. the Chair of the Insular Affairs Oceans and Wildlife subcommittee. She has worked hard on this.

1100207875,Mr. President. I rise to enter into a colloquy with my good friend Senator BAUCUS. the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Finance. I wish to address section 115 of the bill. which provides a tax credit for carbon dioxide sequestration. Specifically. in section 115 of the bill. new section 45Q(d)(2) of the code provides that the Secretary of the Treasury. in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. shall establish regulations for determining adequate security measures for the geological storage of carbon dioxide to qualify for the $20 per ton credit. such that the carbon dioxide does not escape into the atmosphere or affect underground sources of drinking water. Carbon dioxide sequestration in this provision includes storage at deep saline formations and unminable coal seems under such conditions as the Secretary may determine under these regulations. Is my understanding correct that the legislation is intended to require that EPA. in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury regarding the carbon sequestration tax credit under this provision. will establish the specific substantive environmental criteria and requirements for security and other measures for the geologic storage of carbon dioxide such that it does not escape into the atmosphere or affect underground sources of drinking water. and that the Secretary of the Treasury will then apply such criteria and requirements in establishing the requirements to qualify for the tax credit under this section?,110118701.0,BOXER,BARBARA,S,CA,F,D,,voting,S,2008-10-01,313,Mrs. BOXER,Unknown,BOXER,Unknown,F,15562,15612,10012008.txt,1528,233,110,2008,rise enter good baucu distinguish financ wish provid credit carbon dioxid sequestr new qd provid consult environment establish determin measur geolog storag carbon dioxid per ton credit carbon dioxid escap atmospher affect underground sourc drink water carbon dioxid sequestr provis includ storag deep salin format unmin coal seem condit determin understand intend epa consult regard carbon sequestr credit provis establish substant environment criteria measur geolog storag carbon dioxid escap atmospher affect underground sourc drink water appli criteria establish credit,124,0.3698630136986301,0.21739130434782608

1100138961,I thank the chairman for yielding and for his leadership on this and so many other issues. Mr. Speaker. as a former utility company attorney. I rise in strong support of this important legislation which will help our Nation and my home State of Nevada to move towards a cleaner. more sustainable energy future. I am very proud of my State of Nevada. Our legislature has passed a renewable energy portfolio. It mandates that by the year 2015. 20 percent of the power sold to Nevadans must be produced from renewables. Energy providers in the State of Nevada have built or planned half a dozen major solar power projects in order to meet this requirement. And thats just solar. There is also wind. geothermal. and countless other projects that can and will help lessen our dependence on fossil fuel with the passage of this bill. This bill provides substantial tax incentives for energy produced from renewable resources. including wind. including solar. geothermal. biomass. many other possibilities. These incentives will provide badly needed assistance to companies that are working hard to diversify our energy resources. improve the economy by creating green jobs. and clean up the air we breathe and our environment. I believe energy independence is an economic issue. an environmental issue. and a national security imperative. Mr. Speaker. it is time that our Nation stop depending on corrupt dictators. and nations that finance and support terrorists and terrorism around the planet to satisfy our energy needs. We pay exor1itant prices for foreign oil from countries who support and encourage terrorist activities around the world: We must stop funding both sides of this war on terror. By encouraging the development of renewable energy and energy independence. this bill helps move this country in the right direction. $102 for a barrel of oil is reason enough for everybody in this body to support this bill. This package is good for Nevada. Its good for our  Nation.,110116620.0,BERKLEY,SHELLEY,H,NV,F,D,1.0,voting,H,2008-02-27,167,Ms. BERKLEY,Unknown,BERKLEY,Unknown,F,10094,10149,02272008.txt,1979,326,110,2008,issu compani rise strong import help nation home move toward cleaner energi futur proud renew energi portfolio percent sold nevadan produc renew energi provid built plan half dozen solar project meet that solar also wind geotherm countless project help lessen depend fossil fuel provid incent energi produc renew includ wind includ solar geotherm biomass possibl incent provid badli need assist compani work hard diversifi energi improv economi green job clean air breath environ believ energi independ econom issu environment issu nation imper nation depend corrupt nation financ terrorist terror around planet satisfi energi need pay exorit price foreign encourag terrorist around world fund side war terror encourag develop renew energi energi independ help move direct barrel enough everybodi packag good good nation,182,0.3252032520325203,0.21686746987951808
1100205392,Mr. Speaker. Chairman OBERSTAR has been a great leader in the transportation issues of our country. and certainly one of the leaders in rail transportatioji policy. but I would just like to say on this bill that one of the goals of the rail transportation policy of the United States is to ensure the development of a sound rail system to meet the needs of shippers and the consuming public. I am genuinely concerned that H.R. 6707 may actually have an adverse impact on our rail system. particularly as -it relates to rural communities. In rural areas of our country. at one time we had strong railroad service which contributed a great deal to the economic development in rural America. I am very much concerned that this legislation. while it has every good intention of prqtecting local communities. will actually be a chill to continued rail service in a lot of small communities. The Rail Transportation Safety Board already is required to look. on rail mergers and acquisitions. to look at the public interest standard and must evaluate that. I am just concerned that this additional requirement will really be a chilling effect and will adversely impact rail service in rural America which will have an adverse impact on all of us. particularly at this time when energy prices. being as high as they are. we know that we can transport goods by rail cheaper which makes us more competitive in the global marketplace. For that reason. I would respectfully oppose this legislation.,110118080.0,WHITFIELD,ED,H,KY,M,R,1.0,voting,H,2008-09-27,444,Mr. WHITFIELD of Kentucky,Unknown,WHITFIELD,Kentucky,M,32976,33018,09272008.txt,1486,253,110,2008,oberstar great leader issu certainli leader rail transportatioji polici like goal rail polici ensur develop sound rail meet need shipper consum genuin concern hr advers impact rail particularli relat commun area strong railroad contribut great deal econom develop america concern good prqtect local commun chill continu rail small commun rail safeti alreadi look rail merger acquisit look interest standard evalu concern realli chill effect advers impact rail america advers impact us particularli energi price high know good rail cheaper make us competit global marketplac respect oppos,132,0.3181818181818182,0.21666666666666667
1110072002,Mr. Speaker. this morning. listeners to NPR Marketplace heard the insurance industry dealing with the problems of global warming. Extreme weather events. actually. is why they were concerned. That term global warming actually means drought. flood. heat waves. intense storms. breaking seasonal patterns. In my region of the Pacific northwest. it means long. slow trends. like the increase in spring temperatures over the last 70 years. that lead to a significant decline in the snow pack that we rely upon for drinking water and hydropower. As our congressional delegation heads to Copenhagen this week to join with parliamentarians from around the world. we will be able to be involved with a critical discussion on how we are going to meet those challenges. Our delegation is going to be somewhat unique because. while other groups of parliamentarians in other countries are of different parties and disagree on the best solution to deal with climate change and extreme weather events. ours. with the possible exception of Saudi Arabia. will be the only one where there are some people who actually question the science and the need for action. This is unfortunate. because the facts are clear. Even regarding the recent dust up over stolen emails of some of the climate scientists. it doesnt change the scientific consensus that we are involved in a period of significant global warming and that human activity is the cause. Despite some dispute over whether this year is the fourth. fifth or sixth warmest in history. there is no question but that the current decade will be the hottest since we began recording temperatures. Even with the consensus on science. there still is a great deal of real controversy in Copenhagen about how we are going to move forward. I think its very important for us to highlight the encouraging dynamic that is taking shape. because there is a consensus for taking action. The question is in implementation both of speed and scale. There is good news that the United States is no longer missing in action. As the worlds largest economy. the second largest emitter this year and still the leader in the history of the world in total emissions. its important that the United States finally joins with the rest of the developed world to deal with this question. It is encouraging that the Obama administration and the new Congress has been acting from the very beginning of this session of Congress with an $80 billion investment in clean energy. After years of delay. the Obama administration acted on what we passed in the last Congress to increase the long overdue improvement in automobile fuel efficiency. The EPA has finally announced that it is going to follow the law dealing with carbon pollution. as the Bush administration was directed by the Supreme Court but refused to do. We have had the historic passage of the WaxmanMarkey legislation. for the first time in history putting Congress on record supporting comprehension climate legislation. The administration will use the House bill as the basis for targeted reductions in greenhouse gases. We have emerging in the Senate a bipartisan framework with Senator KERRY. Senator LIEBERMAN and Senator GRAHAM providing the leadership in that area. Its exciting to see the pieces come together. Mr. Speaker. It is frustrating to see it slow. and time is of the essence. but finally its clear that action is in everybodys interest. The United States can no longer afford to waste more energy than anybody in the world. Its exciting to see the European Union. China and India all acting. at least in their own way. moving in this direction. The dominos are falling for new. clean. energy economies. managing forests to protect the planet and new sustainable agriculture. All this will happen. The question is when. I am encouraged that in Copenhagen there is a process that the United States can help move us forward.,111118640.0,BLUMENAUER,EARL,H,OR,M,D,3.0,voting,H,2009-12-15,3,Mr. BLUMENAUER,Unknown,BLUMENAUER,Unknown,M,142,257,12152009.txt,3906,652,111,2009,morn npr marketplac heard insur industri deal problem global warm extrem weather event concern term global warm mean drought flood heat wave intens storm break season pattern region pacif northwest mean long slow trend like increas temperatur last lead signific snow pack reli drink water hydropow congression copenhagen around world discuss meet challeng somewhat uniqu group parti disagre best solut deal climat extrem weather event possibl except saudi arabia peopl scienc need unfortun fact clear even regard dust stolen email climat scientist doesnt scientif consensu period signific global warm human caus disput whether warmest histori current decad hottest sinc temperatur even consensu scienc great deal real controversi copenhagen move import us highlight encourag dynam take shape consensu take implement speed scale good news longer world largest economi largest emitt leader histori world total emiss import final rest develop world deal encourag obama new billion invest clean energi delay obama last increas long overdu improv automobil fuel effici epa final announc deal carbon pollut bush direct refus histor waxmanmarkey first histori comprehens climat basi target greenhous gase emerg bipartisan framework lieberman provid area excit see piec come togeth frustrat see slow essenc final clear everybodi interest longer afford energi anybodi world excit see european union china india least way move direct domino fall new clean energi economi forest planet new agricultur happen encourag copenhagen help move us,336,0.27848101265822783,0.21637426900584794
1100197560,I appreciate this opportunity. Mr. Speaker. unfortunately an amendment that I proposed was shut out by the Democratic majority regarding renewal energy projects on public lands. As you know. Nevada is on the forefront of a renewable energy. We have the third largest solar facility in the world in my district. I have made some suggestions. so I have had to drop my own bill. since the leadership would not allow this to be heard. to ensure that when leasing or buying Federal lands. developers of renewable energy shall be able to lease or buy the property at existing fair market value. It would expedite the process. We want to make sure if there is a solar or geothermal facility or wind or. whatever alternative energy. it is an expedited process. It would direct the Secretary of the Interior to expedite these applications for renewable energy. direct the Secretary to also prioritize Federal land across the country. which could be used for renewable energy projects. and by local governments. It directs the Secretary to identify all Federal lands around the country that are suitable and feasible for alternative projects. Its unfortunate this would not be heard by the majority party. This is something that is important to move this process along. Mr. Speaker. Congress needs to act now to encourage the development of renewable resources on Federal lands. but as always bureaucracy and red tape are interfering with the process. I am proud to introduce legislation that will remove regulatory and bureaucratic delays that are impeding the development of renewable energy projects on available Federal lands in resource rich states like my home state of Nevada. According to the Department of Intendr. there are currently 210 solar energy applications pending with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and 217 applications pending with the BLM for wind energy projects. My legislation would help alleviate the bureaucratic hurdles and delays and streamline the application process needed to move renewable energy projects forward as we seek to address the current energy crisis. My legislation will also: Ensure that when leasing or buying Federal lands. developers of renewable energy projects shall be able to lease or buy the public land at the existing value fair market value. not the price of the land once the plant is built and improvements are made. Expedite an efficient process for the submission and consideration of renewable energy projects. Direct the Secretary of Interior to expedite all those applications for renewable energy projects currently in the logjam of bureaucratic delays. Direct the Secretary to prioritize Federal land transfers for renewable energy projects to local governments. and Direct the Secretary to identify all Federal lands around the country that are suitable and feasible for alternative energy projects. A brief reminder of why renewable energy development is important to the Nation: The economic impact of new renewable energy projects is immensehundreds of thousands of jobs to develop and operate these power plants. bringing new tax dollars into rural communities. where unemployment is high and a boost to the local economies are sorely needed. Renewable power plants reduce the Nations dependence on fossil fuels and imports. enhancing our national security. improving our balance of payments. and stimulating our economy. Renewable power plants improve our environment. reducing greenhouse gases and clearing our air. .

1110058770,Without objection. it is so ordered. The amendment. as modified. was agreed to. as follows: At the appropriate place. insert the following: Findings: Sudden loss in late 2008 of exportmarket based demand equivalent to about three percent of domestic milk production has thrown the U.S. dairy industry into a critical supplydemand imbalance. and An abrupt decline in U.S. exports was fueled by the onset of the global economic crisis combined with resurgence of milk supplies in Oceania. and The U.S. average allmilk price reported by the National Agriculture Statistics Service from January through May of 2009. has averaged $4.80 per hundredweight below the cost of production. and Approximately $3.9 billion in dairy producer equity has been lost since January. and Anecdotal evidence suggests that U.S. dairy producers are losing upwards of $100 per cow per month. and The Food. Conservation. and Energy Act of 2008 extended the countercyclical Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) support program and instituted a feed cost adjuster to augment that support. and The Secretary of Agriculture in March transferred approximately 200 million pounds of nonfat dry milk to USDAs food and Nutrition Service in a move designed to remove inventory from the market and support lowincome families. and The Secretary on March 22nd reactivated USDAs Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) to help U.S. producers meet prevailing world prices and develop international markets. and The Secretary announced on July 31. 2009 a temporary increase in the amount paid for dairy products through the Dairy Product Price Support Program (DPPSP). an adjustment that is projected to increase dairy farmers revenue by $243 million. and U.S. dairy producers face unprecedented challenges that threaten the stability of the industry. the nations milk production infrastructure. and thousands of rural communities.

Today the House is set to consider the first comprehensive climate program in the- history of the House of Representatives. and I support H.R. This bill represents efforts to reach a consensus across our diverse membership and produce legislation that seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions both at home but also abroad. If Congress does nothing. greenhouse gas emissions could be regulated administratively through the EPA without input from Members that represent diverse constituencies nationwide.

These energyintensive industries could be left vulnerable to foreign competitors not facing carbon regulations if we do ndt carefully craft transitional policies to prevent job loss and strengthen U.S. industries at home. I want to thank Congressman INSLEE and Congressman DOYLE for putting. forth a proposal to provide 15 percent of the free allowances to emissionintensive industries to address competitive concerns. especially in the chemical industry. If a manufacturing facility is energy intensive and trade exposed. allowances will be provided to that facility on a production output basis. providing. rebates for both the direct and indirect costs of complying with the climate program. These rebates will level the playing field relative to imports while encouraging emission reductions. The bill also helps protects the U.S. domestic refining industry while creating a climatechange program. Oulr domestic refiners will face a .competitive disadvantage with foreign dompetitors that are not subject to carbon regulations. U.S. refiners in this bill will receive 2 percent of the allowances starting in 2014 and ending in 2026. plus an additional .25 percent for small business refiners. Thats over onehalf of the projected 4 percent of refined emissions. This funding will help defray expenses associated with direct and indirect costs and their stationary source of emissions under the cap as well as help improve the efficiency of refineries through technical and feedstock changes.

1100154378,"Mr. President. Earth Day has been celebrated on April 22 every year since 1970. Much has changed since then. Americans have grown increasingly aware of importance of environmental stewardship for the wellbeing of our country. New challenges have emerged. though. that we didnt recognize in 1970. New sources of pollution threaten our air and water. In recent weeks. for instance. we have been reminded that there are chemicals and pharmaceuticals entering our waters whose effects on the environment are largely unknown. Perhaps our most important challenge perhaps the greatest problem mankind has ever facedis global warming. Disruptive climate change threatens our ecosystems. our national security. and our economy. Landmark laws such as the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act have done much to protect America. Now. though. our generation is being asked to step up to save our planet as a whole. The science is unequivocal: global warming is real and manmade greenhouse gases are the root cause. The scientific debate is over. and the time for action is at hand. Congress is taking this responsibility seriously. Several bills have been introduced in the 110th Congress that would attempt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Among them is Americas Climate Security Act. the bill crafted by Senators Lieberman and Warner. The LiebermanWarner bill has the potential to reduce Americas total greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent by 2020 and 66 percent by 2050 compared to 2005 levels. These cuts would restore U.S. leadership in international climate change negotiations and help avoid the worst consequences of global warming. There is* no doubt. We need to start cutting greenhouse gases now. What have we heard from the White House on this? Last week. President Bush said Americas goal should be to start to reduce the rate of greenhouse gas emissions by 2025. Representative EDWARD MARKEY. chairman of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming. described the plan this way. The Presidents shortterm plan for global warming is: Do nothing. His intermediate plan is: Do nothing much. And his longterm plan is: Do nothing close to what is required to avoid global catastrophe. The White House plan is not nearly good enough. As global warming progresses we can expect more coastal flooding. more inland -droughts and wildfires. more severe storms. more global water and food crises. and more stress on species and habitats that are already at risk for survival. A White House policy of ""business as usual""-of continuing to allow greenhouse gas emissions at an unchecked. accelerating pacewill sentence America to an increasing number of catastrophescatastrophes that will be costly in terms of dollars and of human life and health. We in Congress have another choicethe choice to honestly debate a rational plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enacting laws that protect our planet and Americas future. The founders of Earth Day created a legacy that lives with us today. Americans recognize that our wellbeing is founded on a clean and healthy environment. We have seen much improvement in the environmental stewardship shown by our nations citizens and industry. Congress can be proud of the role it has played. too. Today. on this Earth Day. America is faced with a new set of environmental challenges.

1110048736,I am so pleased to join my fellow Green Dogs to talk about the subject. I couldnt help but pick up. if I may. to our friend from New York. Mr. TONKO. the point he was making about the power of research and development. R&D dollars. in innovative technology. Lets just take the potential power of the advanced battery research. What could that do? Well. in the automotive industry. advanced lithium batteries. for example. could get you plugin hybrid vehicles that get an average equivalent of 100 miles per gallon. If every vehicle in America got an average of 100 miles per gallon. you would almost wipe out the need for any imported oil in the United States of America. It is not science fiction. It is around the corner. but it needs an extra investment. It is an investment with an enormous potential return that would more than return dollars to U.S. taxpayers and. of course. contribute to the economy. Similarly. advanced battery research is desperately needed to essentially bring the solar industry in the United States to that next step. What we lack in solar right now is the ability to really store the sun. And if we could have a breakthrough. and. again. it is not rocket science. it is not science fiction. if we could have a breakthrough in advanced battery research so that we can extend storage capacity. so on sunny days we can store that energy on overcast days. especially in climates that arent as warm as. say. the Southwest where our friend Mr. HEINRICH comes from in New Mexico. we could absolutely transform the solar industry and make it a practical either supplement or alternative for households and businesses all across the United States. What could that do in terms of job creation and reviving the manufacturing sector of the United States?

This resolution declares the week of June 15 through June 19. 2009. as HighPerformance Building Week. According to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. a highperformance building is defined as a building that integrates and optimizes on a lifecycle basis all major highperformance attributes including energy conservation. environment. safety. security. durability. accessibility. costbenefit productivity. sustainability. functionality. and operational considerations. It is important to focus on making our buildings highperformance buildings for many reasons. some of which are that our homes. offices. schools. and other buildings consume 40 percent of the primary energy and 70 percent of the electricity used in the United States annually. that buildings consume about 12 percent of the potable water in this country. and that construction of buildings and the related infrastructure consume approximately 60 percent of all raw materials used in the United .States economy. Madam Speaker. I could go on. but I think you get the point. There are a lot of efficiencies to be gained by focusing on highperformance buildings. and the benefits to our society are great. Again. I commend cochairs CARNAHAN and BIGGERT for their leadership and hope that my colleagues will see the value that awareness of the benefits of the highperformance buildings will bring and support this. resolution: With that.

1110056589,Madam Speaker. the U.S. House of Representatives today passed H.R. 2454. the socalled Cap and Trade bill. I noted in opposition to that measure and offer the following statement. The Cap and Tax bill could not come at a worse time and could be a job killer. The 1.200 page measure will impose a national tax on ALL energy and lead to higher energy prices for ALL American households. Most families cannot afford the estimated $1.400 yearly increase in energy costs. With the economy struggling. this bill. with its increased expense to industry. will cause additional unemployment by sending jobs overseas where doing business is cheaper. This bill alsofurther expands the role of government.by imposing new restrictions and requirements on everything from light bulbs to water dispensers. As the Republican Leader of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. I want to point out that Transportation accounts for 30% of greenhouse gas emissions. This legislation contains significant provisions in the committees jurisdiction. yet we held -no hearings on this massive tax increase. and willingly surrendered our responsibility to consider any amendments to try to improve the bill. According to the Heritage Foundation. by 2035 this Cap and Trade bill would: reduce aggregate gross GDP by $9.4 trillion (or reduce Florida gross state product by $28 billion). raise electricity rates 90 percent. raise gasoline prlces by 58 percent. raise residential natural gas prices by 55 percent. and Increase inflationadjusted federal debt by 26 percent. or $28.728 additional federal debt per person.

1100190345,"The point I want to make is this: We have to look ahead. If President Bush was right when he said America is addicted to oil. how can we break the addiction? We will never be oil free. That is ludicrous. We will have a dependence on fossil fuels. on oil. for my lifetime and well beyond. But if we want to be fair to the next generation. we have to be pushing for an energy agenda which sees a source of energy homegrown in America. so we are independent and do not have to rely on OPEC and foreign countries. a source of energy that is kind to the environment. so we do not make global warming worse for kids in the future. and a source of energy that is affordable. In order to reach that goaland America can reach ityou cannot look backward. as the Republicans have by saying: Lets keep doing what we have always done. Lets keep drilling for oil. You need responsible exploration and production of oil. and you need another future agenda: a nextyear agenda that says we are going to look to a way to produce energy to keep this economy moving that is affordable. We have the bill to do it. It is a bill that has lost on the floor of the Senate. It is the energy tax production credit. It is one that will produce energy. We cannot get enough Republican votes to support it. We are going to try again. We are going to keep trying because with this bill we are going to expand tax credits for biomass and hydropower. for solar energy. for biodiesel production. We are going to have tax credits for local governments in renewable projects. advanced coal electricity demonstration projects. plugin electric cars. heavy vehicle excise tax for truck idling reduction. It goes on and ona list of ways to conserve energy and look to future uses of energy that are consistent with an American economy that will grow and not be too expensive for the American people. That is what we have to move to. This afternoon we will give our Republican colleagues a chance to take their signs -that say ""produce more"" and turn them into a vote for this tax program. that will produce more.

1110035132,Mr. President. I rise today with my good friend from Vermont.. Senator SANDERS. to introduce legislation that will help our environment and our economy by providing a 25 percent tax credit towards the purchase of environmentally friendly lawn. garden. and forestry power equipment. There are an estimated 50 million acres of lawns and managed turf grass in the U.S. and the small engines used in power equipment predominantly used today to maintain these lawns emit a variety of pollutants that can be harmful to people and the environment. By promoting the use of alternative fuels. we can reduce the carbon fotprint of lawn and garden equipment and reduce air and water pollution. The Environmental Protection Agency. EPA. recently finalized a new emission control program to reduce hydrocarbon emissions and evaporative emissions from the small. sparkignition engines that are commonly used in lawn. garden. and forestry equipment. I applaud the EPA for setting these new emissions standards because they eventually will reduce the harmful health effects of ozone and carbon monoxide. I also appreciate the work being done in the State of California to set the stage for these tougher standards and to provide State funds for rebates to consumers who purchase the cleanest types of lawn and garden equipment. We can do more. though. to advance the use of cleaner. alternative fueled equipment. Currently. the cleanest. alternative powered equipment typically costs dramatically more to producein part due to their relatively low volumes--compared to higher volume products powered by traditional technologies. Our bill is designed to help partially close this price differential so that consumers can afford the very cleanest products and help advance the most cuttingedge. new technologies. That is why the bill we are introducing today would reduce air pollution even further than the EPA or California standards by providing an immediate incentive for people to go beyond the current powered equipment emission standards and purchase cleaner. alternatively powered or alternative fuel engines and equipment that emit half of the emission levels called for by the EPA and that operate on little or no fossil fuels. In line with past tax credits that were successful in advancing new technologies and boosting consumer demand for environmentally friendly products like hybrid vehicles and energy efficient home appliances. our new tax credit would give Americans a powerful incentive to buy clean. alternative energy power equipment. I want to thank the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute and the National Audubon Society for their early endorsements of this bill. As the Senate prepares to take a thorough look at our energy and environmental policies this year. I look forward to working with my colleagues to find new ways to further reduce the air emissions and fossil fuel consumption of our Nations lawn. garden. and forestry equipment. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.,111120181.0,LEAHY,PATRICK,S,VT,M,D,,voting,S,2009-04-29,207,Mr. LEAHY,Unknown,LEAHY,Unknown,M,16361,16447,04292009.txt,3036,478,111,2009,rise good introduc help environ economi provid percent credit toward purchas environment friendli lawn garden forestri equip estim million acr lawn turf grass us small engin equip predominantli maintain lawn emit varieti pollut harm peopl environ promot fuel carbon fotprint lawn garden equip air water pollut environment epa final new emiss control program hydrocarbon emiss evapor emiss small sparkignit engin commonli lawn garden forestri equip applaud epa new emiss standard eventu harm health effect ozon carbon monoxid also work done california tougher standard provid fund rebat consum purchas cleanest lawn garden equip though advanc cleaner fuel equip current cleanest equip typic dramat producein part rel low volumescompar higher product tradit technolog help partial close price differenti consum afford cleanest product help advanc cuttingedg new technolog introduc air pollut even epa california standard provid incent peopl beyond current equip emiss standard purchas cleaner fuel engin equip emit half emiss level call epa fossil fuel credit success advanc new technolog boost consum environment friendli product like hybrid vehicl energi effici home applianc new credit give incent buy clean energi equip want outdoor equip institut nation audubon earli endors prepar take thorough look energi environment polici look work find new way air emiss fossil fuel consumpt nation lawn garden forestri equip consent print,290,0.2710843373493976,0.21487603305785125

Pretty dirty. pretty sooty emissions. and that goes back to the advance of the industrial age. Then they developed crushing and pulverizing the coal and sweeping it up in oxygen to burn it a. little more thoroughly. It still has. if youre a climate change person and carbon person. that still you have the carbon emissions. Now. the carbon emissions are not toxic. Its not like nitrous oxide. its not like SO2. Its not like particulate matter. Its not an issue where people are going to point the finger and say. Oh. youre causing a disease by these emissions. Carbon. its naturally occurring. but there are some people who have problems with that. So the best way to address that is to go back to technology that was developed in World War II. Its FischerTropsch. Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch. Its almost like kind of a joke. Its Hans and Franz. Fischer and Tropsch. who developed the technology to take coal. synthetically. and gasify it or turn it into liquid fuel. And when you gasify it and you burn it. you burn it cleanly.

By establishing a road mapping process for solar research. development. and demonstration. the bill provides essential aid for the solar industry. I offer my enthusiastic support. Solar technology presents one of our most promising renewable energy sources. In fact. in my own district. the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF). is conducting innovative research pertaining to solar energy and putting it to use. Several of the buildings on campus have solar panels that provide electricity for the school. The 40kilowatt photovoltaic array on the roof of Walters Hall. made possible by state incentives. has the ability to generate electricity even on overcast days. Thin film PV technology and molecular PV technology are of particular importance as they are the future of photovoltaic technology. By using this second generation of solar technology. we will be able to significantly lower costs while increasing conversion efficiencies. I also specifically encourage demonstration projects in the 1 to 2 megawatt range. Increasing the energy productivity on these technologies. I believe. will have the greatest impact on the solar industry.

1100169983,Madam Chairman. I yield myself 30 seconds to say that it is interesting. that again they talk about the increased energy costs for schools. And at the same time that we are considering legislation which is designed to lower those energy costs for schools. they are arguing against the passage of this legislation. This is a modest effort by the Federal Government to help these schools get on with the refurbishing. the repair. and the renovation of these schools so that they will lower their energy costs. whether it is heating or air conditioning. so that they can then put that money back into the educational program.

1110060063,Madam Speaker. I am encouraged by the latest movement towards normalization of relations between the Republic of Turkey and the Republic of Armenia. On August 31. 2009. the Foreign Ministers of Turkey. Armenia and Switzerland sent out a joint press release which was the latest significant step down the path to establishing diplomatic relations between Turkey and Armenia. The countries have completed and initialed two protocols which will. when they enter into force. provide a framework for the normalization of the bilateral relations. Moreover. I am encouraged that the parties have also included a timetable for implementation of the agreement which is an added confidence building measure for both sides. The citizens of Turkey and Armenia can now see a positive light at the end of the tunnel and we should do what we can to help them achieve their common goals. This is a significant step in the right direction for the region and the world at large. The United States should continue to encourage and support the efforts of Turkey and Armenia. with the good offices of Switzerland. to build a productive and stable bilateral relationship and thereby enhance stability throughout the region.,,,,,,,,,,E,2009-09-16,1100,Ms. FOXX,Unknown,FOXX,Unknown,F,62893,62925,09162009.txt,1201,195,111,2009,encourag latest movement toward normal relat republ turkey republ armenia august foreign minist turkey armenia switzerland releas latest signific path establish relat turkey armenia complet two protocol enter forc provid framework normal bilater relat moreov encourag parti also includ timet implement confid build measur side citizen turkey armenia see posit light tunnel help achiev common goal signific direct region world larg continu encourag effort turkey armenia good switzerland build product stabl bilater relationship enhanc stabil region,96,0.25333333333333335,0.21428571428571427

1110005900,"Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the socalled stimulus bill for a number of reasons. both process and procedural. On the process. we had 1 day to consider 270 pages of text in the Energy and Commerce Committee. Five Republican amendments were accepted during the markup. three of those five were stricken from the bill before it came to the floor. and the fourth one. which is in the bill. is in the bill in a different form than which it was agreed upon during the negotiations during the markup. I dont think that is really good form. On the substance of the bill. most of the Energy and Commerce title is ieally social program policy and spending. It may be good. but it is not stimulative in and of itself in terms of what we are here to do. There is one title in the energy section which I think my friends on the majority side need to know about. it is something called decoupling. It gives a utility the right to petition a State that if the consumers in that State do all these energy efficient measures and they decrease their use of electricity. by decoupling what the consumers pay for it the utility has a revenue guarantee: Use less. pay more. I mean. as insane as that sounds. it is in this bill. I offered an amendment to strike that from the bill in the committee and it was on a party line vote rejected. Every Democrat voted to keep that in the bill. every Republican voted to remove it. So if this actually becomes law. if a governor of a State acts positively on a petition from a utility in that State. the utility can decouple what it charges your voters for what you pay for electricity regardless of how much you use. If somebody cuts their electricity use 20 percent. they pay the same. Now. I dont know about most voters. but I know my voters. if they conserve and consume less electricity. they want to pay less. but under this bill. they are going to pay more. How is that stimulative to the economy? I think that is actually destructive of the economy. So. Mr. Chairman. with all due respect. while there is some good in this bill. there is so much that is really not stimulative. and there is some stuff that is just really harmful that we should vote ""no.""

1110069421,Mr. President. today. I. along with my colleague Senator SNOWE. are introducing legislation to establish a comprehensive ocean. coastal. Great Lakes. and atmospheric research program to support renewable energy. Renewable energy is the most rapidly growing U.S. energy sector. Increasing the use of renewable energy is dependent on baseline atmospheric and oceanic data. Improving NOAAs ability to provide the observations. forecasts. and climate information tailored to the needs of the renewable energy industry will promote growth of this energy sector. This bill would require NOAA to establish a comprehensive research. prediction. and environmental information program to support renewable energy. Specifically. the legislation would require NOAA to develop observation systems and models and collect baseline environmental data to support renewable energy development on land and in the marine environment. and provide best management practices to avoid adverse effects in the marine and coastal environment. The legislation would authorize $100 million annually for fiscal year 2010 through 2014 and allows for up to 50 percent of funds to be available to educational institutions or states to carry out activities in support of the program. As we work as a Nation to decrease our dependency on foreign oil. to encourage scientific advancement. technological innovation and job creation. the Renewable Energy Environmental Research Act of 2009 will be an important component in advancing progress in those areas. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to support critical research in support of advancing renewable energy development. Mr. President.

A general appropriation bill remains ""under consideration"" even after the Committee of the Whole has risen and reported the bill back to the House. As such. a motion to recommit a general appropriation bill remains subject to clause 2(c) of ruleXXI. Because it is not in order topropose as instructions in a motion to recommit amendatory language that would not be in order if offered as a direct amendment. a motion to recommit that proposes a limitation amendment is not in order unless such limitation amendment was actually offered and .considered in the Committee of the Whole.

1110025495,Absolutely. And Representative POLIS is right. We have reached over all of the sectors. from agriculture to service. to small business to larger business and manufacturing and then industry. all of these areas are benefited. as are our homes. because housing in this country is a big part of the looming issue out there of carbon footprint. of energy consumption. and certainly its a great opportunity for us to reduce deNrand. But lets also look at that transportation sector. In this effort to grow new opportunities. we are going to look at that transportation sector and provide for advanced battery manufacturing. taking. again. R&D experiences that are working today. and put them to use. not only in the transportation area. but in energy generation and energy storage. Some of our intermittent power. whether it be solar or wind. needs to be bolstered by the fact that we can store that power so that when we are at peak situations. it is then most useful. and we can create that battery storage issue. I am convinced. We heard again about various efforts to improve battery operations out there. And the fact that $2 billion. as part of the Recovery Act and certainly. additional involvement in the Federal budget will allow us to. then. move forward with the batteries of the future. be they Lithium batteries. Lithium ion battery or others that are being developed that will now allow us to really transform the transportation sector. You know. when gas prices were hitting the $4 and beyond mark. everyone was exploding with the need for us to do something about it. Well. this takes a plan. and its not going to happen overnight. We were warned in the 70s to begin to do your greening up of energy policy. That didnt happen. So we need to move forward and make certain that this innovation comes in the boldness that it requires and deserves and certainly that the American public deserves. So Representative POLIS.

Dan Beard. the chief operating officer of the House. has been and viewed these systems as has the chairwoman of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. been in consultation with us about the notion that in just a couple of years. we could take an entire House office building in Washington. D.C. and take it off of the fossilfired powerhouse here on Capitol Hill. take it off of that coal powerhouse and put it on a solid oxide stationary fuel cell to demonstrate to the country that emissionless. completely emissionless. not nuclear. but through a new technology called a stationary solid oxide fuel cell. you could completely power and cool and heat and cool the water in a huge House office building or a 100.000 square foot commercial center with this new technology. Tremendous. You would think every utility in the country would be interested in that because there is no transmission grid. It makes us more terroristproof because you cant shut down the transmission grid because everybodys got their own electricity source. And if transportation is moving towards electricity. it has tremendous potential. I would just say that your energy efficiency. renewable energy. conservation programs should be at the forefront followed by a real understanding that we have. capacity needs in this country. I. too. was in China in January. I have a great concern because what I heard and saw in China about their attitudes towards the environment is that this is indeed their industrial revolution and theyre entitled to it. The problem with them having an industrial revolution in 2008 is theyre almost onefourth of the worlds population. and if they have an industrial revolution without environmental responsibility at the same time the rest of the world is being called on to reduce carbon and their carbon footprint. its a regulatory burden to the industrialized world and it lets these developing nations. including China. off without those regulations.

1110009731,"Madam Speaker. today I am introducing the ""American Renewable Energy Act"" to create a national renewable electricity standard that will revitalize our economy by creating hundreds of thousands of green jobs. save consumers billions of dollars on their energy bills and reduce our Nations global warming pollution by dramatically increasing our use of clean. renewable power. In the 110th Congress. the House repeatedly passed a national renewable electricity standard in overwhelming. bipartisan votes requiring that 15 percent of our electricity come from renewable energy sources like wind. solar and biomass and efficiency gains by 2020. The American Renewable Energy Act that I am introducing today would build upon that legislation and follows President Obamas goal that we generate 25 percent of our electricity from renewables by the year 2025. Electric power generation is responsible for roughly 40 percent of U.S. carbon dioxide emissionsthe most prevalent of the heattrapping gases causing global warming. Right now. the combustion of fossil fuels like coal. oil. and natural gas currently produce more than 70 percent of U.S. electricity. However. the way that we generate electricity is already beginning to change dramatically. In 2007. we installed 5.244 megawatts of new wind generation. which accounted for 35 percent of all new generation that came online. second only to natural gas. And in 2008. the United States installed more than 8.300 megawatts of new wind capacityover 40 percent of all new generation that was brought online. That newly installed capacity in 2008 led to the creation of more than 35.000 jobs in the wind industry over the last year. Much of that renewable generation is the result of states across the country that are putting policies in place to incentivize renewable generation. Already. 27 States and the District of Columbia have adopted renewable electricity standards at the State level. Adopting a national renewable electricity standard will further unleash our technological innovation and allow for the development of renewable resources all across the country. Every region of the country has renewable resources waiting to be tapped. For instance. the Southeast is home to nearly a third of the biomass feedstock potential in the entire country. Special power plants can burn biomass exclusively and existing coal plants can cofire biomass in their fuel stream without costly equipment upgrades. replacing 15 percent or more of fossil fuel needs with renewable fuel. Customersited solar photovoltaic cells would also earn triple credits under the legislation that I am introducing today. making the target much easier to achieve in places like Florida and Georgia where the solar photovoltaic resource is estimated to be 8385 percent of the best solar resources in the world. Adopting a national renewable electricity standard can reinvigorate our economy and our manufacturing sectors by creating an entire new cadre of greencollar jobs. Each wind turbine requires 220 to neary 400 tons of steal to produce and workers to produce it. From the revamped Maytag plant that is now producing wind turbines in Iowa to the former Ohio manufacturing plant that President Obama visited on his way to Washington. alternative energy can revitalize our declining manufacturing centers all across our country. Adopting a 25 percent renewable electricity standard will create more than 350.000 green jobs by 2020allowing the people who most need work to do the work that most needs to be done in order to address the climate crisis. Moreover. adopting a renewable electricity standard will save consumers money by reducing their energy bills. Adopting a national standard of 25 percent will save consumers more than $49 billion over the next decade in lower energy bills. while channeling more than $70 billion in new investment into renewable technologies. The American people overwhelming support a national renewable electricity standard. According to a December poll conducted by the E197 Washington Post and ABC News. 84 percent of Americans support requiring utilities to increase their use of wind. solar andother renewable sources of power. President Obama understands the importance of increasing our use of renewable energy to unleash a clean energy revolution that will get our economy moving again. The States all across the country that have already put similar policies in place understand the need for action. The overwhelming majority of the American people understand it. Now it is time for the Congress to take action to unleash the clean energy revolution by adopting a national renewable electricity standard.",,,,,,,,,,E,2009-02-04,1066,Mr. MARKEY,Unknown,MARKEY,Unknown,M,69880,70000,02042009.txt,4673,728,111,2009,introduc renew energi nation renew electr standard revit economi thousand green job consum billion energi nation global warm pollut dramat increas clean renew repeatedli nation renew electr standard overwhelm bipartisan percent electr come renew energi sourc like wind solar biomass effici gain renew energi introduc build obama goal gener percent electr renew electr gener respons roughli percent us carbon dioxid emissionsth preval heattrap gase caus global warm combust fossil fuel like coal natur current produc percent us electr way gener electr alreadi dramat instal megawatt new wind gener percent new gener came onlin natur instal megawatt new wind capacityov percent new gener brought onlin newli instal capac led job wind industri last renew gener result polici place incentiv renew gener alreadi renew electr standard level nation renew electr standard unleash technolog allow develop renew region renew wait tap instanc southeast home nearli biomass feedstock potenti entir plant burn biomass exclus exist coal plant cofir biomass fuel stream without costli equip upgrad percent fossil fuel need renew fuel customersit solar photovolta cell also earn tripl credit introduc make target easier achiev place like florida solar photovolta estim percent best solar world nation renew electr standard reinvigor economi manufactur sector entir new cadr greencollar job wind turbin neari ton steal produc worker produc revamp maytag plant produc wind turbin manufactur plant obama visit way energi revit manufactur center percent renew electr standard green job allow peopl need work work need done climat crisi moreov renew electr standard consum money energi nation standard percent consum billion next decad lower energi channel billion new invest renew technolog peopl overwhelm nation renew electr standard decemb poll post abc news percent increas wind solar andoth renew sourc obama understand import increas renew energi unleash clean energi revolut get economi move alreadi similar polici place understand need overwhelm peopl understand take unleash clean energi revolut nation renew electr standard,433,0.3055555555555556,0.21333333333333335
1110025674,Thank you. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman. the President has proposed that the Federal Government impose a capandtrade system aimed at limiting and reducing carbon emissions in our country. This capandtrade system is really a national energy tax that could cost $2 trillion. As a result of that. American families could pay up to $3.100 per year in higher energy and fuel costs. Lets set aside the fact that our economy cant afford such a massive new tax on such basic essential services as electricity. Lets also set aside the fact that wed be handicapping the American worker and small business by imposing such a tax when China and India are unapologetically racing to expand carbon emissions in their country. The Presidents capandtrade scheme aims to curb manmade carbon emissions. but the bill before us today is about wildfiresand the fact is that we know very little about the massive carbon emissions created by such fires. Yet. what little information we do have on wildfires is absolutely astonishing. For example. the 2003 Hayman fire in Colorado produced more CO2 than was produced by the entire population of the State of Colorado in a single year. My amendment simply directs the Forest Service to gather information on the emissions of wildfires because such knowledge is an essential component in making national policy decisions on greenhouse gases that are based on facts and proven science and not conjecture and unproven consensus. We cant afford to impose a $2 trillion energy tax on our economy and on American families and small businesses. especially when we werent even aware of the massive carbon outputs of wildfires that the Federal Government is doing enough to prevent right now. So I urge support of my amendment.,111117640.0,HASTINGS,DOC,H,WA,M,R,4.0,voting,H,2009-03-26,48,Mr. HASTINGS of Washington,Unknown,HASTINGS,Washington,M,1519,1573,03262009.txt,1741,289,111,2009,propos impos capandtrad aim limit carbon emiss capandtrad realli nation energi could trillion result famili could pay per higher energi fuel fact economi cant afford massiv new basic electr also fact wed handicap worker small impos china india unapologet race expand carbon emiss capandtrad scheme aim curb manmad carbon emiss us wildfiresand fact know massiv carbon emiss fire inform wildfir absolut astonish exampl hayman fire produc co produc entir popul simpli direct forest gather inform emiss wildfir knowledg compon make nation polici decis greenhous gase fact proven scienc conjectur unproven consensu cant afford impos trillion energi economi famili small especi werent even awar massiv carbon output wildfir enough,164,0.3055555555555556,0.21333333333333335
1100163196,I want to congratulate the chairman and the ranking member of the full committee for this conference report. Mr. Speaker. in addition to the important reforms and preserving the safety net and the commodity title as well as important increases in the nutrition and conservation titles. I worked with the chairman of the full committee during the House version of the markup to place an emphasis on beginning farmers and ranchers. This conference report includes a number of important provisions. including reauthorizing taxexempt bonds to provide lowinterest loans to beginning farmers and ranchers. increasing the loan limit for them from $250.000 to $450.000 and indexing that limit amount for inflation. There are also important provisions in the credit and research titles of this conference report for beginning farmers and ranchers. The energy title is another area that as Mr. HOLDEN. the chairman of the Subcommittee on Conservation. Credit. Energy and Research. pointed out. the loan guarantees for advance biofuel production plants. reauthorizing the Rural Energy for America Program which provides the loans. loan guarantees and grants for producers to purchase and install onthefarm renewable energy systems. establishing a forest bioenergy program. and. of course. championed by the chairman of the full committee. the biomass crop assistance program.

1100191906,Mr. Speaker. I thank the chairman of our subcommittee for yielding to me. This bill that we are considering now. the Animal Drug User Fee Act. or ADUFA. will enhance and improve FDAs ability to promptly review new medicines for animals. and that is very important that we all support this. This reauthorization has also given us an opportunity to look at providing FDA with new tools to address a related public health crisis. the problem of antibiotic resistance caused by the industrial farming practice of using human antibiotics for nontherapeutic uses in food producing animals. We now have an overwhelming body of evidence showing that the overuse of antibiotics in industrial farm production is threatening to destroy the effectiveness of some of our most important antibiotics for human use. Many of the worlds most prestigious experts. the Institute of Medicine. the Pew Commission. World Health Organization and Government Accountability Office have warned about the dangers to global public health of such widespread overuse. These drugs are breeding resistant microorganisms that can and do get transferred to humans. They also leach into the environment and show up in our drinking water. The experts have told us that the more antibiotics we consume. the more resistance develops.,110117860.0,WAXMAN,HENRY,H,CA,M,D,30.0,voting,H,2008-07-30,667,Mr. WAXMAN,Unknown,WAXMAN,Unknown,M,82726,82762,07302008.txt,1294,206,110,2008,subcommitte consid anim drug user fee adufa enhanc improv fda promptli new medicin anim import reauthor also given us look provid fda new tool relat health crisi problem antibiot resist caus industri farm human antibiot nontherapeut food produc anim overwhelm evid show overus antibiot industri farm product threaten destroy effect import antibiot human world prestigi expert institut medicin pew world health warn danger global health widespread overus drug breed resist microorgan get human also leach environ show drink water expert told us antibiot consum resist develop,112,0.27380952380952384,0.21311475409836064

1100197864,Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of the energy legislation before the House. We need a comprehensive approach that includes responsible development of additional energy resources. greater energy efficiency. tax incentives to spur alternative energy. investment in new technologies. and relief to American consumers. The bill before the House does that. It is clear that a moreofthesame approach to energy will not work. If weve learned nothing else from the last eight years. weve learned that we cannot drill our way to energy security. Neither will conservation alone do the job. The legislation before us provides longterm incentives for renewable energy that will give the solar. wind. and biomass industries the stability they need to make investments in additional production capacity. There are also significant incentives for making our nation and economy more energy efficient. The offshore drilling provisions of this legislation open up as much as 400 million acres of land off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts that are currently off limits to drilling. Through this compromise. we will expand oil production offshore. while setting a reasonable buffer zone. The legislation requires electric utilities to produce more of their electricity from renewable energy sources. This is smart energy policy that will create new industries and new American jobs. The legislation increases the tax credit for alternative refueling property. such as E85 pumps. and extends the credit through 2010. Biofuels are an important component of our nations energy strategy. and U.S. automakers have made significant investments to bring flexfuel vehicles to market. To maximize the impact of this progress we need to speed the deployment of E85 pumps. This legislation also provides incentives for manufacturers to produce washing machines. refrigerators and dishwashers that push the boundaries of energy and water efficiency. and to build them in the United States. Reducing the energy and water usage of a washing machine over time and across millions of households will produce remarkable reductions in energy and water usage. saving consumers billions on their utility bills. In a word. the approach taken by this biH is comprehensive. It addresses both the supply and demand sides of. our nations energy policy. It is a balanced. responsible and longterm approach to addressing the challenges of energy security. I urge all of my colleagues to support this comprehensive package.,110120210.0,LEVIN,SANDER,H,MI,M,D,12.0,voting,H,2008-09-16,729,Mr. LEVIN,Unknown,LEVIN,Unknown,M,54005,54065,09162008.txt,2481,383,110,2008,rise strong energi need comprehens approach includ respons develop energi greater energi effici incent spur energi invest new technolog relief consum clear moreofthesam approach energi work weve learn els last eight weve learn drill way energi neither conserv alon job us provid longterm incent renew energi give solar wind biomass industri stabil need make invest product capac also signific incent make nation economi energi effici offshor drill provis open million acr land atlant pacif coast current limit drill compromis expand product offshor buffer zone electr produc electr renew energi sourc smart energi polici new industri new job increas credit refuel pump extend credit biofuel import compon nation energi strategi us automak signific invest bring flexfuel vehicl market maxim impact progress need speed deploy pump also provid incent manufactur produc wash machin refriger dishwash push boundari energi water effici build energi water usag wash machin million household produc energi water usag consum billion word approach taken bih comprehens suppli side nation energi polici balanc respons longterm approach challeng energi comprehens packag,222,0.25,0.21296296296296297
1110055707,Madam Speaker. I rise today in support of this rule. which includes an amendment I worked to draft with my colleagues. Ms. TITUS of Nevada and Ms. GIFFORDS of Arizona. This amendment will make sure that the Federal Government leads by example on clean energy. In my district. Kirtland Air Force Base has tried for a number of years to contract with local cleanenergy producers to purchase electricity to help power the base. but there are several Federal policies that stand in the way of these kinds of projects. New Mexico is second in theNation for solar energy potential. and we have a thriving cleanenergy industry in Albuquerque. creating jobs today. So this is a natural partnership. However. many Federal agencies have discovered that the 10year limit on Federal power purchase agreements made these kinds of agreements uneconomical for their private sector partners in the solar industry. Our amendment will extend the length. of these contracts to 20 years. allowing.more Federal.agencies to.sign agreements. with cleanenergy producers. This will put Americans to work and ensure the Federal Government leads by example in the use of. clean energy.

A new motor would conserve a great deal. a new. more efficient motor would conserve a great deal of energy. And I think that if you doubled the efficiency of engines on the highway today. or if you had an engine that doubled the efficiency. the threat of that doubling.of efficiency would almost immediately result in a plummeting of the price of oil overnight. without any additional production.

1110003138,Madam President. S. 22. the Omnibus Public Land Management Act. includes five bills vital for increasing our Nations understanding of our oceans. Great Lakes. and coastal areas. The ocean bills included in this package are all strong bipartisan pieces of legislation that were favorably reported by the Senate Commerce Committee in the 110th Congress and passed the House of Representatives. The oceans cover twothirds of our planet. yet we know little about what lies beneath them or how the changing climate is affecting marine resources. Millions of Americans depend directly and indirectly on healthy and bountiful oceans. In 2007. our Nations coastal economies contributed nearly 50 percent. or $6.7 trillion. to the national gross domestic product. While our Nation relies on our ocean. Great Lakes. and coastal resources. tremendous gaps exist in our knowledge of these ecosystems. The Senate Commerce Committee provisions included in S. 22 will strengthen and improve our marine. coastal. and. scientific programs. and will help us make the best possible decisions about how to manage. conserve. and protectthese valuable resources. The Ocean Exploration and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA. Undersea Research Program Act. included in this package. will give us a better understanding of our marine ecosystems and resources. This legislation reflects a long history of bipartisan collaboration in the Senate. It passed the Senate by unanimous consent in the both the 108th and 109th Congresses and was reported favorably in the 110th Congress by the Commerce Committee. The provision establishes an interdisciplinary ocean exploration program to gather observations and data from areas in the ocean we have previously been unable to explore. In addition. this legislation would help strengthen and coordinate NOAAs National Undersea Research Program. The National Undersea Research Program seeks to increase scientific knowledge for the management. use. and preservation of ocean. Great Lakes. and coastal resources through undersea research. exploration. education. and technology development. These essential activities are imperative given that approximately 95 percent of the ocean floor remains unexplored. Ocean exploration and undersea research provides unprecedented opportunities to discover items of natural. cultural. and economic value including new sources of minerals. drugs. habitats. species. artifacts. and shipwrecks. The Ocean and Coastal Mapping Integration Act included in S. 22 would integrate Federal and coastal mapping activities throughout the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. Approximately 90 percent of our Nations maritime territory remains unmapped by modern technology. Improved mapping of our Nations coastal and ocean waters will increase our understanding of the marine environment. thereby increasing the safety of navigation in our maritime domain. supporting national security missions of the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard. and allowing for better management of marine ecosystems and resources. This bill also has a longstanding history of broad bipartisan support in both the Senate and House. The Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation System Act would build on current regional systems to establish a national integrated ocean. Great Lakes. and coastal observing system to collect. compile. and make available data to support marine commerce. weather. climate. and marine forecasting. energy siting and production. navigation. ecosystembased resource management. and public safety. The legislation passed the Senate by unanimous consent in both the 108th and 109th Congresses. During the 110th Congress. the legislation passed the House and was reported favorably by the Senate Commerce Committee. The Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act in S. 22 mandates that steps be taken to understand and address climate change and its impacts on our oceans. a much needed and important action. Over the past 200 years. human activities have resulted in dramatic increases in greenhouse gases that are altering the Earths climate. The oceans mitigate the effects of global warming by absorbing approximately half of all this atmospheric carbon dioxide. However. as the oceans absorb more carbon dioxide. their chemistry is changing and the oceans are becoming more acidic. The Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act would establish an interagency committee to develop a strategic research plan on ocean acidification and establish an ocean acidification program within NOAA to conduct research and longterm monitoring on our acidifying oceans and to develop adaptation strategies and techniques for conserving marine ecosystems. This legislation represents a bipartisan effort to promote climate change research and adaptation activities. The bill was reported favorably by the Senate Commerce Committee and passed the House in the 110th Congress. The final oceans bill included in S. 22 is the Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program Act. As the U.S. population grows and more people move to the coasts. our coastal lands and ecosystems are threatened by unsustainable development. This legislation authorizes NOAA to award competitive grants to coastal States. including the Great Lakes. to protect coastal and estuarine areas which have significant conservation. recreation. ecological. historic. or watershed protection value and are threatened by conversion to other uses. As chairman of the Commerce Committee during the. 110th Congress. I was pleased to favorably report these important ocean .policy bills.

1100155835,Madam Speaker. Texas is now the number one wind energy state in the country. producing more power from wind than any other state. Texas is also the first state to allow wind energy production offshore. energy. which could not only power our homes and businesses. but also pay for the education of our children. The Gulf Coast currently has unused oil equipment in its waters. Those structures now have a new purpose. as wind turbines utilize oil and gas platforms off the TexasLouisiana coast in the first U.S. offshore wind energy farm. The shallow waters of the Gulf make economic sense for wind farms. Wind farms consist of turbines that harness clean energy and offer another option outside of natural gas. The coastline has a farreaching continental shelf. in some areas extending 80 miles. while having water depths less than 150 feet. Texas. long a major player in the oil and gas industry. is now a major player in wind energy. In this region. the best wind for generating energy blows midday. when electricity demand is the highest. Therefore. the electricity generated from wind farms off the Texas coast will be highly valued by utility companies. (Remarks E701 Wind Energy Systems Technology (WEST). conceived by Herman Schellstede and Harold Schoefiler. will be lining nearly 74.000 acres of water with wind farms. which includes part of my district. -in the waters off of Jefferson County. on state owned land. Construction of the wind farms should begin in 2009. Once completed. the offshore wind farm will produce enough electricity to provide power to about 40.000 homes. By comparison. an equal amount of electricity would require about 20.7 million barrels of oil. or 6.5 tons of cQal to produce. By not buming these fossil fuels to create this amount of energy. the wind farm will displace approximately 2.7 million tons of carbon dioxide each year. It is in our best interest to research and develop altemative energy sources to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. in order to become more energy independent. With natural gas depleting. wind farms should become more abundant in the coming years. as wind power becomes more competitive and the technology more efficient.. Wind is a clean energy resource with substantial environmental benefits and offers one of the lowest marginal costs of production. This renewable energy means renewable revenue. Some have reported that wind energy provides more jobs per dollar invested or per kilowatthour generated. than most conventional resource options. With total installed U.S. wind power capacity now over 16.800 megawatts or enough to serve the equivalent of 4.5 million average households. wind was the second largest source of new electfical capacity in the Nation. behind only natural gas. for the past 3 years. Wind power is part of our countrys sustainable energy solution. and I applaud WEST for their foresight and innovation.,,,,,,,,,,E,2008-04-23,966,Mr. POE,Unknown,POE,Unknown,M,48050,48119,04232008.txt,2903,474,110,2008,wind energi produc wind also first allow wind energi product offshor energi could home also pay children gulf coast current unus equip water structur new purpos wind turbin platform texaslouisiana coast first us offshor wind energi farm shallow water gulf make econom sens wind farm wind farm consist turbin har clean energi anoth natur coastlin farreach continent shelf area extend mile water depth feet long player industri player wind energi region best wind gener energi blow midday electr highest electr gener wind farm coast highli valu compani wind energi technolog conceiv herman schellsted harold schoefil nearli acr water wind farm includ part water counti own land construct wind farm complet offshor wind farm produc enough electr provid home comparison equal amount electr million barrel ton cqal produc bume fossil fuel amount energi wind farm displac approxim million ton carbon dioxid best interest research develop altem energi sourc depend foreign becom energi independ natur deplet wind farm becom come wind becom competit technolog effici wind clean energi environment benefit lowest margin product renew energi mean renew report wind energi provid job per invest per kilowatthour gener convent total instal us wind capac megawatt enough equival million averag household wind largest sourc new electf capac nation behind natur wind part energi solut applaud foresight,286,0.2616279069767442,0.2125984251968504

This adaptive management system employs sciencebased applied evaluation tools to give each farmer baseline data. in the first year. then performance data in subsequent years giving them real feedback from their own operation on which to make management decisions regarding nutrients. soil. pests. energy uses and sources. wildlife habitat. greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) and other atmospheric resources he or she may prioritize. ISA staff train and oversee contracted Certified Crop Advisors who provide technical assistance to producers in developing and maintaining their CEMSA plan. Cost and profit data is also plugged into the plan to guide the producer in determining the economic sustainability of environmental performance. The public now demands from crop producers both increased production of food. fiber. fuel. and other biobased product feedstocks and increased. documented environmental performance to conserve soils. sequester carbon. improve water quality. reduce greenhouse gas emissions. improve energy efficiency and increase wildlife habitat.

He has anticipated the reason I came to the floor: to discuss what happened this week in the Senate or. to be more accurate. what didnt happen this week in the Senate.

The Republicans refused to join us to bring to the floor to debate the bill that would create tax incentives for investments in energy efficiency. renewable. sustainable energy that will not lead to global warming and will not lead to pollution. The frustration that I and other Members on the Democratic side feel comes from the fact that we have tried repeatedly to bring these measures to the floor and we have been stopped time and time again.

It is a provision that deals with the standards and protocols that will be used in Smart Grid demonstration projects. With respect to these demonstration projects. the conference report states that the Secretary of Energy ""shall require as a condition of receiving funding under this subsection that demonstration projects utilize open protocols and standards (including Internetbased protocols and standards) if available and appropriate."" This is a clarification of language originally passed by the House of Representatives on the subject. It makes clear that all protocols and standards used by Smart Grid demonstration projects must be open. Some of those open protocols and standards may involve sending information over the Internet. Others may use other means of data transfer. The parenthetical inclusion of Internetbased protocols and standards under the requirement for open standards means nothing more than that to the extent that an open standard uses the Internet. it is still an open standard. but (1) the universe of open standards and protocols is not considered to be limited to only those which use the Internet. and (2) the mere use of the Internet would not cause a standard to meet the criterion of being open if it were not otherwise an open standard. There is no intent in this language to discriminate for or against any given open protocol or standard. or to promote any one technology solution over another. so long as they are available and considered to be appropriate by the Secretary of Energy.

1100154014,Madam Speaker. I want to congratulate PACCAR. Inc. for eaming the 2008 Governors Trader of the*Year Award in Washington State for expanding the States international trade. PACCAR. headquartered in my congressional district. is a global leader in the design. manufacture and customer support of light-. medium- and heavyduty trucks. In addition. PACCAR provides financial services and informational technology for the actual truck makersall while conducting its business with the health and safety of the planet in mind. With 22.000 employees worldwide and 2.500 in Washington State. PACCAR is a local business with a truly global reach. In 2007. PACCAR had $15.2 billion in net income. selling products and services in more than 100 countries. while setting record industry sales for commercial vehicles above 15 tons in Western and Central Europe. I also want to recognize PACCAR for its leadership and innovation in energy independence and environmentally friendly business practices. The company truly represents the spirit of the Pacific Northwest region by conducting business within and very often exceeding regulatory environmental standards. harnessing the power and efficiency of solar energy and. perhaps most importantly. conserving energy utilizing breakthrough hybrid technology. PACCAR is a leader in truck design and manufacture. It is an American company from the Pacific Northwest with a global impact.

U.S. investors can buy as much oil as they want. helping to drive up demand with little to no oversight. It is essential the CFTC work with the FSA in London to limit positions and gather accurate information on the impact that speculation has on oil prices.

1100166414,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of passage of H.R. 6049. the Energy and Tax Extenders Act. Back home in Arizona. each and every day practically. we have free energy that radiates from the sky. An Arizona utility company recently proposed a plan to take advantage of that sunshine by building one of the worlds largest solar power plants. 280 megawatts. This project will inject millions of dollars into the State and regional economy. and once its complete. will produce enough electricity to power 77.000 homes. This exciting announcement comes with a caveat. If Congress fails to extend the 30 percent solar tax investment tax credit. this plant will not be constructed. The same stipulation has been given for a variety of solar projects across the Southwest. H.R. 6049 provides those vital extensions for renewable energy tax credits which include solar energy. and it will be the fourth time that the United States of House of Representatives has acted on this issue. I have repeatedly pushed for passage of these extensions because I know that theyre essential for the solar industry in our country. They will spur innovation. decrease our emission. and improve our energy independence. With technology improving. many solar industry leaders furthermore believe that solar energy is on track to be cost competitive with fossil fuels by 2015. if not sooner.

1100179679,Madam Speaker. the Democraticled Congress is working for consumers to lower gas prices and to launch a cleaner and more costeffective energy future that creates new green jobs and that reduces global warming. For 7 years. Washington Republicans allowed Big Oil to run our Nations energy policy. The result. high gas prices and continued dependence on oil. Democrats believe we must diversify our energy sources with bold investments in renewable energy and more efficient technology. Last year. for the first time in three decades. this Congress passed a landmark law that increases fuel efficiency to 35 miles per gallon and that will save American families at least $700 a year when it takes effect.

The bill provides $812 million for nuclear. $20 million above the fiscal year 2009 level. and $51 million above the Presidents request.

1100177765,If I may quickly conclude so my distinguished friend from Georgia. who has made some valid points about the Iraq war that we are still suffering. I was reading something. Congressman JOHNSON. about the condition of the Iraq oil wells and the difficulty of bringing them online and the need for U.S. investment or other investment. It is interesting. a lot of people think we are making a lot of money in Iraq. we are spending a lot of money in Iraq. I will tell you that. Let me say this. I will thank all three of my colleagues. I will continue to work and pursue an answer. The Representative indicated he was very interested. and would go back and ask. The meeting is in September and I will pursue that. I dont have the exact location. but I believe it is in Europe. If so. it would be easy for us to go. I think the other part would be to give the energy -leadership of these multinationals. and obviously they are in my congressional district. but a forum to be able to have a conversation outside of a hearing setting. We need to ask the hard questions. We need to ask how much of the cost of gasoline is the refinery cost? How much of the cost of jet fuel is refinery cost? What is attributable to having old refineries. and what can you do to make the energy name of your industry more diverse. to have more green and more alternatives such as wind and biomass. I am told that wind is very expensive. but you cant get that answer if we are not sitting down at the table. I thank the gentleman for the idea of a summit. We may work on that. Let me conclude by saying we have been working in this Congress. I dont want anyone to think that we have not been sensitive. You listed a whole road map that you. Mr. TOWNS. as a senior member of the Energy and Commerce Committee have been very much involved in. For example. the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of 2008. a combination of the Ways and Means Committee and the Energy Committee. which I think is very important because it encourages the development of innovative technologies. creating new jobs. reducing carbon emissions. protecting consumers. shifting production to cleaner renewable energy. and modernizing our energy infrastructure.

CCS is a method of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by capturing and injecting underground the carbon dioxide emitted from electricity generation plants that use fossil fuels. including petroleum. natural gas and coal. 72 percent of our nations electricity is generated through fossil fuel combustion. 51 percent is based on coal use. 20 percent is reliant on natural gas and 1.6 percent on petroleum. Given our extensive reliance on fossil fuels and the current unavailability of sufficient alternatives to them. the continued use of fossil fuels is essential to our economic security. The Carbon Capture and Storage Early Deployment Act addresses this clear need by enabling electric utilities that use coal to have the continued ability to do so when a mandatory program is implemented to control greenhouse gas emissions. I am preparing to draft a mandatory greenhouse gas control measure which will rely on cap and trade to address rising global temperatures and climate change. Power plants and industrial companies that bum fossil fuels will be required to lessen their emissions of CO2 in accordance with a schedule set in the statute. As CO2 constraints become ever more severe. not only coal using facilities will need to use CO2 capture and storage technologies. but facilities using natural gas and petroleum will as well. The use of CCS technology will enable fossil fuel users to meet the reduction requirements of the measure while continuing to use coal. oil or natural gas. The legislation I am introducing today represents a necessary first step toward the implementation of such a cap and trade system to address global climate change. If severe emissionsreduction requirements in a cap and trade system take effect before the carbon capture and storage technologies are available. the effect on coal fired utilities in particular would be severe. They would rapidly switch from coal to other fuels. Such fuel switching would significantly increase electricity prices to the severe detriment of both residential and industrial electricity consumers. Fuel switching from coal would most likely result in far greater uses of natural gas for electricity generation. severely stressing an already constrained natural gas supply and dramatically increasing natural gas prices. Today. 58 percent of U.S. homes are heated with natural gas. and numerous industries are heavily reliant on it. If large scale switching by utilities from coal to natural gas occurs. tens of millions of Americans would experience deep economic pain. and many domestic industries. from fertilizer to chemicals. would be dislocated. The early arrival of CCS is essential to prevent this economic disruption in a carbon constrained economy. Whilesome commercial CCS projects are in operation. they are small in scale and have the purpose of enhancing oil recovery. Further research. development and demonstration are necessary for the permanent storage underground of large quantities of CO2 in a variety of storage media in widely dispersed locationsaround the nation. In order to accelerate the deployment of CCS technologies. the Carbon Capture and Storage Early Deployment Act authorizes the establishment of a Carbon Storage Research Corporation. The nations fossil fuelbased electricity distribution utilities would be authorized to hold a referendum for the creation of the Corporation. If the referendum results in approval by representatives of twothirds- of the fossil fuelbased electricity delivered to retail consumers. the Corporation is established. The Corporation will be operated as a division or affiliate of the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and will be managed by a Board of not more than 12 members. which will be appointed by the EPRI and will include representatives of investor owned utilities. utilities owned by a federal or state agency or a municipality. rural electric cooperatives and fossil fuel producers. The Corporation will assess fees on distribution utilities for all fossil fuelbased electricity delivered to retail consumers. The assessment will be applied to electricity generated from coal. natural gas and oil and will reflect the relative CO2 emission rates of each fuel. The assessment will total approximately $1 billion annually. The legislation specifies that distribution utilities will be allowed to recover the costs of the fee from retail consumers. resulting in a roughly $10-$12 total annual increase in residential electricity rates. The $1 billion annual fund will be distributed by the Corporation in the form of grants and contracts to govemmental. academic and private entities for projects with the purpose of accelerating the commercial demonstration or availability of CCS technologies. I would like to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for working with me on and cosponsoring this legislation. The Carbon Capture and Storage Early Deployment Act enjoys bipartisan and industry support and will enable the continued use of our nations most inexpensive and abundant resources for fuel generation when a mandatory greenhouse gas emissions reduction program is implemented. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

1100195682,Mr. Speaker. back in 2003. congressional Republicans supported the BushCheney energy bill that was written in secret by Big Oil. And. boy. are we paying. Three years later. we have record prices for consumers and record profits for the oil companies. Since taking control of Congress last year. Democrats have worked hard to reverse these failed energy policies. For the first time in 32 years. we increased the fuel efficiency standards for vehicles so they will be more efficient. which will save Americans about $1.000 a year. We also made a historic commitment to investing in biofuels and increasing domestic oil supply and drill responsibly. This is a good start. but more needs to be done. Thats why House Democrats brought eight pieces of legislation up in July to cut the high cost of gas. and Republicans opposed every one of those bills. Mr. Speaker. its time for House Republicans to work with us Democrats to provide the American people lower costs at the pump and lower costs in the grocery store by ending the excessive Wall Street speculation in our energy markets and increasing our energy and food costs. Mr. Speaker. its time to end the manipulation of prices by Wall Street and the excessive speculation. to lower prices and save this American economy.,110116100.0,STUPAK,BART,H,MI,M,D,1.0,voting,H,2008-09-10,426,Mr. STUPAK,Unknown,STUPAK,Unknown,M,28142,28179,09102008.txt,1272,215,110,2008,back congression bushcheney energi written big boy pay three later price consum profit compani sinc take control last work hard revers fail energi polici first increas fuel effici standard vehicl effici also histor invest biofuel increas domest suppli drill respons good need done that brought eight piec cut high oppos work us provid peopl lower pump lower groceri store excess wall street specul energi market increas energi food manipul price wall street excess specul lower price economi,127,0.28735632183908044,0.20967741935483872
1110013100,Mr. President. I. rise today to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. NAACP. one of our Nations oldest and most influential civil rights organizations. . Founded on February 12. 1909. the NAACPs original and primary goal was to secure for African Americans the rights that our Constitution guarantees under the 13th. 14th and 15th amendments. The NAACP played a leading role in the civil rights movement in the mid20th century. stirring the conscience of our nation against segregation and institutionalized racism. Today. the NAACP continues its work to eliminate racial prejudice. and the organization has expanded its endeavors to ensure equal access to political. educational. social and economic advancement for all Americans. Throughout its 100year history. the NAACP has effected change at all levels of society and politics. working tirelessly through organizing. advocacy. and judicial action. From a small group of determined citizens in the early 1900s to an organization with over a halfmillion members and supporters .today. tle NAACP has established itself throughout America and the world as a leading champion for civil and human rights. I am proud to be a lifetime member of the NAACP. I share its desire to ensure economic fairness and social justice in this country. and I am pleased to congratulate the NAACP on the occasion of its 100th anniversary.,111116511.0,WEBB,JIM,S,VA,M,D,,voting,S,2009-02-12,162,Mr. WEBB,Unknown,WEBB,Unknown,M,10070,10110,02122009.txt,1447,228,111,2009,rise celebr anniversari found nation associ advanc color peopl naacp nation oldest influenti found naacp primari goal african guarante naacp play lead role movement midth centuri stir conscienc nation segreg institution racism naacp continu work racial prejudic expand endeavor ensur equal access polit social econom advanc histori naacp effect level polit work tirelessli advocaci small group determin citizen earli halfmillion naacp establish america world lead champion human proud lifetim naacp share ensur econom fair social pleas congratul naacp occas anniversari,125,0.3111111111111111,0.20967741935483872

1110069463,Mr. Speaker. scientists at the Climate Research Unit in eastern England have received more attention than their subject of study. global warming. Climategate. as it was dubbed. has been the focus of rampant speculation. As some accuse these scientists of manipulating figures to conclude that global warming was manmade. we forget that polar ice caps are melting. and that were hitting threshold points that cannot be reversed. Were forgetting that over 200 peerreviewed. scientific studies have determined that global warming is real. and that man significantly contributes to global warming. and that zero peerreviewed scientific studies have determined that global warming is not real. and that man does not contribute to that. Today. over 1.700 scientists from the UK announced their belief that global warming is real and that man contributes to this. Congress must send climate legislation to the President for approval.

1110025477,The good news is that President Obama is right on the beam of what you are suggesting. because in this capandtrade bill. he is not suggesting using the money that is generated by the polluting industries buying these permits for museums or nicknacks. He wants to put the money that doesnt go back to consumers. that is recyoled right back to consumers. which will be the bulk of it. he wants to put it in a research and development. and he is proposing $15 billionfrankly. we think it may end up being higher than thatto develop these American industrial technologies so we can put Americans to work in greencollar jobs. And I think that is so important. because if you look at the energy research we have been doing. it is pretty pathetic until President Obama was President. I will give you what was an eye opener to me. The dog food industry of the United States spends more on research and development than the entire electrical utility industry of the United States. We have not done our knitting when it comes to research and development funds. Now. we started in this new bill we just passed. which put about $70 billion into research. but we need the second. third. and fourth year out. And President Obama. in this capandtrade. we are going to dedicate these funds. They are not going to be used by Member of Congress for just some pet project. they are going to be dedicated for clean energy research and development. And when President Obama talks about that. what I am particularly impressed about is he is not focusing on one little silver bullet here like he has got some favorite technology. he is putting it in the whole vast array. of new possibilities. solar photovoltaic energy. concentrated solar energy. engineered geothermal energy. advanced biofuels. lithium ion batteries. coal sequestration to find out if we can burn coal in a way that doesnt put CO2 in the atmosphere.

1100191119,Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 6309. the LeadSafe Housing for Kids Act of 2008. designed to address the serious health hazards that high levels of lead have on children in their home environment. I4 1992 the Congress passed the landmark residential LeadBased Paint Hazard Reduction Act to address what was at the time an epidemic of childhood lead poisoning. In conjunction with Federal efforts to limit the use of leaded gasoline and lead in food and juice cans and in drinking water pipes. this law has been remarkably effective in reducing the incidence of childhood lead poisoning. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report. Healthy People 2010. the decline in childhood lead poisoning in the United States represents a major public health success. The Residential LeadBased Paint Hazard Reduction Act directed HUD to establish regulations for the evaluation of lead hazards. In its regulation. referred to as the LeadSafe Housing Rule. HUD established an environmental intervention blood level .of 20 micrograms per deciliter for a single test or 15 to 19 micrograms per deciliter for two tests taken at least 3 months apart. H.R. 6309 will require HUD to issue new regulations that adopt the level of 10 micrograms per deciliter. Eliminating lead exposure greater than 10 micrograms of. lead per deciliter of blood among children by the year 2010 is one of the national health objectives established by the Department of Health and Human Resources. Mr. ELLISON is to be commended for his commitment to strengthen the definition of a childs elevated blood lead level. and I recommend my colleagues support this legislation. Madam Speaker.

Description of how the money will be spent and why the use of federal taxpayer funding is justified: (BRAMAE) is a critical decision and training aid for commanders and operators to use in support of military operations on urbanized terrain (MOUT). BRAMA is an integrated collection. planning. and course of action system. It integrates existing US Army developed blast nodeling software with a state of the art 4D (Lat. Long. Alt. and Time) visualization front end. It is used by the Army to simulate blast analysis and vulnerability assessments. BRAMA provides decision support for antiterrorism/force protection (AT/FP) and critical infrastructure protection (CIP). BRAMA is a royaltyfree tool and requires minimal training. It leverages previous US Army and US Air Forceforce/facility protection R&D efforts. Starting in 2007. the BRAMA capabilityalong with traininghas been provided to active duty Army. Homeland Security and National Guard representatives from 7 states. The US Army CONOPS for Force Protection highlights the need for a Capabilities Based Assessment (CBA) tool. Additionally. user feedback postdelivery on BRAMA specifically asks for enhancements on the speed at which facility data can he generated and visualized. Research conducted by the Army in 2006 and 2007 has identified a candidate commercial technology that can be integrated into the BRAMA baseline to meet the CONOPS and speed up the collection process. BRAMA has demonstrated its usefulness to commanders. planners. and security forces by employing fulldimensional display technology to visualize. analyze and remediate blast effects generated by DoDapproved blast models. BRAMAE will extend that capability by simplifying the case of use and helping the Army meet its goal to field a unit level Capabilities Based Assessment (CBA) tool. Description of matching funds: Not Applicable. Authorized Amount: $4.000.000. Project Name: Blast and Damage Assessment Risk Analysis and Mitigation ApplicationEnhancements (BRAMAE). Funding Source: Army. RDT&E. Line 177. PE # 0305208A (Distributed Common Ground/ Surface Systems).

1110056319,"Madam Speaker. our country has always been the worldi innovation leader. and I believe innovation and not taxation must be the answer to the energy challenges we face. Thats why I support the Forbes amendment which would substitute this bill with a new Manhattan project for energy independence. bringing together the bestand brightest minds of a new generation of scientists. engineers and researchers in a unified national challenge just as we did with the original Manhattan project in World War II. Like the first project. which was launched to ensure the security of our country. today our national security depends on our ability to produce reliable. costeffective and environmentally friendly sources of energy to fuel our economy. This project would award significant cash -prizes to the first person or entity to achieve set energy goals. such as doubling car fuel efficiency to 70 mpg while keeping vehicles affordable. cutting home and business energy usage in half. making solar power work at the same cost as coal. making the production of biofuels costcompetitive with gasoline. safely and .cheaply storing carbon emissions from coalpowered plants. safely storing or neutral-. izing nuclear waste. and producing usable electricity from a nuclear fusion reaction. Just like the challenge of the space program to put a man on the moon in a decade. I believe by working together. a new Manhattan project could transform our nations energy security.

1110009784,"Madam Speaker. today I have reintroduced a bill to amend and reauthorize the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000. In the 110th Congress. I joined my colleague. Congressman ENI FALEOMAVAEGA of American Samoa. in introducing H.R. 1205. the ""Coral Reef Conservation Amendments Act of 2007"". which the House of Representatives passed by voice vote on October 22. 2007. The bill I have introduced today. with Congressman FALEOMAVAEGA and 15 other colleagues. strengthens H.R. 1205 without changing its original intent. Conservation of coral reef ecosystems is essential to protect public health. promote environmental sustainability. and ensure longterm economic progress for the jurisdictions we represent in Congress. The sovereign waters of the United States off the coast of Guam. and in the Pacific region as a whole. contain a majority of the shallowwater coral reefs in the United States. as well as some of the worlds greatest coral reef biodiversity. These reefs. and reefs around the world. protect us from storm waves. provide habitat and shelter for fisheries. provide food and recreation for our residents. and are the basis for marine tourism industries. Today. however. various pressures on the worlds reefs threaten to destroy them and the numerous ecosystem services that they provide. Unless the United States acts in conjunction with the global community to support focused. prolonged action on coral reef education. research. and management. the condition of our coral reefs will continue to degrade. Since its enactment in 2000. the Coral Reef Conservation Act has stimulated a greater commitment to protect. conserve. and restore coral reef resources within jurisdictional waters of the United States. As a result. we now have a much better grasp of the condition of our coral reefs. and more focused management capability than at any time in our history. The Coral Reef Conservation Act Reauthorization and Enhancement Amendments of 2009 would further strengthen the original legislation by establishing a new communitybased planning grants program. by promoting international cooperation. and by recognizing the important contributions of the U.S. Department of the Interior in coral reef management and conservation efforts. This bill would also codify the United States Coral Reef Task Force established in 1998 by President Clinton through Executive Order 13089. The work of the Task Force and its mission to coordinate the efforts of the United States in promoting conservation and the sustainable use of coral reefs internationally is vital to our interests. Since 1998. the Task Force has acted to facilitate and support better management and conservation of coral reef resources at the local level. Many beneficial efforts. such as the development and implementation of local action strategies to address threats to our reefs. are underway thanks to the work of the Task Force and its member agencies. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advance this legislation to enhance our capacity for the conservation and restoration of healthy and diverse coral reef ecosystems. our ""Rainforests of the Sea"".",,,,,,,,,,E,2009-02-04,1119,Ms. BORDALLO,Unknown,BORDALLO,Unknown,F,73222,73297,02042009.txt,3164,492,111,2009,reintroduc reauthor coral reef conserv congressman eni faleomavaega samoa introduc hr coral reef conserv repres octob introduc congressman faleomavaega strengthen hr without conserv coral reef ecosystem health promot environment ensur longterm econom progress repres sovereign water coast guam pacif region whole contain shallowwat coral reef well world greatest coral reef biodivers reef reef around world us storm wave provid habitat shelter fisheri provid food recreat resid basi marin tourism industri variou pressur world reef threaten destroy ecosystem provid unless conjunct global commun focus prolong coral reef research condit coral reef continu degrad sinc coral reef conserv stimul greater conserv restor coral reef water result better grasp condit coral reef focus capabl histori coral reef conserv reauthor enhanc strengthen establish new communitybas plan program promot intern recogn import contribut us depart coral reef conserv effort also codifi coral reef task forc establish clinton execut work task forc mission coordin effort promot conserv coral reef intern vital interest sinc task forc facilit better conserv coral reef local level benefici effort develop implement local strategi threat reef underway work task forc look work side aisl advanc enhanc capac conserv restor healthi divers coral reef ecosystem rainforest sea,284,0.31547619047619047,0.20869565217391303
1110056263,Madam Speaker. I rise today in strong opposition to the energy tax recklessly being forced through the legislative process only to harm small business owners. farmers. and families in Missouri. As a 6th generation farmer I can tell you that it is an extremely energy intensive practice. Sixtyfive percent of a farmers costs are dedicated to electricity. fuel. fertilizer. and chemicals. even a slight increase in costs would have a damaging effect on farmers. When it comes to rising fuel prices. we farmers drive trucks because we have to haul stuff. I would challenge any of my colleagues to come to Missouri and try doing farm chores in a Prius. Those claiming this bill benefits agriculture dont know a thing about the business. Agriculture producers are price takers on both ends of the equation. It is one of the few industries in the world that purchases its inputs at retail to sell its end product at wholesale. Farmers have very little ability to pass their own costs onto their customers and even those costs that agriculture producers can pass on will mean only one thing: higher food prices for American families. Rising food prices will be an indirect tax imposed on American families by this Cap and Tax bill and its effects wont just be confined to agriculture. Business everywhere will be confronted by a new dueling reality of seeing their own energy costs rise and the disposable income of their customers fall. All this can accomplish is to restrain future economic growth and lead to longterm joblessness. That is if there* are any jobs left. None of the regulations or increased costs in this bill will be shouldered by our trading partners and competitors. How can we expect our businesses to remain competitive and create jobs when we are imposing new taxes not only on those same businesses. but their customers as well? Lets be honest with ourselves. This legislation is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to address climate change. while its actual goal is to direct more taxpayer dollars to the government coffers to fund a big government agenda. including the federal takeover of health care. Today I strongly urge my colleagues to stand with me. It is irresponsible of Congress to use taxation as an answer to our nations challenges. Voting against this bill will demonstrate your willingness to work together towards real energy solutions for our future and our childrens future.,,,,,,,,,,H,2009-06-26,629,Mr. GRAVES,Unknown,GRAVES,Unknown,M,61161,61220,06262009.txt,2417,407,111,2009,rise strong energi recklessli forc harm small owner farmer famili gener farmer extrem energi intens percent farmer dedic electr fuel fertil chemic even increas damag effect farmer come rise fuel price farmer drive truck haul stuff challeng come tri farm chore priu claim benefit agricultur dont know agricultur produc price taker equat industri world purchas input retail sell product wholesal farmer onto custom even agricultur produc mean higher food price famili rise food price indirect impos famili cap effect wont confin agricultur everywher confront new duel realiti see energi rise dispos incom custom fall restrain futur econom growth lead longterm jobless job left none increas shoulder trade partner competitor expect competit job impos new custom well honest thinli veil attempt climat goal direct taxpay coffer fund big agenda includ takeov health care strongli stand irrespons answer nation challeng demonstr willing work togeth toward real energi solut futur children futur,217,0.267515923566879,0.20869565217391303
1100197858,Mr. Speaker. as the House considers tax legislation to promote the development and deployment of alternative and renewable energy technologies. I rise today in support of the proposed plugin electric drive motor vehicle tax credit and. in particular. making the tax credit even more robust and immediate by including in the credit roadcertified twowheel vehicles and lowspeed neighborhood electric vehicles. I support the underlying bill. but hope as it progresses that this clean energy incentive may also be included. I know that House Ways and Means Committee Chairman RANGEL and the House Leadership are committed to renewing existing energy tax provisions and enacting new incentives for environmentallyfriendly. domestic energy production. And I believe that the tax credit for plugin electric drive vehicles is a critical component of that commitment. This tax credit will encourage the ongoing efforts to develop and bring to the marketplace the technology that will be necessary for these vehicles to become a common occurrence on our roads and highways. Tailpipe emissions from the combustion of gasoline and diesel fuel are by far the largest contributors to climate change and the air quality problems that exist in many regions of our country. This tax credit will go directly at addressing these issues by displacing foreign oil with electricity that is domestically produced withit -is my hopea significant and growing renewable component. The plugin electric drive vehicle tax credit is so vital to our alternative and renewable energy priorities that it should begin working as soon as it is enacted. but it can only do so by expanding the credit to include both roadcertified twowheel vehicles and lowspeed neighborhood electric vehicles. which are now in retail production. These vehicles are specifically designed to address the shorthaul transportation needs of urban and suburban communities. Because the first mile of a trip creates the most tailpipe emissions. these vehicles can play an important and significant role in mitigating the unique contribution of urban and suburban transportation to our air quality and climate change problems. If enacted. the plugin electric drive motor vehicle tax credit will be an important element of our policy to encourage the development and deployment of alternatives to the consumption of foreign oil. As the manufacturers of electric drive twowheel and lowspeed vehicles already are demonstrating. this policy also has the added benefit of creating quality jobs here in the U.S. While the technology for plugin electric cars is still being developed. roadcertified twowheel vehicles and lowspeed neighborhood electric vehicles can begin reducing our reliance on foreign oil today. and including these vehicles in the tax credit will help develop a consumer market for them. just as the credit will help create a market for plugin electric automobiles and trucks that are expected to come online in a few years. Again. I thank the Speaker and Chairman RANGEL for their important work on the critical issue of ensuring our Nations energy security.,110120650.0,NEAL,RICHARD,H,MA,M,D,2.0,voting,H,2008-09-16,723,Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts,Unknown,NEAL,Massachusetts,M,53364,53447,09162008.txt,3111,485,110,2008,consid promot develop deploy renew energi technolog rise propos plugin electr drive motor vehicl credit particular make credit even robust includ credit roadcertifi twowheel vehicl lowspe neighborhood electr vehicl underli progress clean energi incent also includ know way mean rangel renew exist energi provis new incent environmentallyfriendli domest energi product believ credit plugin electr drive vehicl compon credit encourag ongo effort develop bring marketplac technolog necessari vehicl becom common occurr road highway tailpip emiss combust gasolin diesel fuel far largest contributor climat air qualiti problem exist region credit directli issu displac foreign electr domest produc withit hopea signific grow renew compon plugin electr drive vehicl credit vital renew energi work soon expand credit includ roadcertifi twowheel vehicl lowspe neighborhood electr vehicl retail product vehicl shorthaul need urban suburban commun first mile trip tailpip emiss vehicl play import signific role mitig uniqu contribut urban suburban air qualiti climat problem plugin electr drive motor vehicl credit import element polici encourag develop deploy consumpt foreign manufactur electr drive twowheel lowspe vehicl alreadi demonstr polici also benefit qualiti job us technolog plugin electr car develop roadcertifi twowheel vehicl lowspe neighborhood electr vehicl relianc foreign includ vehicl credit help develop consum market credit help market plugin electr automobil truck expect come onlin rangel import work issu ensur nation energi,279,0.23841059602649006,0.20869565217391303
1100151548,Mr. President. today I talk about public health. As I hope many of my colleagues are aware. this week is National Public Health Week. and this years goal is to increase the Nations awareness of the serious effects of global warming on the publics health. When I say global warming. people think of many things. You might think of polar bears. vanishing glaciers. or rising sea levels. but you are not likely to think of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is unfortunate because there is a direct connection between global warming and the health of our Nation. A warming planet will affect food. water. shelter. and the spread of infectious diseases. At the same time. we will face more extreme weather events. Storms. floods. droughts. and heat waves will have an acute impact. particularly on hundreds of millions of people in the developing world. Climate change is very much a public health issue. The science behind global warming is no longer debatable. Scientists from around the globe have stated in the strongest possible terms that the climate is changing. and haman activity is to blame. These changes are already dramatically affecting human health around the world. The World Health Organization reported that the climate change which occurred from 1961 to 1990 may already be causing over 150.000 deaths or the loss of over 5.5 million disabilityadjusted life years annually starting in These numbers are staggering. b ut they should not be surprising: clirhate change influences our living environment on the most fundamental level. which means it affects the basic biological funqtions critical to life. It impacts the air we breathe and the food available for us to eat. It impacts the availability of our drinking water and the spread of diseases that can make us sick. Last years Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. IPCC. report on climate change put to rest the arguments of many skeptics. But the frequently cited report of Working Group .One is just one of three separate IPCC reports. Working Group Two simultaneously issued a sobering report on the impacts of climate change. They predicted that up to 250 million people across Africa could face water shortages by 2020. and that agriculture fed by rainfall could drop by 50 percent. Crbp yields in central and SouthAsia could drop by 30 percent. People everywhere who depend on glaciers or snow pack for their drinking water will be forced to find new supplies. This is not speculation. These effects are already measurable. The World Health Organization predicts that asthma deaths will rise by 20 percent over the next 10 years. and that climate change is causing greater outbreaks of Rift Valley fever and the spread of malaria in higher elevations in Africa. and more frequent cholera epidemics in Bangladesh. The CDC is preparing for more heatwave planning and forecasting. The public health costs of global climate change are likely to be greatest to the nations of the world who have contributed least to the problem. As the worlds largest emitter of greenhouse gases. we have a moral obligation to help these countries. which are als6 least likely to have the resources to prepare or respond themselves. Any strategies for managing climate change impacts. must address this unequal burden. and to take in to account their unique challenges and needs. These impacts are different in different parts of the worldand equally troubling. they are disproportionately burdensome for the worlds more vulnerable populations. Children. the elderly. the poor. and those with chronic and other health conditions are the most vulnerable to the negative health impacts of climate change. There is growing recognition that we must act. and we must act now. Fortunately. many of the choices individuals should make for the sake of their healthand the health of their communities--are the same choices that benefit the health of the planet. Making the climate change issue real means helping people understand how the way they live affects themselves and others. whether through their transportation choices. their use of water and electricity or the types of goods they purchase and consume. What is good to reduce global warming is good for public health. and the shift away from fossil fuels and a movement toward general environmental awareness aligns with existing public health goals. Clean. renewable energy means less dependence on fossil fuels. The combination of less coal and cleaner coal leads to a host of health benefits. Fewer particulate emissions mean less asthma. Reduced mercury emissions could lead to fewer developmental disorders. The transportation sector is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases. Encouraging and enabling people to walk. bicycle. or use public transportation reduces vehicle greenhouse gas emissions and improves urban air quality. But it simultaneously improves an individuals health by increasing physical activity. Improving community design to reduce reliance on cars also means less obesity and diabetes. We should be encouraging States to design and create healthy communities. We cannot wait to act. We should all continue to work toward national and international policies which fight global warming. And we will make sure that we act justly and help.the poorest countries. which are hardest hit by this problem. And we can start now. Now is the time to prepare our water. agricultural. and disease prevention systems for a warmer planet. Now is also the time to invest in renewable energy and to build pedestrian and bicycle friendly cities. What is good for the planet is good for public health. and I encourage everyone to remember that solutions to a global problem can have immediate. individual benefits.,110118201.0,MENENDEZ,ROBERT,S,NJ,M,D,,voting,S,2008-04-10,736,Mr. MENENDEZ,Unknown,MENENDEZ,Unknown,M,44365,44542,04102008.txt,5758,930,110,2008,talk health awar nation health goal increas nation awar seriou effect global warm health global warm peopl might polar bear vanish glacier rise sea level like center diseas control unfortun direct connect global warm health nation warm planet affect food water shelter spread infecti diseas face extrem weather event storm flood drought heat wave acut impact particularli million peopl develop world climat health issu scienc behind global warm longer scientist around globe strongest possibl term climat haman blame alreadi dramat affect human health around world world health report climat alreadi caus death loss million disabilityadjust life annual stagger ut surpris clirhat influenc environ fundament level mean affect basic biolog funqtion life impact air breath food avail us eat impact avail drink water spread diseas make us sick last intergovernment panel climat ipcc report climat rest argument skeptic frequent cite report work group three ipcc report work group two simultan issu sober report impact climat predict million peopl africa could face water shortag agricultur fed rainfal could drop percent crbp central southasia could drop percent peopl everywher depend glacier snow pack drink water forc find new suppli specul effect alreadi measur world health predict asthma death rise percent next climat caus greater outbreak rift valley fever spread malaria higher elev africa frequent cholera epidem bangladesh cdc prepar heatwav plan forecast health global climat like greatest nation world contribut least problem world largest emitt greenhous gase moral help al least like prepar respond strategi climat impact unequ burden take uniqu challeng need impact part worldand equal troubl disproportion burdensom world vulner popul children elderli poor chronic health condit vulner neg health impact climat grow recognit fortun choic individu make sake healthand health communitiesar choic benefit health planet make climat issu real mean help peopl understand way affect whether choic water electr good purchas consum good global warm good health shift away fossil fuel movement toward gener environment awar align exist health goal clean renew energi mean depend fossil fuel combin coal cleaner coal lead host health benefit fewer particul emiss mean asthma mercuri emiss could lead fewer development sector largest sourc greenhous gase encourag peopl walk bicycl vehicl greenhous emiss improv urban air qualiti simultan improv individu health increas physic improv commun relianc car also mean obes diabet encourag healthi commun wait continu work toward nation intern polici fight global warm make sure justli helpth poorest hardest hit problem prepar water agricultur diseas warmer planet also invest renew energi build pedestrian bicycl friendli citi good planet good health encourag everyon solut global problem individu benefit,536,0.1832797427652733,0.20866141732283464

There are many Federal energy efficiency provisions that are part of the American Clean Energy and Security Act. And in terms of what they mean to American families. the estimates are that American families will save $750 per year per household within 10 years because of the energy efficiency provisions of this bill.

1110014247,"Mr. President. I rise today to introduce a bill to establish an* Indian Development Finance Corporation as an independent. Federallychartered corporation that is modeled after the family of Development Banks established by the World Bank in lesserdeveloped countries around the world. Mr. President. in my more than 30 years of service on the U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. I have visited many Indian communities and Alaska Native villages. and I have seen that in many parts of Indian country. there are economic and social conditions that are as dire as those conditions found in the socalled ""lesser developed countries"" around the world. And although we have seen some economic success in recent years across Native America as a result of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. most Indian tribes and Native villages are not engaged in the conduct of gaming. nor have tribal governments found the means to overcome the challenges associated with their remote locations from populations centers and market places that serve the .commerciallysuccessful tribal gambling operations. In those rurallyisolated areas. there is real potential to succeed in developing viable local economies based on agricultural and fishery resources. and the development of the vast energy resources that are located on Indian lands. What these Native communities need is the type of development financing services that the World Bank has successfully establishedinstitutions empowered to make small. leveraged capital investments and economic infrastructure development to support tailored industrial programs. internetbased communication services. national and international trade agreements. and economic research capabilities. An Indian Development Finance Corporation could provide these kinds of services through a network of centers that would be based in Indian Country. Under this bill. the Corporation would be authorized to issue 500.000 shares of common stock at $50 per share to every Tribal Nation in Indian Country and Alaska. The Corporation would be managed by a Board elected .by the Tribal shareholders and the Board. would be charged with hiring a .President and a team of managers as well as set operating policies. Seed capital would be injected into the Indian Development Finance Corporation (IDFC) by the U.S. Treasury in exchange for the issuance of capital stock. Initially. $20 million in startup funds would be invested and after the majority of common stock was purchased by tribes. another $80 million would be authorized. I believe that the IDFC can take advantage of opportunities to integrate the economic stimulus activities soon to be created by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. and. I am confident that there will be support forthcoming from those tribal governments and Alaska Native corporations that have the resources to invest in the economic infrastructure initiatives that will be established by the IDFC in this period of our greatest need.

1110034017,Mr. Speaker. I rise today to recognize National Healthy Schools Day. which is being celebrated around the country today. National Healthy Schools Day recognizes the importance of having a clean and healthy indoor environment in our Nations schools. And today I introduced a House resolution officially recognizing National Healthy Schools Day. Some 54 million children spend their days in our Nations schools. half of which have problems with indoor air quality. Children are more vulnerable than adults to environmental hazards in their schools because of their developing immune systems and small bodies. Poor indoor environmental quality has been linked to asthma and other illnesses..in children. With one out of every 13 children suffering from asthmathe number one cause of missed school daysit is very important that we address this issue. Healthy and highperformance schools are the answer to this problem. They reduce indoor environmental hazards and are -energy efficient.

I saw the enormous potential of job creation this weekend In Seattle. Washington. where I went to the MacDonaldMiller Company. a company that installs highly efficient energy efficiency heating and cooling systems. where they have found they can reduce energy usage by 12 percent simply by putting in a system that will adjust the energy depending on what the temperature is outside. Now if we could get huge efficiency measures like that and put hundreds of people to work. like they are doing at MacDonaldMiller. were going to find that we can grow our economy wlile solving global climate change as well. The energy bill we will do will require 15 percent clean energy and 5 percent efficiency. Thats a vision for the future. Were going to pass President Obamas clean energy jobs plan.

1100196573,Mr. President. our national energy situation is continuing to deteriorate. Petroleum and gasoline prices have set all time records. and our oil imports are responsible for an incredibly large wealth transfer from America to global oil producers. Our most immediate and visible energy challenges are adequate supplies and record prices for fuels in our transportation sector. but natural gas and coal prices also have risen to new plateaus. and these are impacting both electricity prices and manufacturing and delivery costs across our economy and society. We have yet to tackle the problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. the large majority of which result from the combustion of fossil fuels. The environmental impacts of energy use. especially from autos and power plants. are still a major health concern. In short. we need to initiate a major transition of our energy sector. to one that is far more efficient. is much less reliant on fossil fuels and imported oil. and is utilizing vastly more domestically produced renewable fuels and energy. Americans recognize the magnitude and the urgency of our energy challenges. They rightfully expect us to adopt policies to move this energy transition forward. In particular. we need to reduce dependence on oil in transportation. and we have broad agreement on two fundamental approachesincreasing efficiency of vehicles and increasing use of alternative fuels. However. in expanding the use of alternative fuels. we face the challenge of needing both alternative fueling stations and vehicles that can use these fuels. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 calls for a brisk expansion of the production and use of biofuels. and it promotes the expansion of the ethanol distribution and sales infrastructure. In parallel. we need to rapidly expand the number of dual fuel automobiles. including in particular autos that can be fueled with any blend of gasoline and ethanol ranging from zero to 85 percent ethanol. Today I am joined by my esteemed colleague. Senator LUGAR of Indiana. in introducing the Dual fuel Automobile Act of 2008. This bill will expand the number of dual fuel automobiles at a rapid pace while not imposing undue production cost challenges or our auto manufacturers. It calls for 50 percent of all lightduty vehicles manufactured for sale in the United States to be dual fuel automobiles by 2011. It increases that to 90 percent of all lightduty vehicles manufactured for U.S. sales by 2013. These requirements are reasonable because it is known that gasoline vehicles require relatively minor changes in fuel system designs to be able to use blends of gasoline and ethanol which qualify them for dual fuel designation. This mandate will ensure that the number of dual fuel automobiles in our transportation fleet is expanding apace with the expansion of ethanol production and use in our national fuel supply over the next 15 years and beyond. Taken together. our increasing production of biofuels. our incentives for installation of alternative fuel infrastructure. lightduty vehicle requirement will provide Americans the option of choosing clean. domesticallyproduced fuels for their personal transportation needs in the future. This represents a critical component in the transition of our energy systems away from fossil and imported fuels toward reliance on sustainable domestic fuel sources. Today I urge my Senate colleagues to join us in taking action to boost the transition to a cleaner. more resilient. and more secure energy economy. I request support for this bill and its rapid enactment. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the RECORD.,110117411.0,HARKIN,THOMAS,S,IA,M,D,,voting,S,2008-09-12,88,Mr. HARKIN,Unknown,HARKIN,Unknown,M,5770,5874,09122008.txt,3673,583,110,2008,nation energi situat continu deterior petroleum gasolin price import respons incred larg wealth america global produc visibl energi challeng suppli price fuel sector natur coal price also risen new plateau impact electr price manufactur deliveri economi tackl problem greenhous emiss larg result combust fossil fuel environment impact energi especi auto plant health concern short need transit energi sector far effici reliant fossil fuel import vastli domest produc renew fuel energi recogn magnitud urgenc energi challeng expect us polici move energi transit particular need depend broad two fundament approachesincreas effici vehicl increas fuel expand fuel face challeng need fuel station vehicl fuel energi independ call brisk expans product biofuel promot expans ethanol distribut infrastructur need rapidli expand dual fuel automobil includ particular auto fuel blend gasolin ethanol rang zero percent ethanol esteem introduc dual fuel automobil expand dual fuel automobil rapid pace impos product challeng auto manufactur call percent lightduti vehicl manufactur dual fuel automobil increas percent lightduti vehicl manufactur us known gasolin vehicl rel minor fuel blend gasolin ethanol dual fuel ensur dual fuel automobil fleet expand apac expans ethanol product nation fuel suppli next beyond taken togeth increas product biofuel incent instal fuel infrastructur lightduti vehicl provid choos clean domesticallyproduc fuel need futur repres compon transit energi away fossil import fuel toward relianc domest fuel sourc us take boost transit cleaner resili energi economi rapid consent print,336,0.3489583333333333,0.208
1110051380,Mr. Chair. I rise in support of Mr. NUNES amendment. The National Marine Fisheries Services Biological Opinion on the Central Valley Water Project and State Water Project is flawed because it attributes the pumps as a single factor in the decline of fisheries in the Bay Delta. Numerous regulatory measures under the Endangered Species Act. the Central Valley Project Improvement Act and the Clean Water have already resulted in over 50 percent cuts to water deliveries. yet havent resulted in any improvement to the fisheries. The interim court orders under which this BO is based and a previous Biological Opinion on the delta smelt have slashed deliveries to just 10 percent. and we still are not seeing any improvement to the fisheries. Implementing the Biological Opinion truly is the -definition of insanity--doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. We cannot solve the challenges of the Delta ecosystem by continuing to curtail pumping. We are long overdue for a study that examines all of the factors affecting the Delta. such as nonnative fish that are predators of endangered species. climate change. and pollution such as discharged wastewater. It is imperative we undertake a complete study that identifies all of these factors and then set policy according to a complete set of data. To continue to curtail pumping prevents a true solution. The cumulative effect of this Biological Opinion and other regulatory decisions is crippling small farm communities in the San Joaquin Valley. The San Joaquin Valley has an average unemployment rate hovering near 20 percent. with some communities at 45 percent. This is one more strike in what is an economic disaster for my constituents.,111116270.0,CARDOZA,DENNIS,H,CA,M,D,18.0,voting,H,2009-06-17,513,Mr. CARDOZA,Unknown,CARDOZA,Unknown,M,32275,32315,06172009.txt,1725,279,111,2009,rise nune nation marin fisheri biolog opinion central valley water project water project flaw attribut pump factor fisheri bay delta regulatori measur endang speci central valley project improv clean water alreadi result percent cut water deliveri havent result improv fisheri interim bo previou biolog opinion delta smelt slash deliveri percent see improv fisheri implement biolog opinion truli insanitydo expect result challeng delta ecosystem continu curtail pump long overdu examin factor affect delta nonn fish predat endang speci climat pollut wastewat imper undertak complet identifi factor polici complet data continu curtail pump true solut cumul effect biolog opinion regulatori decis crippl small farm commun san joaquin valley san joaquin valley averag unemploy rate hover percent commun percent strike econom disast,151,0.26666666666666666,0.2077922077922078
1110043307,Mr. Speaker. the crazy capandtax idea advanced by my liberal colleagues would create $640 billion in new taxes on American businesses and raise electrical bills by $3.100 per household per year. This capandtax proposal creates an artificial market to find revenue to pa. for various social programs that this administration plans to enact. such as government takeover of our health care. This boondoggle will cap* our growth and trade our jobs. Companies looking to invest in our economy Will simply move overseas to escape this enormous tax increase. You dont believe me? Look ii the crystal ball at Spain. which has been on this plan for 10 years. After losing a number of companies. seeing utility prices skyrocket and suffering a 17.5 percent unemployment rate. we can see our future clearly. Even worse. experts tell us that capandtax will do nothing to cap greenhouse gases. but it will put the United States at a. global economic disadvantage becauseChina! and India will ignore this scheme.

1100141060,Mr. Speaker. it is clear that President Bush is out of touch with todaysconsumer. First. he refused to accept that the economy was heading in a downturn. Now. it takes a reporters question for him to realize that gas prices in this country will soon reach $4 a gallon at the pump. Despite being reported in newspapers around the Nation. President Bush has told reporters last week that he didnt realize that $4 gas was possible. The Presidents energy record leaves a great deal to be desired. Since hQ took office. gas prices have doubled. and home heating costs have tripled. While President Bush remains out of touch. House Democrats acted last week to ease some of that burden. We passed legislation that repeals unnecessary tax subsidies to big oil companies. which reported record profits last year and last month. Instead. the subsidies will go towards tax incentives for clean. renewable energy. Mr. Speaker.

They want us to give more public land to Big Oil. even though 68 million acres of land are already leased and not being developed. Today. the House will consider the DRILL Act. I urge my colleagues to join us in passing this vital legislation that will speed up development of NPRA. require Big Oil to use the land they have leased or lose it. and ban foreign export of Alaskan oil to ensure our oil stays in America.

It is conceivable that the Civil Air Patrol could contribute to border security. search and rescue and responsive activities at DHS. Additionally. it would be interesting to know whether the Civil Air Patrol can provide emergency transport for sensitive medical materials. I would also be interested to know whether the Civil Air Patrol area reconnaissance and communications capability can enhance our border security and DHSs ability to have situational awareness of natural disasters and other manmade events.

New technology drives new jobs. markets. and economic opportunity. which is why we set $4.8 billion aside for the sciences in the Office of Science. It is a national security issue. energy is. given where we buy so much of our petroleum products from. which is why we decided to invest in new vehicle technology to the extent of $273 million so we can get more miles per gallon. setting aside the issue of Yucca. investing $792 million in nuclear energy. and doing extensive biomass research.

1100136554,Mr. Speaker. ExxonMobil recently announced that they have earned over $40 billion in 2007. the highest profits ever for a U.S. company. Of course. we want our U.S. companies to succeed in the global marketplace. but hugely profitable oil companies certainly dont need taxpayer subsidies. especially as the price of oil continues to hover at $100 a barrel. I want to urge my colleagues. it was none other than President Bush who said that with oil at $50 a barrel. he saw no need for the kind of subsidies put in the 2005 energy bill by the Republican Congress. My constituents are fed up that oil companies are reaping billions in profits while hardworking Americans are suffering from a slowing economy. Now is the time to level the playing field by removing Big Oil tax breaks and advancing clean technologies that will create green collar jobs and help grow our economy. drive down high energy prices. reduce our dependence on dirty and dangerous fossil fuels. and curb global warming pollution. If we are going to give American consumers more efficient and cheaper energy options. we need to expand the incentives to invest in renewable and alternative energy sources.

1110029622,Madam Chairman. I rise today in support of the Progressive Caucus budget alternative. Budgets are about goals. aspirations. values and vision. This budget sets the right priorities for the future of this Nation. cutting Cold War weapons systems and investing in the future. investing in our veterans. investing in their families and children and in workers and deinvesting in the things that dont work. Investment number one. The lack of affordable health care is the number one drain on our economy. and it must be fixed immediately. The Progressive budget steps up the Presidents commitment by investing nearly $120 billion a year to ensure that every American can have affordable. highquality health care. Investment number two. We need a national commitment to accelerate the development and commercialization of clean. renewable energy sources to get serious about our dependence on fossil fuels. And any climate change policy must recognize that we have to protect the most vulnerable by significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions in a manner that supports economic Security and the health of low- and moderateincome families and communities of color. . The Progressive budget spends $30 billion a year for the ne.xt decade to create 3 million clean energy jobs dedicated to increasing our energy independence and protecting our environment. This is about the future. and the budget takes unprecedented steps to eliminate outdated. and Cold War weapons systems. repeal the Bush tax cuts and make muchneeded investments in our Nations infrastructure. including wastewater and energyefficient transportation systems.

If the priority is jobs. it is stunning to me that were bringing this bill to the floor that will create a national energy tax on every working family and every small business in America. There are several common sense. bipartisan solutions that invest in new. clean and reliable sources of energy. Im supporting a plan that aggressively reduces emissions. promotes conservation. creates jobs and strengthens our environment by promoting nuclear energya zero emissions. -renewable source. It also boosts domestic supplies of both natural gas andoil.

1110048985,Mr. President. I rise today to speak in support of the Algaebased Renewable Fuel Promotion Act. I would first like to thank Senator BILL.NELSON for his leadership on this extraordinary piece of legislation. which gives algaebased biofuels the same tax incentives that cellulosic biofuels currently enjoy. Specifically. the bill would provide a $1.01 per gallon tax credit and offer 50 percent bonus depreciation for property used in the production of algaebased biofuels. In short. this legislation will level the playing field for algae. resulting in enhanced development and commercialization. Recent technological advances have showcased the tremendous potential of algae as a renewable fuel source. Algaebased biofuels can be refined into gasoline. jet fuel and diesel. These fuels are renewable. have a lowcarbon footprint. and can fit seamlessly into our existing energy infrastructure. Additionally. algae does not compete for arable land or potable water. Algae grows best in very sunny climates. making the desert an ideal place for production. and it utilizes saltwater. not freshwater. to grow. It also has a shortlife cycle and high oil content. Algaebased renewable fuels will play an important role in Americas clean energy portfolio. and provide an answer to the question of how we will decrease our dependence on foreign oil and increase our domestic security. Again. I thank my colleague. Senator BILL NELSON. and I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate on this important piece of legislation.

1110070409,"Madam Speaker. I rise today in response to President Obamas expected commitment to the world at the Copenhagen climate change discussion for the United States to reduce carbon emissions by 17 percent by 2020. It is simply ludicrous to think that we can reduce carbon emissions by 17 percent by 2020 without wrecking our economy. I am also concerned about the Administrations socalled endangerment finding to regulate carbon emissions under the Clean Air Act. This is a disastrous move forward to regulate carbon under a law that was clearly not intended to regulate carbon emissions. In many cases. it is not required under this law to take into consideration the impact on the economy. which poses enormous problems. Going further on the science of climate change. in light of the emails that show that scientists have been suppressing information about the scientific proof of climate change. I believe that it is even more important that we take a step back and ensure that we understand the impact of carbon emissions. The trick that scientists have been using to make the data work has been reported as being called. ""trick and hide."" It seems. Madam Speaker. that not only are the scientists ""tricking and hiding"" the American people on the science of climate changes. but the Democratic Majority is ""tricking and hiding"" the truth about the cap and trade bill. The truth about the cap and trade bill is that this bill will increase electricity rates in some states. like Kentucky. as much as 40 percent. Additionally. the cap and trade bill is nothing more than a hidden tax on the American people. I might add that I am not against reducing carbon emissions as I have cosponsored and helped move the Carbon Capture and Sequestration legislation that was sponsored by Congressman BOUCHER and others. It is important that we develop this technology before enacting any regulatory regime to dramatically reduce carbon emissions. These efforts are essential in keeping electricity rates low. However. I am against the President making a commitment that we cannot meet and that China and India will not match. I am also against the Administrations movement to regulate carbon through the Clean Air Act. We must take a step back and study the science on this issue to make certain we get this right and I call on the Administration to do just that. I call on my colleagues to speak up about negative impacts of the ""trick and hide"" bill and urge the Administration not to make any commitments at Copenhagen.",,,,,,,,,,E,2009-12-10,953,Mr. WHITFIELD,Unknown,WHITFIELD,Unknown,M,120919,120983,12102009.txt,2509,425,111,2009,rise respons obama expect world copenhagen climat discuss carbon emiss percent simpli ludicr carbon emiss percent without wreck economi also concern socal endanger find carbon emiss clean air disastr move carbon clearli intend carbon emiss case take consider impact economi pose enorm problem scienc climat light email show scientist inform scientif proof climat believ even import take back ensur understand impact carbon emiss trick scientist make data work report call trick hide seem scientist trick hide peopl scienc climat trick hide truth cap trade truth cap trade increas electr rate like percent cap trade hidden peopl might carbon emiss help move carbon captur sequestr congressman boucher import develop technolog regulatori regim dramat carbon emiss effort electr rate low make meet china india match also movement carbon clean air take back scienc issu make certain get call call neg impact trick hide make copenhagen,214,0.3409090909090909,0.20689655172413793

1110067020,"Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the Nuclear Power 2021 Act. which is cosponsored by Senator MURKOWSKI and Senator UDALL from Colorado. This bill. along with Senator UDALLs bill S. 2052 are designed to give the Department of Energy a set of specific programmatic authorities to help address ways to lower the upfront capital cost of nuclear reactors. The National Academies of Science in their recent Americas Energy Future study determined that by 2030 we will need essentially to double the existing base load power provided by nuclear energy or about another 100 gigawatts. But before we can make such a large and dramatic increase in nuclear energy. I believe we must demonstrate the ability to construct ""firstmover"" reactors in the U.S. that are on cost and schedule. The National Academies likewise confirmed this as one of two principal demonstrations that must be carried out during the next decade to more fully understand the range of available options for controlling carbon emissions from energy production. The other challenge of commensurate importance that they identified is the demonstration of carbon capture and sequestration on a large scale for fossilfuel based energy production. In that regard. the bill I am introducing today addresses the topic of small modular reactors. which are typically rated with a capacity of less than 300 electrical megawatts. and that can be constructed and operated in combination with similar reactors at a single site. These reactors can be less capital intensive than the larger 1.000 megawatt reactors currently being licensed at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. they have the potential to be built in a modular fashion much like our current fleet of nuclear submarines. This bill is similar to the Department of Energys Nuclear Power 2010 program. it concentrates not so much on the research and development of these reactors but demonstrating the ability to license them. Senator UDALLs bill authorizes the Department to conduct research on these reactors with the goal of reducing cost while operating them in a safe and secure fashion. More specifically. this bill authorizes the Secretary of Energy to work in a public private partnership to develop a standard design for two modular reactors. one of which will not be more than 50 megawatts. obtain a design certification from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for each design by 2018. and obtain a combined operating license from the Commission by 2021. All of this effort would be cost shared by nonfederal funds and selected under competitive merit review process while emphasizing efficiency. cost. safety and proliferation resistance. The climate change issue we face today is too large to exclude any one technology that can produce energy without emitting carbon dioxide. The National Academies report acknowledges the important role nuclear energy has and must play in a carbon constrained energy world. this bill I hope is another step to address some of the recommendations of this report. I hope my colleagues join me as cosponsors of this legislation. Mr. President.

The loss of depletion allowance and the writeoff of intangible drilling costs will effectively shut down all future drilling for the majority of wells drilled in the continental United States. In a business that is so risky. what is the incentive now to take a risk? It is the wildcat drillers rugged individualism that has made this industry what it is today. keeping our gas prices and the cost of heating our homes as low as it is today. It could be much higher. Independent oil men and women in Northwest Louisiana rely on drilling tax incentives to reinvest capital in their companies and hire employees at good salaries. This legislation will drastically hurt small oil and gas business owners in my district and result in major layoffs of personnel. Less domestic production means more imports. price spikes for consumers at the pump and an increased threat to our national security. Lets take this dangerous antijobs and anticonsumer provision out of the budget bill today.,111119410.0,FLEMING,JOHN,H,LA,M,R,4.0,voting,H,2009-03-06,83,Mr. FLEMING,Unknown,FLEMING,Unknown,M,4385,4441,03062009.txt,1225,203,111,2009,northwest energi mean job propos billion incent vast mom pop loss deplet allow writeoff intang drill effect shut futur drill well drill continent riski incent take risk wildcat driller rug individu industri price heat home low could higher independ women northwest reli drill incent reinvest capit compani hire employe good drastic hurt small owner result layoff domest product mean import price spike consum pump increas threat nation take danger antijob anticonsum provis,116,0.31521739130434784,0.20634920634920634
1100138352,Mr. Speaker. this week the House Democrats will build upon our economic stimulus package by passing an energy bill that is designed to lower prices at the gas pump. which are currently over $3 a gallon. The price of oil is hovering around $100 a barrel and many predict that if we dont act now. its going much higher. The Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act extends and expands tax incentives for renewable energies including renewable electricity and fuel. hybrid cars and energyefficient homes and appliances. By investing in renewable energy. we can take another critical step in reducing our Nations dependence on foreign oil. And at a time when our economy is struggling to produce new highpaying jobs. this legislation will help create hundreds of thousands of new green jobs in renewable energy that will help us provide a cleaner environment for the next generation. Mr. Speaker. our legislation is also fully paid for by repealing $18 billion in tax subsidies that big oil companies continue to receive despite record earnings. Its time Congress modernizes our Nations energy policy by passing this important bill regardless of President Bushs opposition.,110117750.0,MORAN,JAMES,H,VA,M,D,8.0,voting,H,2008-02-26,13,Mr. MORAN of Virginia,Unknown,MORAN,Virginia,M,398,440,02262008.txt,1177,191,110,2008,build econom stimulu packag energi lower price pump current gallon price hover around barrel predict dont higher renew energi energi conserv extend expand incent renew energi includ renew electr fuel hybrid car energyeffici home applianc invest renew energi take anoth nation depend foreign economi struggl produc new highpay job help thousand new green job renew energi help us provid cleaner environ next gener also fulli billion subsidi big compani continu earn modern nation energi polici import regardless bush,120,0.32978723404255317,0.20634920634920634
1110057050,"Mr. Chair. I rise today to oppose an amendment offered by Representative FLAKE to H.R. 3183. the Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2010. This amendment would strike $3 million in funding from the Consortium for Plant Biotechnology Research located in Georgia. I support this funding because of the amazing progress CPBR funded projects have been able to make. CPBR receives a small amount of funding annually and in turn has a competitive selection process to fund projects that further plant biotechnology that impacts the seed. agrochemical. forestry. food. energy. electric power. and other nonfood agriculturebased industries. On average. federal funds to CPBR are matched 130 percent with nonfederal funds. Industry must provide at least 50 percent cash matching. this requirement is not required by federal grants and goes to prove the worthiness of these CPBR projects and expedites their path to the marketplace. It is noteworthy that 372 CPBRfunded research projects have resulted in 129 patents. 67 patent applications pending. 274 licenses. and 5 startup companies. In fact. CPBRfunded projects average 2.5 patents/$1 million of federal funding. This is significantly higher than the university rate of 0.13 patents/one million federal dollars. thats 1900 percent higher. In Hawaii. CPBR funded a professor at the University of Hawaii who developed a process called ""flash carbonization"" which is now patented and has been licensed to several companies including Kingsford. This process uses a large cylindrical reactor to pressurize and heat tires. green waste and municipal solid waste to make a ""biochar"" or charcoal that can be used to enhance soil or burn as a fuel. This technology has spawned two energy companies that are building new environmentally friendly industries and creating high paying jobs in Hawaii. This progress started with a small research grant from CPBR. CPBR supports higherrisk. longerterm environmental research that is essential to innovation. research that companies cannot afford to do on their own. With these federal funds. innovative advancements in environmental and energy research are hastened to the marketplace where they can be implemented. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment offered by Representative FLAKE and vote against its passage.",111115280.0,ABERCROMBIE,NEIL,H,HI,M,D,1.0,voting,H,2009-07-15,451,Mr. ABERCROMBIE,Unknown,ABERCROMBIE,Unknown,M,14900,14956,07152009.txt,2331,356,111,2009,rise oppos repres flake hr energi water develop fiscal strike million fund consortium plant biotechnolog research locat fund amaz progress cpbr fund project make cpbr small amount fund annual competit fund project plant biotechnolog impact seed agrochem forestri food energi electr nonfood agriculturebas industri averag fund cpbr match percent nonfeder fund industri provid least percent cash match prove worthi cpbr project expedit path marketplac noteworthi cpbrfund research project result applic licens startup compani fact cpbrfund project averag million fund significantli higher univers rate patentson million that percent higher cpbr fund professor univers develop call flash carbon licens compani includ kingsford larg cylindr reactor pressur heat green municip solid make biochar charcoal enhanc soil burn fuel technolog spawn two energi compani build new environment friendli industri high pay job progress small research cpbr cpbr higherrisk longerterm environment research research compani afford fund advanc environment energi research hasten marketplac implement oppos repres flake,209,0.2814814814814815,0.20618556701030927
1100186634,"Mr. President. I rise today to support legislation that will provide a 2year moratorium on National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permits for all commercial fishing vessels of any size and for all other commercial vessels less then 79 feet. The legislation requires the EPA. working with the Coast Guard"" to conduct a 15month study during the moratorium period to evaluate the impacts of various discharges from vessels and report their findings to Congress for the purposes of making final decisions on vessel discharge permit requirements. Discharges incidental to the norrial operation of vessels have been exempt from NPDES permits under the Clean Water Act since 1973. The National Pollution Discharge Elimination System was developed for industrial sources of pollution and was not designed for mobile sources. In 2006. the U.S. District Court for Northern California ruled that the EPA exceeded its authority under the Clean Water Act in exempting these discharges and issued an order revoking the exemption and requiring the agency to permit these discharges by September 30. 2008.: The EPA has appealed the decision. but in the meantime. the agency has proposed to permit both recreational and commercial vessels under two general permits. While the EPA has proposed a general permit system that does not require individual permits. all commercial and recreational vessels would still be subject to the regulations. fines. and enforcement and citizen lawsuits of the Clean Water Act. Considering incidental discharges for these vessels have been exempt for the past 35 years. it is hard to support permitting when we have such a dearth of information about what the discharges are. especially for small commercial and recreational boats. The commercial moratorium bill directs the EPA to study the incidental discharges of commercial vessels to determine the volume. type and frequency of various categories and sizes of vessels. It is my sincere hope that after the results of the study are reported to the Senate Environment and Public Works and Commerce Committees. and the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Congress will take action to exempt commercial vessels. as we are now doing for the recreational sector under the Clean Boating Act. The commercial vessels thatwill be included are commercial fishing vessels of any size and other commercial vessels less then 79 feet. I need to clarify that it is my understanding that a: commercial fishing vessel is one that previously or is presently engaged in the harvesting. taking or catching of commercial fish. Many commercial fishing boats in the United States also work as fish tenders and it is my intention that the fishing vessels working in this capacity are also included in the covered vessels under the commercial moratorium bill. I also support S. 2766. the Clean Boating Act of 2008. This legislation exempts recreational vessels from the NPDES permitting while the EPA develops best management practices for this sector. Neither category of vessels has documented discharge levels that have been shown to be harmful to the environment. The court case that required the EPA to develop this permit system was focused on invasive species and ballast water. Neither recreational nor small commercial vessels have ballast tanks and very few are oceangoing vessels. Enactment of this legislation. together with the Clean Boating Act will provide the recreation .sector an exemption and commercial boats a two year waiver with the possibility for exemptions based on the outcome of the discharge study. It was a collaborative. negotiated process that developed the Clean Boating Act and the commercial moratorium legislation. I ask my colleagues to support both of these bills and I ask that they both pass by unanimous consent today.",110120591.0,MURKOWSKI,LISA,S,AK,F,R,,voting,S,2008-07-22,12,Ms. MURKOWSKI,Unknown,MURKOWSKI,Unknown,F,147,270,07222008.txt,3827,603,110,2008,rise provid moratorium nation pollut commerci fish size commerci feet epa work coast guard month moratorium period evalu impact variou report find purpos make final decis incident norrial npde clean water sinc nation pollut develop industri sourc pollut mobil sourc us northern california epa exceed author clean water issu revok epa decis meantim propos recreat commerci two gener epa propos gener individu commerci recreat fine enforc citizen lawsuit clean water consid incident hard dearth inform especi small commerci recreat boat commerci moratorium direct epa incident commerci determin frequenc variou categori size sincer result report environ work infrastructur take commerci recreat sector clean boat commerci thatwil includ commerci fish size commerci feet need clarifi understand commerci fish previous engag harvest take catch commerci fish commerci fish boat also work fish tender fish work capac also includ commerci moratorium also clean boat recreat npde epa develop best sector neither categori level shown harm environ case epa develop focus invas speci ballast water neither recreat small commerci ballast tank oceango togeth clean boat provid recreat sector commerci boat two possibl collabor negoti develop clean boat commerci moratorium consent,330,0.389937106918239,0.20618556701030927
1100166712,Mr. Speaker. it is important to note that the average U.S. farmer provides enough food and fiber for 143 persons. both here in the .United States and internationally. This new farm bill continues agricultural policies which have allowed Americas farmers to help feed the world. I believe that the farm bill promotes agricultural stability and diversification. agriculturebased renewable energy production. and good conservation and land stewardship practices. As with any complicated piece of legislation. there are tradeoffs and concerns. For instance. payment limitation reform progressed. but did not go far enough in my view. Even though Im going to vote to override the Presidents veto. I do commend the administration for its considerable efforts to highlight the need for reform. particularly in the area of payment limitations. Im _also pleased that the farm bill conference report includes three of my initiatives. First. a new rural energy selfsufficiency initiative that would provide grants to rural communities seeking to become energy selfsufficient through the use of renewable sources such as wind and solar and biofuels and biomass. Additionally. theie is a new provision allowing school systems and other governmental institutions to purchase local foods from local farmers. promoting agricultural sustainability and diversification. And there is a change to the valueadded- producer grants program that would help target assistance to farmers with small or midsized farms who develop new uses and creative marketing strategies for their product. Mr. Speaker. the development of this important legislation has taken several years. This ground has been plowed long enough. I believe this bill deserve merit. I wish to thank our ranking member.

1100166025,Thank you for asking that question. If you read the comments by T. Boone Pickens on the front page of the New York Times and other newspapers and magazines recently. he. one of the original oil tycoons and more successful ones. has said that hes more excited now about wind power than he is about any oil field he ever discovered. Now. all people might not share his excitement. I talked to Ted Turner. whos been a media mogul and then head of record companies. broadcasting companies. Time Warner/AOL. I believe. I remember him back when he was sailing Americas Cup yachts. Hes certainly been around the world for a while. But today he said the thing hes most excited about as an investor and as a businessman is solar power. And I see these men and women who have experience and have been observing commodities and observing economies and observing the way the world works and the direction its going looking not just at drilling. I mean. obviously were not going to get out of our dependence or our use of oil or liquid fuels anytime soon. especially for aviation. As a member of the Aviation Subcommittee. Im keenly aware of the fact that we might be able to move to electric vehicles. to hybrid. gaselectric or ethanolelectric or biodiesel hybrid. plugin hybrid vehicles. et cetera. and combine these other technologies on the ground. But when were talking about aircraft. especially I would say our Air Force. our military aircraft. we need to be able to develop and conserve liquid fuels and liquid petroleum fuels for those purposes and not burn them unnecessarily on the ground that we could use other technologies for. So I would say that I agree to a point and I disagree to another point. The other problem with petroleumbased. carbonbased. fossil fuel technologies is that theyre also emitting carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and accentuating the kind of climate change that weve seen. I would say climate change resonates more with people than global warming. especially on a day like today in Washington where its cool for late May. But weve seen the cyclone in Myanmar. Weve seen the almost biblical flooding in Arkansas and Missouri and parts of our Midwest. My district in upstate New York has seen three 50year floods in the last 5 years. Weve seen Hurricane Katrina. We have seen droughts in the South and wildfires in Florida right now. Weve seen the last couple of summers devastating fire seasons in the Western States and the Rocky States. So. its not just that the climate will be getting warmer and the glaciers or sea ice in the Arctic are disappearing but *that the extremes of all kinds of weather. be they rain events or drought events. be they hot spells or cold spells. be they low pressure systems that turn into bigger tornados or bigger hurricanes or cyclones. thats what the computer models project. And the more we burn oil. the more we push ourselves down that road. So. it helps us in a number of ways to look at these alternatives. First of all. for domestic. they are. not sending our money overseas by the billions. especially borrowed money that we are getting from countries like China or Japan or other countries were already hugely in debt to. They dont cause asthma acid emphysema and acid rain and oil spills. They dont cause us to possibly be drawn into wars in unstable countries in unstable parts of the world that just happen to have oil. So its a winwinwinwin situation. Whether or not you believe that the climate is changing. the fact of the matter is if you can create jobs and create new technologies and new industries here in the United States. get us out of our balance of trade deficit and make the atmosphere cleaner at the same time. Im happy. And I think a lot of Americans would be happy. too. I think it solves so many problems that its clearly the direction our policy should be moving in.

1100171131,Mr. President. as the American public observes and listens to the debate on climate change and global warming. I think there are probably three fundamental questions everybody wants answered. The first question is an obvious one. and that is: Is climate change occurring? Is global warming a fact and a reality that we need to deal with? I think you have to assume the answer to that question is yes. There are changes going on in our climate. on our planet. some of which we can explain and some of which we cannot explain. Honestly. I will use South Dakota as a case in point. We have experiencedprobably for the last decadesuccessive and continuous years of drought. Yet. this year. in May. we had the wettest year in western South Dakotain Rapid Cityever since they started keeping historical records. So there are changes that occur that have to be viewed in the context of timenot just a decade period but a hundred- or thousandyear periodto determine what are the causes of the changes we are seeing in the climate. We had. in South Dakota. the coldest April this year we have had historically. going back 50 to 100 years. and blizzards into the month of May. So there are a lot of changes that are going on. some of which I think can be explained and some of which cannot be explained. We need to look at them in the broader context of what has happened over a long period of time with respect to our climate. The second question the American people would ask is this: If. in fact. climate change is occurringand we assume the answer to that is yesis human activity contributing to that? If we. again. assume the answer to this question is yes. then we have to get to the next question. I think. frankly. I would answer. if we look at the question of whether human activity is contributing to that. we cannot put our heads in the sand. Obviously. changes are occurring. We assume that the presence of humanity on this planet and some of the things we are emitting into the atmosphere are creating changes. I think we need to acknowledge that. That leads to the next question that I think has become the focus of the debate in the Senate. and that is this question: If the answer to question No. 1 is yes. it is occurring. and 2. it is occurring at least on some leveland we dont know how to quantify that because of human activitywhat are .we going to do about it and at what cost? That is really the focal point of the debate in the Senate today. In my view. there are many problems associated with the bill currently under consideration on the floor of the Senate. First off. it provides a minimal environmental benefit since it is a unilateral solution. China has exceeded us in terms of C02 emissions. It will not get them to stop their C02 emissions because the United States chooses to implement a capandtrade program. So you dont gain environmental benefit. In fact. it could likely have some profound and devastating impacts on our economy. With regard to the first point about the other polluting countries around the world. this was said recently by President Clinton with regard to the Kyoto protocol. He said that 170 countries signed the treaty. and only 6 out of 170 reduced their greenhouse gases to the 1990 level. and only 6 will do so by 2012 at the deadline. These countries signed a binding agreement. and yet they are doing really nothing to get back to the goal or targets called for in that protocol. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the European Union. which began to operate its capandtrade system in 2005. has actually seen carbon dioxide emissions rise by 1 percent per year since that time. Interestingly enough. in the United States. since that same time when Europe implemented their capandtrade system. carbon dioxide emissions have actually declined by about 1 percent. I guess the bigger question here to this last question is. if this is occurring. what do. we do about it and at what cost? We have to think long and hard about that in light of some of the things that are occurring in the country. We have $3.99 gasoline and $4.67 diesel. We have had devastating impacts on the economy in the United States as a result of our dependence upon foreign sources of energy. We need to lessen that dependence and look for technologies that will clean up our environment. Imposing an onerous. burdensome system from the top in which we impose a big tax burden on literally every American. because with $3.99 gasoline and all the studies done by the Energy Information Agencyli studies have been done. all of which have concluded that they will increase gas prices substantially and electricity prices substantially. We have to take a hard look at what the impact will be on our economy. I understand the time for morning business is going to expire. I would like to address some of those impacts as this debate on the climate change legislation gets unaerway. If I could wrap up morning business. I would like to continue with the debate on the climate change legislation. if that would be in order.,110121541.0,THUNE,JOHN,S,SD,M,R,,voting,S,2008-06-05,444,Mr. THUNE,Unknown,THUNE,Unknown,M,24673,24814,06052008.txt,5049,899,110,2008,observ climat global warm three fundament everybodi want answer first climat global warm fact realiti need deal answer climat planet explain explain honestli south case point experiencedprob last decadesuccess continu drought wettest western south dakotain rapid cityev sinc histor context timenot decad period thousandyear periodto determin caus see climat south coldest april histor back blizzard month explain explain need look broader context happen long period respect climat peopl fact climat occurringand answer yesi human contribut answer get next frankli answer look whether human contribut sand obvious presenc human planet emit atmospher need acknowledg lead next becom focu answer least leveland dont know quantifi human activitywhat realli focal point problem associ current consider floor first provid minim environment benefit sinc unilater solut china exceed us term c emiss get c emiss choos implement capandtrad program dont gain environment benefit fact could like profound devast impact economi regard first point pollut around world said clinton regard kyoto protocol said treati greenhous gase level deadlin realli get back goal target call protocol wall street report european union capandtrad seen carbon dioxid emiss rise percent per sinc interestingli enough sinc europ implement capandtrad carbon dioxid emiss percent guess bigger last long hard light gasolin diesel devast impact economi result depend foreign sourc energi need lessen depend look technolog clean environ impos oner burdensom top impos big burden liter gasolin done energi inform agencyli done conclud increas price electr price take hard look impact economi understand morn expir like impact climat get unaerway could wrap morn like continu climat,407,0.28270042194092826,0.20588235294117646

1100197693,I thank the gentleman. The oil and gas industry contributed $166 million to the Republicans since 1990. 75 percent of their political contributions. Fact: When President Bush took office. gas cost $1.47 a gallon. Today gas costs $3.79 a gallon in my district. Fact: In 2002. the oil companies made $30 billion in profits. In 2008. its projected they will make an unbelievable record $160 billion in profits. every penny of that extracted from American consumers and American small businesses and borrowed from overseas. putting us in huge trouble. The oil companies took care of their Republican cronies and the Republicans legislated on their behalf. When they controlled everything. the House. the White House and the Senate. they passed the socalled energy bill. It took them 5 years to write it. And they passed it. Were living with the consequences. which is the huge increase in profits and the huge increase in prices to consumers. The choice is clear. Do we pass a bill written by Democrats who are not beholden to Big Oil. or do we pass another Republican bill. those who legislated this mess in the first place? Do we break our dependence on fossil fuels and mandate renewal energy. or do we ignore the ravages of global warming. drill. dig. burn and borrow our Nation to debt and dust?

H.R. 5819SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act Summary: H.R. 5819 would extend programs that require certain agencies to set aside portions of their research and development budgets for small businesses. The bill also would authorize appropriations to improve. efforts to develop products funded through those programs that can be sold commercially. Finally. the bill would require participating agencies to develop new databases for program evaluation and business development. Based on information from the Small Business Administration (SBA) and other agencies. CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 5819 would cost $263 million over the 20092013 period. subject to appropriation of the spedified and necessary amounts. Enacting the bill would not affect direct spending or revenues.. H.iR. 5819 contains no intergovernmental or privatesector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) and would impose no costs on state. local. or tribal governments. Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated budgetary impact is shown in the following table. The costs of this legislation fall within budget functions 050 (national defense). 250 (general science. space. and technology). 270 (energy). 300 (natural resources and environment). 350 (agriculture). 370 (commerce and housing credit). 400 (transportation). 500 (education. training. employment. and social services). 550 (health). and 750 (administration of justice).

1100157370,As the gentleman knows. my view on this. and I think we would concur. is that I always say growthe size of the energy pie. Take every. slice of that pie. Lets produce more domestic gas. more domestic diesel fuel and more cleaning burning coal. Lets keep wind energy going. and whatever we can do economically with solar. and expand the nuclear. I would expand the hydroelectric if I could do it and add the ethanol and biodiesel to it. I am sure I am leaving somebody out. But if you can find a way to produce energy and get it into the marketplace. biomass is another one. We have got some closed systems coming now where we can take an ethanol plant and ship corn in there. feed the corn. the glutton or the dried distiller grain comes out and gets fed to cattle in the feedlot. it is converted to beef. and then the manure goes into biomass and creates the energy that drives the ethanol plant. It is a closed system. We are developing systems now where we can take the byproduct and convert that into a high concentrated CO2 environment and produce photosynthesis which traps the carbon gas out and turns it into cellulose and energy. We are only in the first phase of renewable energy production. and. as the technology develops. each piece of it as it comes forward to me is just fascinating how far we will be able to go.,110120060.0,KING,STEVE,H,IA,M,R,5.0,voting,H,2008-04-29,478,Mr. KING of Iowa,Unknown,KING,Iowa,M,45603,45639,04292008.txt,1328,247,110,2008,know alway growth size energi pie take slice pie produc domest domest diesel fuel clean burn coal wind energi whatev econom solar expand nuclear expand hydroelectr could ethanol biodiesel sure somebodi find way produc energi get marketplac biomass anoth got close come take ethanol plant ship corn feed corn glutton dri distil grain come get fed cattl feedlot convert beef manur biomass energi drive ethanol plant close develop take byproduct convert high concentr co environ produc photosynthesi trap carbon cellulos energi first renew energi product technolog develop piec come fascin far,118,0.23595505617977527,0.20588235294117646
1100156210,Mr. Chairman. there is no question that America entrusts the Coast Guard to secure and properly maintain and administer Americas waterways and port facilities. The task before this Chamber today is not about oil prices. In fact. its about the Coast Guard and their ability to quickly and effectively respond to intense demands. Americans live along the coast. and they depend upon the Coast Guard to provide that layer of protection and security. In California. where the 11th District resides. 2.600 active and 3.500 volunteer auxiliaries have saved over 500 lives.

1110044901,Ultimately. we need a national energy policy. We dont have that in our country. So youve got very clear differences. The approach that we here that have been talking tonight support is a comprehensive national energy policy that understands that weve got our own national resources like oil. natural gas. We can develop clean coal technology. We can promote more nuclear. and we can use that to fund more solar and wind and other alternative sources of energy. but using our natural resources in America. not shipping jobs overseas like the capandtrade energy tax proposal by our colleagues on the Democratic side.,111121210.0,SCALISE,STEVE,H,LA,M,R,1.0,voting,H,2009-06-02,513,Mr. SCALISE,Unknown,SCALISE,Unknown,M,32165,32181,06022009.txt,614,102,111,2009,ultim need nation energi polici dont youv got clear approach talk tonight comprehens nation energi polici understand weve got nation like natur develop clean coal technolog promot nuclear fund solar wind sourc energi natur america ship job oversea like capandtrad energi propos side,56,0.24444444444444444,0.20588235294117646
1110036778,Madam Speaker. since the Nation has no official energy policy. we continue to discuss what shall we do about energy for the future. The cynics and the critics dont want us to use fossil fuels such as clean coal or oil. They dont want us drilling for even natural gas. We can never build enough of those gangly windmill eyesores to make much of a difference. Solar energy technology is still lagging behind in development. and we are learning that the cornbased ethanol that was to save us all is too much of a pollutant and a poor use of our own land. So what are we to do? Are we going to freeze in the dark or bake in the global heat. depending on whether one believes global warming is fact or fiction? Today I visited the North Anna nuclear power plant in Virginia. I was impressed with their pride for safety. security and competence. This plant. along with 63 others. safely produces 20 percent of our Nations electricity. But France gets 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear power. So we should defy the cynics and the critics and produce energy from all safe sources. including actively pursuing more clean nuclear power. or we will eventually be left behind in the darkness of the winter night.

1100148408,Mr. Chairman. firefighting is a highrisk. highconsequence activity. and the agencies that are involved in managing wildlandurban interface have always had strong firefighter safety and training programs. Firefighter safety is their highest priority. In fact. the 1995 Federal Fire Policy sets the order of priorities for wildland firefighters as. number one. public and firefighter gafety. number two. protection of resources. number three. protection of property. The safety. health. and welfare of firefighters and the general public are becoming increasingly linked to the decline in the health of forested ecosystems. The most effective means of reducing burgeoning fire suppression costs. protecting community values. restoring forest and grassland health. and improving firefighter safety is an aggressive fuel treatment program. How land managers apply the fuels reduction program will have the greatest impact on the safety of wildland firefighters. Threats to human life are compounded by the fact that more and more people are living in homes near fireprone forests. placing themselves and the firefighters who try to protect them at greater risk. My amendment allows the Administrator of the United States Fire Administration to develop and distribute information on . the Importance of clearing biomass from Federal lands. This commonsense amendment requires USFA to work in consultation with other Federal agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service and the BLM to ensure that USFA provides the best possible recommendation. As we come upon what many are predicting to be another deadly and costly fire season. this information will be as vital as ever. We must provide our Federal employees. who are the best in the world. all the tools they need to keep our communities and themselves safe from catastrophic wildfires. The Federal hazardous fuels reduction program can be a very good thing for wildfire fighters. If it is done properly. the program can reduce the most extreme of the hazardous fuels and make the working environment for wildland firefighters much safer. The Federal Government has invested millions of dollars in a hazardous fuels reduction program to mitigate the risks. costs. and consequences of wildfire across millions of acres of publicly owned wildlands. The knowledge gained as to relative effectiveness of different types of treatments and the overall effectiveness of those treatments will have much greater value for protecting and promoting firefighter safety when that information is shared. The United States Fire Administration should be an important vehicle for disseminating this information. and this amendment will help to make that a reality. Mr. WU.

1110027360,Mr. President. I am so pleased to have these 5 minutes to correct the record. First. Senator GREGG takes the floor and says he opposes a national sales tax. that is what cap and trade is. I defy Senator GREGG to show me where there is a national sales tax. This is what is so interesting. A capandtrade system was invented in America to fight acid rain. It has been one of the most successful programs. For acid rain. we used the capandtrade system. and it has worked. By the way. it has worked in the State of Senator GREGG. The other thing I want to put in the record is. Senator GREGG made a statement to my committee in January 2007. He said: I believe Congress must take action to limit the emissions of greenhouse gases from a variety of sources. The overwhelming scientific data and other evidence about climate change cannot be ignored. It is for this reason I have been a strong advocate for mandatory limits on greenhouse gases.

1110058977,Madam Speaker. the Natural Resources Committee has the responsibility not only to take steps to encourage more nuclear. solar. hydropower. and wind energy but also to increase the production of domestic oil and gas. Such an alloftheabove approach will lead to lower energy costs and to more jobs for American citizens while also serving to make our country safer. Later today. the Natural Resources Committee will be holding a hearing on H.R. 3534. a bill which will simply erect more obstacles to job creation and energy production. This bill creates new levels of bureaucracy. which inevitably will slow new development of American sources of energy. Now is not the time to further delay the advancement of American energy.

There have been too many young lives that were lost in those fires. We need to have a solution to that. The States of Colorado and Utah have been working on this program. and it has been effective. Its been effective in saving lives. Its been effective in saving property. Its been effective in alleviating the amount of fuel. the intensity of the fires and. over time. that simply helps our forest. it helps life. it helps the environment. it helps clean the air. and I thank the gentleman from Virginia for actually presenting this amendment.

1110051060,Mr. President. I am pleased that the Senate today will pass the Antitrust Criminal Penalty Enhancement and Reform Act of 2004 Extension Act. ACPERA. I have long supported vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws. Passage of this legislation ensures that the Department of Justice will retain the tools it needs to prosecute criminal antitrust violations effectively and efficiently. Since its inception 5 years ago. ACPERA has bolstered the Department of Justices ability to uncover and prosecute criminal antitrust violations through its leniency program. The act provides incentives for corporations to selfreport antitrust violations by limiting criminal liability and the civil damages recoverable to actual damages against a party that comes forward and cooperates with the Department of Justice. The incentives in this program are critical to the success of the Antitrust Divisions criminal antitrust enforcement. The. 1year extension will allow the Department- of Justice to continue this successful program while Congress assesses the longterm direction of the Department of Justices leniency. program.,111120181.0,LEAHY,PATRICK,S,VT,M,D,,voting,S,2009-06-17,193,Mr. LEAHY,Unknown,LEAHY,Unknown,M,18130,18161,06172009.txt,1112,162,111,2009,pleas crimin penalti enhanc reform extens acpera long vigor enforc ensur depart tool need crimin effect effici sinc incept ago acpera bolster depart uncov crimin lenienc program provid incent corpor selfreport limit crimin damag recover damag parti come depart incent program success divis crimin enforc extens allow depart continu success program assess longterm direct depart lenienc program,97,0.38095238095238093,0.20512820512820512

Because of rising energy prices and limited LIHEAP funding. 62.000 Pennsylvania households that were. supposed to receive funding this year did not. Many of the families across the country who were not able to obtain LIHEAP funds will be forced to decide between paying their energy bill or purchasing other necessities like food or medicine. This is a decision that no hardworking family should have to make. Madam Speaker.

In the midst of these difficult times. jobs are at the top of Americas holiday wish list. yet the President has sent negotiators to Copenhagen to devise and deliver another job killer. Negotiators from nations around the world convened in the Danish capital this week with the goal of developing a successor to the failed Kyoto Protocol. which sought to reduce worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. When Kyoto was negotiated. the Senate unanimously approved the ByrdHagel resolution. This important resolution established U.S. policy that our country would not enter into any climate treaty that leaves out developing nations or hurts the American economy. In passing the resolution. the Senate recognized the damage such an agreement would do to the U.S. economy. The President and his negotiators would be wise to abide by these guidelines today. as any agreement reached in Copenhagen would likely be more devastating to the American economy than Kyoto. But its not just Copenhagen that Americans have to worry about. the President wants to pursue an environmental agenda in any way he can. including through capandtrade. In my view. capandtrade. approved by the House of Representatives in June. remains one of the most damaging pieces of legislation ever passed by the House of Representatives during my time in Congress. especially as it affects agriculture and rural America. The passage of a capandtrade bill will increase the cost of doing business in the United States. will force business owners to close their doors. and will cause companies to leave the country for locations where costs are lower. The respected Heritage Foundation studied the WaxmanMarkey capandtrade bill. The study showed that the legislation would result in annual losses to GDP of almost $400 billion and that it would lead to the loss of 1 million jobs. At a House Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation. Credit. Energy. and Research hearing last week. USDAs chief economist and other experts from universities across the Nation all testified that the costs for fuel. fertilizer and other business inputs would increase under capandtrade. meaning more harm to business and the people they employ. For example. one witness cited an Energy Information Administration analysis that showed. in 2030. the WaxmanMarkey bill would raise diesel fuel costs by 15 percent. electricity costs by 22 percent and industrial natural gas costs by 26 percent. The last thing we need is another law or treaty that dashes the hope for economic recovery and that destroys more jobs. but the President continues to push for just that. On Monday. the EPA ruled that carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases are a danger to public health and to the environment. This decision means EPA can impose greenhouse gas regulations without Congressional action. This threat is no reason to pass capandtrade. We must defeat capandtrade in the Senate and then put an end to the faulty interpretation of the Clean Air Act by the EPA. The President should refrain from entering into international agreements. and the EPA must be stopped from making decisions that are not supported by science or current law. At a time when so many Americans are without work. the President needs to focus on ways to create jobs and to improve the economy. A capandtrade bill. EPA regulations. or an international treaty. all of which are on the Presidents holiday wish list. would be devastating to the U.S. economy. Thats a holiday gift that no American can afford. The passage of capandtrade. an agreement in Copenhagen. clean air findings by the EPAwe can just as soon leave those presents under the Christmas tree unopened. President Obama and Speaker PELOSI. dont be the grinch that steals our Christmas.

1100171487,Mr. President. today I share with my colleagues some thoughts regarding how to reduce worldwide greenhouse gas emissions and a few key benchmarks I believe should be included in a national strategy to address this environmental and economic security challenge. The scientific evidence linking the effects of manmade releases of carbon dioxide and the warming of the Earths climate is clear. In 2007. the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change analyzed the science on climate change and concluded with high probability that the Earth is dramatically warming and that the atmospheric concentration of CO2 is at the highest level in 400.000 years. To forestall the most significant effects of predicted changes in the worlds climate over the next 50 years. the United States and other major emitting nations must begin to transition to a lowcarbon economy. Although South Dakota may avoid the direct consequences of rising sea levels or more powerful storms caused by climate change. in many other respects my State is vulnerable to changes in the Earths temperature. More frequent and severe droughts would dramatically harm the States economy. The loss of productive farmland. denuded pastureland. and scarce ground and surface water supplies are probable under the current scientific modeling on a warming planet. The Prairie Pothole Region. which is partially located in my State. and is the most important duck and geese habitat in North America. is threatened by the effects of climate change. These changes. if borne out in the next generation. would have significant and severe economic consequences for my State. Understanding clearly the probable environmental harm from taking no action. I support a mandatory. nationwide program that limits greenhouse gas emissions. I have voted in support of a nationwide plan previously because it is important to reach agreement and understanding on the complicated legislative. regulatory and economic choices from a nationwide strategy. With the strong. peerreviewed scientific conclusions linking climate change to human caused greenhouse gas emissions. the future uncertainty and cost of a nationwide program to reduce these emissions challenge our path to producing the optimal bill. We need to take strong steps with an early no regrets policy of action. Over the longerterm. addressing this problem will require changes in how we produce and use energy. It is realistic to expect such a plan to have costs. Transiting to lower carbon forms of energy production not yet commercially deployable could increase the price of producing energy. Creating policies and incentives that contain those costs over the next several decades to lessen impacts to consumers is a key concern of mine. A nationwide plan that caps greenhouse gas emissions must make room for the expansion of traditional fossil fuel generation sources to meet growing energy demand. I am a strong supporter of renewable energybiofuels. wind and solar energy can and should make up an increasingly greater share of our countrys energy mix. I support a mandatory. nationwide renewable electricity standard to increase the amount of renewable electricity produced from less than 5 percent currently to a reauirement of 15 percent in the next 10 years. However. we need the full suite of energy resources and that includes natural gas and coal. In my State. we have a diverse mix of energy resources. including hydropower. wind. natural gas and coalfired generation. To keep that available and costcompetitive mix of fuels. a mandatory greenhouse gas reduction program must be linked to an aggressive and dedicated source of funding for reducing the emissions from conventional energy sources. Carbon capture and sequester is a path forward to keep coal as a fuel source. but reduce harmful CO2 emissions. Commercially deployable CCS technology is not yet available. It will take several more years and billions of dollars in research and testing to develop the right types of CCS processes that separate CO2 from the emissions stream. Accordingly. it is important to try to link reductions from existing sources with the likely path of technology development. Is it possible to completely match up reduction targets with technology development? Probably not. Technology develops at an inconsistently timed pace. Nonetheless. a plan that includes an unrealistically optimistic emissions reduction schedule that does not meet up with the resources for nextgeneration emission reduction technologies will break the program and hamper our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Part of the solution to this challenge resides in ensuring that incumbent as well as new entrant fossil fuel generators can manage price and emission reductions and have the resources to invest in new. lowemitting technologies. Allowance distribution should. as one factor. take into consideration historic emissions in allocating emission allowances. A limited and tightly controlled auction and other distribution calculations can be incorporated into this framework. but if we dont get this part of the program right it could swamp our efforts in other parts of the economy to wring carbon from the production process. The good news is that South Dakotans can bring our strengths to contributing to the solution of a low carbon and economically strong America. Farmers. ranchers and forestland owners can play an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Agriculture practices and land management decisions that sequester carbon dioxide are cheap and efficient ways to comply with the requirements of a nationwide and mandatory program. The use of limited offsets and the flexibility of producers and landowners to get credit for past. current and future action target an incentive that eases costs for other sectors of the economy while at the same time creating an income stream for rural America. A ton of carbon sequestered. verified. and accounted is as powerful as reducing a ton of carbon from the smokestack of an electric utility or the smelter from a manufacturing facility. There is a strong coalition of Senators who believe that a vigorous offset program should be part of a comprehensive climate bill. Properly administered. offsets lower costs and improve compliance which is why I am confident that such a plan strengthens the objectives of a low carbon economy. Mr. President. I feel confident the Congress can come together and address these challenges. Those deniers of the problem who throw up obstacles and simply say no to any and all avenues for action will find themselves increasingly marginalized and ineffective as the American people demand a serious response to a serious problem. My objectives and concerns should be viewed as a way to make an eventual policy more equitable and efficient. The consequences of taking no action are dire and simply unacceptable. Although the Congress will not find consensus this year on tackling the problem. I am glad that the Senate has started a much needed debate on this issue and count myself in the vast majority of citizens who feel we have the capability to curtail the effects of climate change.

1100181583,Madam Speaker. I rise today to honor Dr. J. Frederick Grassle on his retirement from the Institute of Marine and Coastal Sciences at Rutgers. the State University of New Jersey. Dr. Grassle served as director of the Institute for 19 years. Under Dr. Grassles direction. the Institute gained a national and international reputation for excellence in marine and coastal research. education and service. Dr. Grassles creativity and vision led to establishment of the worlds first undersea observatory. commonly known as LEO15. This achievement enabled development of the Nations Integrated Ocean Observing System that now supports critical national missions associated with saving lives at sea. enhancing homeland security. and forecasting effects of natural disasters. Dr. Grassle is known for his innovative thinking and many scientific achievements. which are highlighted by his pioneering work on the biology of hydrothermal vents. biodiversity. and effects of waste disposal in deep sea systems. He devoted his time and effort to ensure that the results of science were transferred in a timely manner to environmental managers and policymakers. His work on waste disposal culminated into a national policy change based on his scientific findings and testimony before Congress. Serving the state of New Jersey. Dr. Grassle advanced novel approaches for disposal and management of contaminated sediments that helped to preserve the regions port industry and coastalbased economy. He also fostered new approaches to science education that have enriched the critical thinking skills of youth in New Jersey and throughout the Nation. Madam Speaker. I sincerely hope that my colleagues will join me in celebrating the service of Dr. J. Frederick Grassle. a man whose deep commitment to excellence in marine and coastal research. education for all ages. and services to resource managers have enabled New Jersey to be a national and international leader in these fields.,,,,,,,,,,E,2008-07-08,627,Mr. PALLONE,Unknown,PALLONE,Unknown,M,35128,35176,07082008.txt,1965,300,110,2008,rise frederick grassl institut marin coastal scienc rutger univers new grassl institut grassl direct institut gain nation intern reput excel marin coastal research grassl creativ vision led establish world first undersea observatori commonli known leo achiev develop nation integr ocean observ nation mission associ sea enhanc homeland forecast effect natur disast grassl known scientif achiev highlight pioneer work biolog hydrotherm vent biodivers effect dispos deep sea effort ensur result scienc environment policymak work dispos culmin nation polici scientif find new grassl advanc novel approach dispos contamin sediment help preserv region port industri coastalbas economi also foster new approach scienc enrich skill youth new nation sincer celebr frederick grassl whose deep excel marin coastal research age new nation intern leader field,187,0.33064516129032256,0.20481927710843373
1100154096,Mr. President. 38 years ago. Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin founded Earth Day to celebrate the environment and to call attention to the major environmental issues of the time. Once again we celebrate the progress we have made to protect our environment. and are again called upon to address new challenges facing our planet. Since Earth Days conception in 1970 our Nation has worked to reduce pollution and clean up lakes. streams. and the air we breathe. These environmental accomplishments have made us healthier. our economy prosper. and have helped to make America even more beautiful. Although we have made great strides to improve and protect our environment. it is clear that we are facing one of the gravest environmental challenges of our time. Global warming from manmade greenhouse gas emissions may be the most complicated crisis our world has ever faced. We must address it quickly and boldly in the United States and assert global leadership on this most important issue. Rising temperatures threaten to devastate western landscapes. intensify drought. and magnify summer heat waves. Fortunately. if we act swiftly. we still have a narrow window of time and opportunity to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Over the next 15 years. I am confident that we can reduce emissions by at least 25 percent. We will establish a framework for capping greenhouse gas emissions without imposing economic hardship on Americans. We will also create a business environment that provides ample incentives to phase out rapidly our current outdated 19th century energy production and decisionmaking methods. Global warming is an enormous opportunity wrapped in a complex challenge. On this Earth Day. I want Nevadans and all Americans to embrace and prepare for the challenge. and recognize the tremendous opportunity we have to improve our energy security. create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and develop the new. clean. efficiency and renewable energy economy of the future. With the right investments and political will. we can soon power all our cars. homes and industry with power from the Sun. the wind. and the Earth. In a 100milesquare area of Nevada and the Southwests desert. we have enough solar energy resources to supply the entire United States with electricity. This might seem unreal today because our thinking is shaped most by those who profit from selling us fossil fuels. But. solar technologies at the utilityscale and in distributed applications are quickly becoming economical and have far far fewer of the hidden costs of coal. nuclear and other unsustainable resources. In addition. we have vast wind and geothermal resources that America has only begun to tap. By expanding and improving transmission access to rural and undeveloped areas where solar. wind and geothermal are often most plentiful. our renewable energy resources can work in affordable harmony. improving our energy security and reliability. using costfree fuel for ever. In a speech I gave earlier this year. I established five policy goals to promote renewable energy. These principles will help launch Nevada and the nation in a new direction that chooses ingenuity over stagnation. progress over pollution. They include: consumer choiceallowing consumers to choose renewable energy to power their homes at reasonable cost. consumer empowermentallowing homeowners to receive credit for generating their own renewable electricity. making space for renewablessetting aside federal land for renewable energy production. investmentproviding incentives to utility companies to choose renewables and efficiency over fossil fuels. and electric carsbuilding a smart grid that can charge electric automobiles. Achieving these policy goals could help make our nation more sustainable. both environmentally and economically. They are some of the necessary steps we must take toward a lowcarbon economy. Climate scientists tell us that the countries of the world have approximately 1015 years to radically transform the way that energy is made and consumed because greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere are verging on dangerous interference with the global climate system. This means making tremendous reductions quickly and ensuring that our energy decisions today do not warp the future for our children and generations to come. As we celebrate Earth Day this year. I ask that you join me in thinking about the road ahead and how we will overcome this great environmental challenge that we face as Nevadans.

1110025680,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Thank you. Chairman RAHALL. for championing this legislation. I support the FLAME Act because its critical to protecting the public safety of New Mexicos First Congressional District. The forest fire season has begun earlier than ever in various areas of the Cibola National Forest in my congressional district. and specifically in the Mountainair Ranger District. where last year we saw the Trigo fire burn 14.000 acres over a period of a month. As you can imagine. being prepared for this years fire season is a top priority for us. The focus of this legislation is clearly the creation of a Catastrophic Wildfire Fund. But the bill also calls for a cohesive wildland fire management strategy. The amendment that Im offering simply ensures that this strategy includes an assessment of the impacts of climate change on the frequency and severity of wildland fires. Such an assessment is critical to our understanding of how the dynamics of fire seasons are dramatically affected due to changes in weather and temperature. Our forests are already experiencing climate change as we speak. I can see the effect on the forest when I hike through the Sandia Wilderness in my district. One of the primary consequences of these changes is the substantial increase in the forests vulnerability to fire. To put it simply. snow pack in our mountains is melting earlier in the season and at a much faster rate. resulting in dryer conditions earlier in the fire season on. This requires land managers to be prepared for fires much earlier than they have before. placing even more demands on the firefighters who make up our first line of defense. In addition. warmer temperatures earlier in the year have allowed for more generations of insects like bark beetles to reproduce each summer. Weve had serious bark beetle outbreaks in our Pinon and Ponderosa forestsand the damage that they do to trees contributes to significant deadwood on the forest floor. creating even more fuel for wildland fires. Firefighters tell us that the conditions resulting from the bark beetles impact create a different kind of fireone that is more intense. more persistent. and more resistant to the tools that they have used to against them in the past. This is why we must understand these trends resulting from our changing climate and the impact that they have on forest fire behavior. Moreover.. forest fires have a compounding effect on climate change. Catastrophic forest fires release more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than the carbon cycle can naturally process. which exacerbates the warming cycle  and makes forests more vulnerable to fire.

1100188596,I thank the Senator from Tennessee. It absolutely is essential. The Senator and I share a common border between the States of Georgia and Tennessee. and along that border. Tennessee Valley operates. They are a big producer of efficient. inexpensive. reliable electric energy produced by nuclear power. In the United States of America today. 19 percent of our electricity is generated by nuclear. 81 percent by coal. gas. and a sliver by hydro. That 19 percent that is nuclear does two things: No. 1. it is reliable. and No. 2. it emits zero carbon. Carbon reduction is in the best interests of our climate. It is also in the best interests geopolitically of the United States of America. by reducing our dependence on foreign imported oil. I have offered an amendment to this bill. which has been filed. which is a new nuclear title. which reenergizes the nuclear energy business in the United States. which has basically been dormant since the mid1970s while other countries around the world have embraced nuclear energy as the solution to their fossil fuel problem in terms of energy production and electric production. Look at the nation of France. Eightyseven percent of their electricity is generated by nuclear. They have developed a reprocessing MOX facility that reduces their waste by 90 percent. So they have almost eliminated the waste problem. and they almost have total reliability on nuclear energy. There is no silver bullet in this challenge of reducing gas prices and reducing our dependence on foreign oil. but there are a lot of bullets we have in our arsenal if we are only willing to put them in the chamber. Nuclear is one of them. One of the great things Senator ALEXANDER advocated so much is the plugin car that we know is coming. You can plug it in at night. recharge it. and the next day drive it and use it. At night. we are generating a lot of electric power that goes to waste because everybody is asleep and activity is slow. If you plug your car in at night. you are making good. efficient use of the electricity you are generating and wasting. and you are reducing totally. because you use electricity. dependence on oil. I say to the distinguished Senator from Tennessee. nuclear energy is a piece of the puzzleand this is a puzzle. I happen to know the answer to the puzzle. It is all the resources the United States has at its disposal to reduce its importing of foreign oil. increase our conservation. and incentivize production of the energy we know we have within our own capacity and within our own boundaries.

1100154573,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of House Resolution 1112. recognizing 2008 as the International Year of the Reef. For almost 15 years. the United States has been an active participant in the protection of coral reefs around the world. In 1994. the U.S. was one of thefounding governments of the International Coral Reef Initiative. ICRI. ICRI is a partnership among governments. international organizations. and nongovernmental organizations that strive to preserve coral reefs and related ecosystems. This year. the U.S. and Mexico share responsibilities for the joint secretariat of the ICRI. The first International Year of the Reef was designated by ICRI in 1997. and this campaign proved to be very successful. Over 225 organizations in more than 50 countries participated and helped raise awareness of the importance of coral reef conservation and catalyzed international conversations and national level policy initiatives. This was certainly true in the U.S.A. when in 1998 an executive order established the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force that led to coordination and the strengthening of U.S. Government actions to preserve and protect coral reef ecosystems. In 2000. this task force developed the National Action Plan to Conserve Coral Reefs. a comprehensive strategy to conserve those coral reefs. An example of the commitment of the U.S. Government to such coral reef conservation efforts included the establishment in 2006 of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument. President Bush set aside almost 140.000 square miles to receive the most extensive maritime environmental protection permitted under U.S. law. This national monument. which is. by the way. the largest in the U.S.. includes a substantial number of coral reefs and related ecosystems. The goals of the 2008 International Year of the Reef campaign include strengthening awareness about the ecology. economic and cultural value of coral reefs. improving understanding of critical threat to reefs and generating both innovative and practical solutions to reduce such threats. and action to develop and implement effective management strategies for conservation and sustainable use of coral reefs. These worthwhile objectives will ensure the continued awareness of the American people in the environments that are not only beautiful. but provide substantial economic benefits. The Natiohal Oceanic -and Atmospheric Administration will lead the U.S. effort on this campaign. and I applaud NOAAs -hard work in preserving coral reefs for the enjoyment of future generations. Their dedication does not go unnoticed in this Chamber. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 1112. And with that.

I rise in support of three bills I have introduced today that will provide a comprehensive regulatory framework for all genetically engineered plants. animals. bacteria. and other organisms. The bills will protect our food. environment. and health. They are a common sense precaution to ensure genetically engineered foods do no harm. Genetic engineering is having a serious impact on the food we eat. on the environment. and on farmers. To ensure we can maximize benefits and minimize hazards. Congress must provide a comprehensive regulatory framework for all genetically engineered products. Current laws. such as our food safety and environmental laws were not written with this technology in mind.

1100177886,Mr. Speaker. the American people are looking for real energy solutions that will bring down prices at the pump. Unfortunately. all they are getting from Washington Republicans are more of the same old policies that are actually responsible for the high gas prices in the first time. The Republican solution is to open up more of our pristine land and our ocean to oil drilling. They neglect to say that Big Oil already has leases for 68 million acres that. for whatever reason. Big Oil refuses to explore. Experts estimate that these 68 million acres of leased land could produce about 4.8 million barrels of oil which would nearly double our Nations total production. Why should we give Big Oil access to more of our land and water when they refuse to drill on 68 million acres they already have? And if drilling is indeed the answer to high gas prices. as my Republican friends always claim. why arent they demanding that Big Oil start drilling on these lands?

1100183918,If its allowed. could I give a factual presentation of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve? We have a little over 700 million barrels in the reserve. I think the average acquisition price is less than $30 a barrel. They have the capacity to produce up to 6 million barrels a day at maximum production from the reserve. That then leaves at least 2 weeks to gear up to do that. World markets today are about 85 million barrels of supply and about 84 million barrels per day of demand. To really impact the price by releasing oil from the Strategic Oil Reserve. most experts think you would have to release at least 2 million barrels per day. And at that rate. you could release it for a year approximately. and then you wouldnt have any oil. So again. it is worthy of a hearing. But I would be very careful about changing the law to allow the SPR to be used for price alleviation. It was a bipartisan agreement in the 1970s. It requires a Presidential directive of a national emergency because of supply interruption that is of severe harm to the American economy. That is the standard for release from the SPR today. So to have a real price impact. given that the world market in oil is fungible. you would probably have to release about 2 million barrels a day. And if you did that for the entire amount of oil. you would have not quite a years supply.,110118540.0,BARTON,JOE,H,TX,M,R,6.0,voting,H,2008-07-14,578,Mr. BARTON of Texas,Unknown,BARTON,Texas,M,30994,31042,07142008.txt,1348,250,110,2008,allow could give factual strateg petroleum reserv million barrel reserv averag acquisit price barrel capac produc million barrel day maximum product reserv least gear world market million barrel suppli million barrel per day realli impact price releas strateg reserv expert releas least million barrel per day rate could releas approxim wouldnt worthi hear care allow spr price allevi bipartisan direct nation emerg suppli interrupt harm economi standard releas spr real price impact given world market fungibl releas million barrel day entir amount quit suppli,114,0.2898550724637681,0.20408163265306123

Senator INOUYE. in particular. has aggressively advocated for improved stewardship of our oceans and this package reflects his careful work as chairman of the Commerce Committee which has jurisdiction over our Nations oceans. As the incoming chair of the Commerce Committee. I will continue to work closely with my dear friend and mentor Senator INOUYE on these issues. And I look forward to collaborating closely with him on oceans policy and other areas in the committees jurisdiction that are particularly critical to the Hawaiian Islands. Our colleagues should know that the ocean and coastal bills included in the Consolidated Natural Resources Act enjoy broad bipartisan and national support because they are sorely needed and important to our Nations environmental and economic future. The Federal Government owns nearly 653 million acres of land in the United States. As the owner of these lands. the Federal Government has a responsibility to protect this land for current and future generations. Likewise. and as importantly. the Federal Government has an equal responsibility to protect and manage our Nations marine and coastal resources. The oceans cover over twothirds of our planet. yet we know little about what lies beneath or how the changing climate is affecting"" marine resources. The United States Exclusive Economic Zone. covers 3.4 million square miles of the Earths surface. an area greater than the whole United States. Unfortunately. our efforts to sustainably manage and conserve these submerged lands and living resources are hampered by our limited scientific research and understanding of our. Exclusive Economic Zone. That is irresponsible and must change. The five ocean bills included in this legislation will authorize programs necessary to increase our Nations understanding about ocean and coastal areas. which in turn will enable us to make the best possible decisions about how to manage. preserve. and protect our oceans and their living marine resources for current and future generations The Ocean and Coastal Exploration and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Act is critical to our ability to gather observations and data from areas in the ocean that have never been explored. The legislation would establish a national ocean exploration program within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. which would conduct interdisciplinary ocean exploration voyages to explore and survey little known areas of the marine environment and inventory. observe. and assess living and nonliving marine resources. In addition. this legislation would establish a coordinated national undersea research program. which would increase scientific knowledge for the management. use. and preservation of oceanic. coastal. and Great Lakes resources through undersea research. exploration. education. and technology development. These activities are vital given that approximately 95 percent of the ocean floor remains unexplored. Increasing our knowledge of our oceans through exploration and undersea research provides unprecedented opportunities to discover new sources of minerals. drugs. habitats. species. artifacts. and shipwrecks. Expeditions could provide images of ancient human artifacts. rare or previously undiscovered species. and exciting new ecosystems. The Ocean and Coastal Mapping Act would direct the Federal Government to integrate Federal and coastal mapping activities throughout the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. Approximately 90 percent of our Nations maritime territory remains unmapped by modern technology. Improving our mapping activities. the promotion of the development and dissemination of new technologies. and the coordination of efforts across the 10 federal agencies currently involved in marine mapping are essential. Better mapping of these waters will help to minimize maritime accidents. support .the national security missions of the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard. and improve our knowledge of ocean and coastal ecosystems. The Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation System- Act would establish a national integrated ocean. coastal. and Great Lakes observing system that would collect. compile. and make available data to support marine commerce. navigation safety. weather. climate and marine forecasting. energy siting and production. ecosystembased resource management. and public safety. This legislation represents an acknowledgement of our need as a country to improve our ability to measure. track. explain. and predict events related to weather and climate change. It represents a consensus that our understanding of natural climate variability and interactions between ocean and atmospheric environments needs strengthening and improvement. Information generated by the Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation System would assist in providing advanced warning of hazardous coastal and ocean conditions to State managers and potentially affected communities and could help coastal communities prepare for and minimize losses for a range of potentially harmful ocean conditions. Additionally. this Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation System has the potential to provide economic and ecological benefits for other coastal and ocean activities. For example. fisheries scientists and managers could use the data to predict biological productivity which would facilitate ecosystembased management. Fishermen and mariners could better predict sea conditions for safe navigation and transport. Ocean scientists and regulators could better understand. predict. and rapidly respond to the distribution and impacts of marine pollution. harmful algal blooms. or other hazardous conditions. Educators and students could learn more about basic functions and processes of the marine environment. Increasing carbon dioxide absorption in our oceans is acidifying waters and could be threatening the foundation of the oceans food web. The Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act highlights the need for action to be taken to understand and confront climate change and its impacts on our oceans by authorizing a coordinated Federal research program on ocean acidification. Over the past 200 years. human activities have resulted in dramatic increases in greenhouse gases that are altering the Earths climate. The oceans mitigate the effects of global warming by absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide. which is changing ocean carbon chemistry and causing the oceans to become more acidic. There is significant concern among the scientific community. resource managers. and policymakers that ocean acidification could adversely impact our Nations marine ecosystems. the food webs of many fish and marine mammals. and the economies of many coastal States that rely upon the seafood industry and coastal and ocean tourism. The Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring .Act would establish an interagency committee. chaired by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. to develop and provide Congress with a strategic research plan on ocean acidification. Additionally. it vests the authority within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to establish an ocean acidification program. within the agency to conduct research and longterm monitoring. education and outreach. and development of adaptation strategies and techniques for conserving marine ecosystems. The Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program Act would authorize the Secretary of Commerce. through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. to make grants to coastal States for the purposes of protecting important coastal and estuarine areas that have significant conservation. recreation. ecological. historical. or aesthetic values. or that are threatened by conversion from their natural. undeveloped. or recreational state to other uses. and it provides grants for lands to be managed or restored to effectively conserve. improve. or restore ecological function. Estuaries. wetlands. and the watersheds that flow into them support fisheries and wildlife and substantially contribute to coastal economies. The pressures of urbanization and pollution in coastal areas threaten to impair watersheds. undermine natural protections from coastal storms. impact wildlife habitat. and cause irreparable damage to coastal ecology. As our population grows. more and more people are moving to our coasts to enjoy their beauty and recreational opportunities. Coastal land protection partnership programs can help our Nation meet a number of diverse priorities such as promoting recreation. increasing wildlife. improving or conserving ecological quality and diversity. and preserving historical or cultural resources. The legislation would foster partnership programs among the Federal Government. State agencies. local governments. private landowners. and nonprofits to effectively conserve and manage coastal lands. Over 50 percent of our population lives along our coasts and our coastal economies generate onehalf of our Nations gross domestic product. The planets oceans producc an .lntold amount of wealth. both economic and ecological. for our Nation. What is good for the health of or coastal communities and oceans is good for the Nation. Given the rei-..:t- our citizens have on our marine and coastal resources and t]le large gaps exist in our knowledge regarding U.S. ocean and coastal areas. strengthening and improving our marine. coastal. and scientific programs will enable us to make the best possible decisions about how to manage. preserve and protect our

1110056249,"Madam Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 2454. the ""American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009"". This bill seeks to promote clean energy use and reduce carbon emissions in the United States. The legislation will create millions of new clean energy jobs. enhance Americas energy independence. and protect the environment. Additionally. this bill recognizes the important role that transportation plays in addressing global climate change. and I am pleased that the Committee on Energy and Cbmmerce has worked in concert with the Committee on Transportation -and Infrastructure in crafting key provisions of this bill. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). neariy 30 percent of the total greenhouse gas emissions produced by the United States comes from the transportation sector. second only to electricity generation. The U.S.. Department of Energy (DOE) reportsthat the carbon dioxide emissions from the transportation sector grew 25.4 percent between 1990 and 2006. an average of 1.4 percent each year. The most recent DOE data show that transportation produces more metric tons of energyrelated carbon dioxide than the residential and commercial sectors. and almost as much as the industrial sector. Nearly all of these transportationrelated emissions come from the use of petroleum products. The transportation sector accounts. for 68 percent of the total U.S. petroleum consumption. Americans used almost 14 million barrels of oil each day for transportation purposes in 2006. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). the amount of miles Americans drive each. year has grown three times faster than the U.S. population. and almost twice as fast as vehicle registrations. Private vehicles are now the largest contributor to household ""carbon footprints""accounting for 55 percent of carbon emissions from U.S. households. Federal policies over the last 50.years. however. have done little to address the growing problem of greenhouse gas emissions. A February 2008 report by ICF International released by the American Public Transportation Association found that a person who switches a20mile round trip commute alone from car to existing public transportation. can reduce his or her annual carbon dioxide emissions by 4.800 pounds per year. This dramatic energy savings .is equal to a 10 percent reduction in all greenhouse gas emissions produced by a typical twoadult. twocar household. Furthermore. if Americans used public transit at the same rate as Europeansfor roughly 10 percent of their daily travel needs- -the United States could reduce its dependence on imported oil by -more than 40 percent. nearly equal to the 550 million barrels of crude oil that we import from Saudi Arabia each year. To reduce Americas carbon footprint and to encourage the development and expansion of sustainable transportation options. the American Clean Energy and Security Act will implement a number of initiatives to significantly reduce transportationrelated greenhouse gas emissions. These provisions represent the next steps to mitigate the negative .impact the transportation sector has on climate protection. while increasing the livability of our communities nationwide. Under the American Clean Energy and Security Act. States will receive allowances for clean energy and energy efficiency investments. and are authorized to use up to 10 percent of these allowances for certain transportation projects. States may use allowances to fulfill the local matching requirement to receive- Federal funds for projects like public transportation system improvements. clean fuel buses. or construction of bicycle facilities. While this provision offers only a small portion of the funds needed to address surface transportationrelated greenhouse gas emissions. it is a very good first step. Additional provisions of the legislation expand the scope of current surface transportation planning to include emissions reduction requirements administered by the Department of Transportation (DOT). The Act requires EPA. in consultation with DOT. to set national emission reduction goals. bu"" requires DOT to set transportationrelated emissions reduction performance measures for each State and large metropolitan areas. States and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) must meet individualized transportationrelated emissions reductions targets. and the Act requires public notice of those targets. including an assessment of how well States and MPOs are meeting emission reduction goals. These important transportation planning provisions are also included in the Surface Transportation Authorization Act of 2009. legislation that the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit passed unanimously this week by voice vote. and which I plan to bring before the full Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the House soon after the fourth of July recess. These transformational changes to our surface transportation planning requirements. especially when coupled with dedicated funding for clean energy transportation projects.. will save fuel. reduce emissions. and advance Americas longsought goal of energy independence. In addition to these important transportation provisions. I am very pleased that agreement has been reached to clarify the definition of renewable biomass. I want to commend the leadership of my Minnesota colleague. COLLIN PETERSON. Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture. for his superb advocacy for rural America and the wood product industry. The new biomass definition and provisions that provide credit for forestry and wood products for carbon sequestration are essential to ensure that our vital wood product sector is not disadvantaged in the climate change legislation. I am also very pleased that additional language has been added to ensure that the iron ore sector will receive emission allowances. and I greatly appreciate Chairman WAXMANS willingness to work with my colleague BART STUPAK and me on this important iron ore mining clarification. While I am prepared to support this legislation .today. I continue to have concerns with the climate change bill regarding the. border adjustment mechanism. It is imperative that the final climate change legislation contain strong safeguards to ensure that our manufacturing sector is not disadvantaged by imports from nations that have not implemented carbon reduction technologies. Without further improvements. it is likely that the steel. wood product. and other energyintensive sectors of our economy would face unfair competition from nations with insufficient environmental safeguards. I am encouraged by the important contributions that my colleagues MIKE DOYLE. JAY INSLEE. CHARLIE RANGEL. and SANDY LEVIN have made in this area. and 1 will continue to work with my colleagues to make additional improvements. We must also ensure that the final climate change bill addresses regional concerns regarding the allocation of emissions allowances to utilities in the Midwest. While I am pleased that improvements were made to assist rural electrical cooperatives. I remain concerned that the current formula. which would allocate emissions allowances to utilities based on a combination of sales and emissions. would unfairly impact Midwestern power producers. and I am hopeful that further refinements can be made to ensure regional equity. For these reasons and more. I support H.R. 2454. the ""American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009"". and urge my colleagues to do the same.",111115920.0,OBERSTAR,JAMES,H,MN,M,D,8.0,voting,H,2009-06-26,615,Mr. OBERSTAR,Unknown,OBERSTAR,Unknown,M,59830,60008,06262009.txt,7514,1112,111,2009,rise hr clean energi seek promot clean energi carbon emiss million new clean energi job enhanc america energi independ environ recogn import role play global climat pleas energi cbmmerc work concert infrastructur craft key provis us environment epa neariy percent total greenhous emiss produc come sector electr gener us depart energi doe reportsthat carbon dioxid emiss sector percent averag percent doe data show produc metric ton energyrel carbon dioxid residenti commerci sector almost industri sector nearli transportationrel emiss come petroleum product sector percent total us petroleum consumpt almost million barrel day purpos highway fhwa amount mile drive grown three faster us popul almost twice fast vehicl registr vehicl largest contributor household carbon footprintsaccount percent carbon emiss us household polici last done grow problem greenhous emiss report icf intern releas associ found switch amil round trip commut alon car exist annual carbon dioxid emiss pound per dramat energi equal percent greenhous emiss produc typic twoadult twocar household furthermor transit rate europeansfor roughli percent daili travel need could depend import percent nearli equal million barrel crude import saudi arabia america carbon footprint encourag develop expans clean energi implement significantli transportationrel greenhous emiss provis repres next mitig neg impact sector climat increas livabl commun nationwid clean energi allow clean energi energi effici invest author percent allow certain project allow fulfil local match fund project like improv clean fuel buse construct bicycl facil provis small portion fund need surfac transportationrel greenhous emiss good first provis expand scope current surfac plan includ emiss depart dot epa consult dot nation emiss goal bu dot transportationrel emiss perform measur larg metropolitan area metropolitan plan mpo meet individu transportationrel emiss target target includ assess well mpo meet emiss goal import plan provis also includ surfac author subcommitte highway transit plan bring full infrastructur soon transform surfac plan especi dedic fund clean energi project fuel emiss advanc america longsought goal energi independ import provis pleas reach clarifi renew biomass want commend peterson agricultur superb advocaci america wood product industri new biomass provis provid credit forestri wood product carbon sequestr ensur vital wood product sector disadvantag climat also pleas languag ensur iron ore sector emiss allow greatli waxman willing work bart stupak import iron ore mine clarif prepar continu concern climat regard border adjust mechan imper final climat contain strong safeguard ensur manufactur sector disadvantag import nation implement carbon technolog without improv like steel wood product energyintens sector economi face competit nation insuffici environment safeguard encourag import contribut mike doyl jay insle charli rangel sandi area continu work make improv also ensur final climat region concern regard emiss allow midwest pleas improv assist electr concern current formula emiss allow combin emiss unfairli impact midwestern produc refin ensur region equiti hr clean energi,674,0.2630057803468208,0.20392156862745098
1110039410,Mr. President. I am pleased to have been able to introduce the Department of Energy Carbon Capture and Sequestration Program Amendments Act of 2009. S. 1013. along with Sens. BARASSO. DORGAN. TESTER. UDALL. BAYH. LANDRIEU. CASEY. and VOINOVIC. It Is critical that we work towards reducing our greenhouse gas footprint while producing safe and secure. clean energy here in America. I believe this bill will go far to incentivize early project developers to start reducing their carbon dioxide emissions through carbon capture and geologic sequestration. This bipartisan bill establishes a national indemnity program through the Department of Energy for up to 10 corpmercialscale carbon capture .and sequestration projects. There is a clear need for liability treatments and adequate project financing for early mover prQjects. An indemnity program is a strong step to building confidence for project developers and demonstrates that the projects will be conducted safely while addressing the growing concerns of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from industrial facilities. such as coal and natural gas fired utilities. cement plants. refineries and other carbon intensive industrial processes. In addition. the legislation maps out a clear framework for closing down a geological storage site. It is essential to consider the issue of safe. ongterm storage of carbon dioxide and take the steps needed for site stewardship during the injection phase. directly following closure and for longterm preventative maintenance of the geologic storage site. Many stakeholders associate maintenance issues with liability concerns. however they should be viewed as two separate entities. Maintenance is essential for reducing risk and limiting liabilities at a storage. site. and it is critical to have robust monitoring and verification of an injected carbon dioxide plume at each of the stbrage sites that would continue well past site closure. With a proper site maintenance program developed for each project. risk will be minimized and developers will have greater confidence that liabilities will not be incurred. This legislation will require sciencebased monitoring and verification of the injected carbon dioxide plume throughout the life of the project. to well beyond the closure phase. Also. as carbon capture and sequestration projects grow in both scale and number. there will be an increasing need to train qualified regulators to oversee the permitting. operation. and closure of geologic storage sites. This bill creates a grant program whose goal is to train State agencies and personnel who oversee the regulatory aspects of geologic storage of carbon dioxide. Mr. President.

1100208571,"Mr. President. I rise in support of the Small Business Energy Innovation Act. which I am introducing today to inspire Americans to invest in the technologies that will ultimately solve our energy crisis. As our country confronts the challenges of an economic crisis it is essential that the financial resources for our nations energy entrepreneurs are sustained. This legislation will provide technical assistance and make financial resources available to ensure that energy innovators have greater access to capital to develop meritorious energy ideas. One of the truly concerning aspects of the current financial situation is that loans to small businesses are becoming more difficult to obtain. One industry in particular. our clean energy sector. is working harder to find startup funds in order to help meet the challenges of greenhouse gas emissions. energy costs to consumers. and our reliance on foreign oil. At a recent speech in Atlanta. author Tom Friedman urged America to retake the lead in the world through innovation in ""ET""-Energy Technology. Friedman said the United States needs to ""invent a source of abundant. cheap. clean. reliable electrons."" He compared the ""ET"" movement to the ""IT"". Information Technology. movement of the last decade. The author called on Washington to create the environment and the incentives to allow the ET movement to prosper. As Ranking Member of the Small Business Committee. I have heard countless stories of small business success and how the Small Business Administration can facilitate the transition of a small business to a major company. Nowhere is this role more critical than in our renewable energy sector. Businesses and families are struggling with the inordinate costs of diesel. gasoline. electricity and home heating oil. Yet. we know that our country can do better. We must develop technologies that allow Americans to utilize clean energy from Americas resources. Accordingly. my legislation would create a Director of Energy Innovation in the Small Business Administration who is entrusted with coordinating energy innovation at the SBA and ""promoting energy independence."" In addition. the legislation provides grants of up to $200.000 for nonprofits to assist small businesses that are developing renewable energy systems. advanced energy efficiency systems. advanced transportation fuels. carbon capture and sequestration practices. advanced electrical  generation. efficient enduse energy technologies. production facilities for fuel efficient vehicles. and pollution control equipment. These critical initiatives require expertise that is. in many cases. difficult fora small business to find. This provision will assist small businesses in bringing products to market. The Small Business Energy Innovation Act creates in the Department of Energy a grant program of up to $250.000 for small businesses that are working to improve our energy security. When you consider the potential dividends of this investment. this critical seed money for energy innovators who are leading our energy revolution is a prudent investment. The potential rewards to our economy. our environment. and our national security are well worth this modest government expenditure. Finally. this legislation develops a small business guaranteed loan program that is modeled after the loan guarantee program that was authorized in the 2005 Energy Bill. The current loan guarantee program is fostering the development of commercial scale innovative technologies for large companies. while this legislation will develop a corresponding small business loan program. Loan guarantees will enable the Department of Energy to share some of the financial risks of projects that employ new or significantly improved energy technologies that will move our country towards energy selfsufficiency. . I hope that this legislation. coupled with the America Competes Act. which I cosponsored last year. will bring about the research and entrepreneurship that our country requires to claim the lead in producing energy efficient products. I look forward to working with Chairman BINGAMAN of the Energy Committee and Chairman KERRY of the Small Business Committee and my other colleagues to pass this legislation and create a strong commitment to the energy innovators who possess the ideas that will facilitate the end to our reliance on foreign oil.",110116501.0,SNOWE,OLYMPIA,S,ME,F,R,,voting,S,2008-10-02,455,Ms. SNOWE,Unknown,SNOWE,Unknown,F,37713,37839,10022008.txt,4381,661,110,2008,rise small energi introduc inspir invest technolog ultim energi crisi confront challeng econom crisi financi nation energi entrepreneur provid assist make financi avail ensur energi greater access capit develop energi idea truli concern aspect current financi situat loan small becom difficult industri particular clean energi sector work harder find startup fund help meet challeng greenhous emiss energi consum relianc foreign atlanta author tom friedman america retak lead world etenergi technolog friedman said need invent sourc cheap clean reliabl compar et movement inform technolog movement last decad author call environ incent allow et movement prosper rank small heard countless stori small success small facilit transit small compani role renew energi sector famili struggl inordin diesel gasolin electr home heat know better develop technolog allow clean energi america accordingli energi small entrust coordin energi sba promot energi independ provid nonprofit assist small develop renew energi advanc energi effici advanc fuel carbon captur sequestr advanc electr gener effici endus energi technolog product facil fuel effici vehicl pollut control equip expertis case difficult fora small find provis assist small bring product market small energi depart energi program small work improv energi consid potenti dividend invest seed money energi lead energi revolut prudent invest potenti reward economi environ nation well worth modest expenditur final develop small guarante loan program model loan guarante program author energi current loan guarante program foster develop commerci scale technolog larg compani develop small loan program loan guarante depart energi share financi risk project employ new significantli improv energi technolog move toward energi selfsuffici america compet last bring research entrepreneurship claim lead produc energi effici product look work energi small strong energi possess idea facilit relianc foreign,397,0.2925764192139738,0.2037037037037037

1110071567,Madam Speaker. after 23 straight months of job losses. we must do more to preserve and to create American jobs. and we must ensure a fair and a level playing field for U.S. manufacturers. The World Trade Organization recently found that Airbus has been receiving illegal subsidies that violate global rules and stifle real competition in the aerospace industry. We should not reward these illegal trade practices. As such. the Pentagon should take into account this ruling when considering bids for the next generation air refueling tanker contract. Awarding this contract to Airbus means the loss of at least 14.000 American jobs to Europe. In todays economy. we cannot afford any more job loss. We cannot continue to allow our foreign competitors an unfair economic advantage nor can we let our domestic defense manufacturing base erode as we have.

An important task to achieve this laudable objective is a comprehensive federal energy policy. one which puts all options on the table for debate and discussion. In other words. an ""all of the above"" approach. Included in this energy policy will be exciting new technologies which incorporate more efficient. cleaner and safer ways to harness energy from the sun and our natural resources. There will also be an expansion of commonsense practices to conserve our resources. One such method is recycling. Were familiar with recyclables. as more and more Americans chose to participate in local recycling programs nationwide. Recycling results in a net reduction in ten major categories of air pollutants and eight major categories of water pollutants. To put this in perspective. a national recycling rate of 30 percent reduces greenhouse gas emissions as much as removing nearly 25 million cars from the road. One vital contributor is the scrap recycling industry. In these challenging economic times. the scrap recycling industry employs more than 85.000 workers while providing highquality products at lower costs. thus strengthening our economy. Each year the scrap recycling industry keeps over 160 million tons of material out of landfills. Recycled aluminum saves our country 95 percent of the energy that would have been required to make new aluminum from ore. It also invests significant capital in hightech. environmentallydesigned manufacturing machinery that is used to sort. pack. transform. process. manufacture and ship materials to become new products. As a member of the House Recycling Caucus. I believe Congress must continue to build our partnership with the scrap recycling industry. Last years Recycling Investment Saves Energy tax credit has been well received. and I think we all agree that more can be done. On this Earth Day I would like to thank the scrap recycling industry for the dedication to strengthening our economy in earth friendly way.",,,,,,,,,,E,2009-04-22,973,Mr. TIBERI,Unknown,TIBERI,Unknown,M,47611,47664,04222009.txt,2206,352,111,2009,know earth day earth day dedic rais awar good steward envron world better inherit futur gener import task achiev laudabl comprehens energi polici discuss word approach includ energi polici excit new technolog incorpor effici cleaner safer way har energi sun natur also expans commonsens conserv method recycl familiar recycl chose particip local recycl program nationwid recycl result net categori air pollut eight categori water pollut perspect nation recycl rate percent greenhous emiss remov nearli million car road vital contributor scrap recycl industri challeng econom scrap recycl industri employ worker provid highqual product lower strengthen economi scrap recycl industri million ton landfil recycl aluminum percent energi make new aluminum ore also invest signific capit hightech environmentallydesign manufactur machineri sort pack transform manufactur ship becom new product recycl believ continu build partnership scrap recycl industri last recycl invest energi credit well agre done earth day like scrap recycl industri dedic strengthen economi earth friendli way,205,0.2847682119205298,0.2037037037037037
1110049508,Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009. I had the opportunity to visit a factory 2 weeks ago in my district. Theyre hiring 400 people to make solar panels. Theyre exporting some of those solar panels to China. When we talk about an economic recovery and getting our economy going. renewable energy is going to be one of the most important growth sectors to do that. -The American Clean Energy and Security Act will save families money. A .new study shows that the average family will save $750 a year within 10 years on their power bills monthly and almost $4.000. over 20 years. The incentives and help that this bill puts in place to help families conserve energy and reduce their energy needs in their own home will not only improve our national security by ending our reliance on foreign oil. will not only address global warming and climate change but will also mean money back in the pockets of American families. One of the most important things that we can do to recover from this recession and to grow good jobs for the middle class and for the American people is to ensure that we have continued growth in the renewable energy sector. This bill is critical. That is why hundreds of companies support this bill.,111120860.0,POLIS,JARED,H,CO,M,D,2.0,voting,H,2009-06-12,10,Mr. POLIS,Unknown,POLIS,Unknown,M,306,340,06122009.txt,1272,228,111,2009,rise clean energi visit factori ago theyr hire peopl make solar panel theyr export solar panel china talk econom recoveri get economi renew energi import growth sector clean energi famili money new show averag famili monthli almost incent help place help famili conserv energi energi need home improv nation relianc foreign global warm climat also mean money back pocket famili import grow good job class peopl ensur continu growth renew energi sector compani,118,0.35714285714285715,0.2037037037037037
1110053578,Madim Speaker. I rise today to congratulate Mr. Kevin Shafer. Executive Director of the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District (MMSD). on being named the new President of the National Association of Clean Water Agencies. NACWA. MMSD provides sewage treatment services and maintains waterdourses for 28 municipalities. including nearly all of Milwaukee County and portions of four surrounding counties. serving a population of about 1 million. * Mr. Shafer joined MMSD in 1988. as the Director of Technical Services and four years later became MMSDs Executive Director. Before joining MMSD. Mr. Shafer spent six years with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and nine years with a private engineering firnt serving as area manager of the Milwaukee office. Mr. Shafer hasformulated numerous innovative MMSD programs including the Sweetwater Trust. a broad stakeholder group to enlist regional cooperation to protect the watersheds of the fivecounty Milwaukee metropolitan area through both structural and nonstructural means. Further. under his direction. MMSD has invested in permanently protecting waterways from flooding and stormwater pollution runoff. by providing conservation easements to nearly 2.000 acres of undeveloped land. This program. called Greenseams. is a national model for green infrastructure in water pollution control. Mr. Shafers innovation for both the environment and the economy is exhibited through a project to construct a landfill gas pipeline allowingMMSD to use a renewable source of methane gas in its treatment plant operations. while saving customers an estimated $148 million over 20 years. Mr. Shafer is an active leader on behalf of municipal wastewater agencies at the national level. helping to formulate sound federal water resource policies and legislation. He has served on the Board of Directors of NACWA since 2003. participating on numerous committees including the Clean Water Funding Workgroup and the Executive Committee of the Board. He has appeared before Congress on behalf of NACWA. Mr. Shafer is an exceptional leader and a public steward of water resources. He has devoted his engineering career to the protection of these environmental resources for current and future water users. Madam Speaker. I urge my colleagues of the 111th Congress to join me in congratulating Kevin Shafer on becoming the President of NACWA. Under his leadership. I have no doubt that NACWA will continue to lead the advocacy effort for national policies to protect and preserve the Nations water resources for future generations.,,,,,,,,,,E,2009-06-23,426,Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin,Unknown,MOORE,Wisconsin,F,32475,32538,06232009.txt,2559,388,111,2009,madim rise congratul kevin shafer execut milwauke metropolitan sewerag mmsd name new nation associ clean water nacwa mmsd provid sewag treatment maintain waterdours municip includ nearli milwauke counti portion four surround counti popul million shafer mmsd four later mmsd execut mmsd shafer us armi corp engin nine engin firnt area milwauke shafer hasformul mmsd program includ sweetwat trust broad stakehold group enlist region watersh fivecounti milwauke metropolitan area structur nonstructur mean direct mmsd invest waterway flood stormwat pollut runoff provid conserv easement nearli acr undevelop land program call greenseam nation model green infrastructur water pollut control shafer environ economi exhibit project construct landfil pipelin allowingmmsd renew sourc methan treatment plant custom estim million shafer leader behalf municip wastewat nation level help formul sound water polici nacwa sinc particip includ clean water fund workgroup execut appear behalf nacwa shafer except leader steward water engin career environment current futur water user congratul kevin shafer becom nacwa doubt nacwa continu lead advocaci effort nation polici preserv nation water futur gener,240,0.2662337662337662,0.20353982300884957
1100169877,I would like to thank my colleague. Mr. DEFAZIO. for all of the work that he has done on this bill. Look. I grew up in a family where if you made a promise. you kept that promise. A deal is a deal. County payments available for 100 years are payment for the Federal Government owning 57 percent of the forested land in Oregon. If the Federal Government did not make these payments. these counties would have very little in the way of infrastructure funding. This money will cut the following services if we dont have it. and it will impact our most vulnerable citizens: Loss of sheriffs. loss of DAs. loss of economic development services and juvenile services. loss of mental health services. public health. and in general. loss of veterans services and senior services. The loss of county payments means the loss of sheriffs. In just one county. Curry County alone. three sheriffs will have to patrol an area the same size as Connecticut. which has a police force of 2.000. This bill is a 4year extension of the Secure Rural Schools. This program will not continue unless we give this an appropriation. It needs to pass to provide that critical funding for our counties. I cannot overemphasize the need for this legislation for Oregon and for the Nation to maintain its 100yearold bargain with the National Forest States. I encourage my colleagues to support its passage today.,110114870.0,HOOLEY,DARLENE,H,OR,F,D,5.0,voting,H,2008-06-04,292,Ms. HOOLEY,Unknown,HOOLEY,Unknown,F,11438,11477,06042008.txt,1379,240,110,2008,like defazio work done look famili promis kept promis deal deal counti payment avail payment own percent forest land make payment counti way infrastructur fund money cut dont impact vulner citizen loss sheriff loss da loss econom develop juvenil loss mental health health gener loss veteran loss counti payment mean loss sheriff counti curri counti alon three sheriff patrol area size polic forc extens school program continu unless give need provid fund counti overemphas need nation maintain yearold bargain nation forest encourag,122,0.3218390804597701,0.2033898305084746
1110056233,"Madam Speaker. I rise today to express my qualified support for the landmark bill before us. H.R. 2454. the American Clean Energy Security Act. Global climate change poses grave risks to our planet. our economy. and our way of life. it. therefore. cries out for bold action to reverse mankinds contribution to the problem. At the same time. taking such action offers us the tremendous opportunity to remake our energy infrastructure to become less dependent on foreign sources of energy. improve the health of our population and environment. and create highpaying jobs here in America. The sponsors of H.R. 2454 and its many champions here in the House claim that it will doall of these thingsthat it will ignite Americas leadership in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions to sustainable levels. shift o0r nations energy paradigm away from polluting sources and into clean. renewable ones. and create millions of jobs for domestic workers. I also believe this is the case. However. I fear that under this bill. progress toward these goals will come at great cost to Arperican families. particulaity in the area of western Wisconsin I represent and others like it. I am disappointed we did n6t have more time to debate the cost of the legislation and address our concerns through additional consideration of the bill in the Ways and Means Committee. H.R. 2454 will require utilities and other greenhouse gas emitters to hold an allowance for each ton of these gases they emit. In the beginning of the program. the government will give a large number of these away to regulated utilities with the requirement that the value of these free allowances be used to mitigate the cost to consumers. While some people are very comfortable with this arrangement. I am not so confident that utilities will pass on the full value of these allowances to. ratepayers. The initial years of the European Emissions Trading System demonstrated that giving valuable allowances to utilities for free encourages them to pocket the value rather :H7658 .than reducing electricity rates. Whether the bills additional layers of administration. oversight. and bureaucracy will be effective at preventing this from happening here is an experiment I would rather not impose on my constituents in western Wisconsin. I am also concerned that the ACES bill is skewed against regions like mine that are rural and heavily dependent on coal for energy. The formula it establishes for doling out the free allowances to utilities provides more to those areas that need them the leastthose that have a lot of zeroemission hydro or nuclear .powerrather than those areas like Wisconsin that need the allowances because of their higher emissions. The federal government heiRed subsidize the hydro and nuclear plants in other parts of the country. ratepayers in my district should not have to send more money their way while we seek to realize the same lowcarbon generation. Finally. the bill allocates fundsi derived from consumers and spends it on such things as international deforestation. investments in technology. and wildlife adaptation. While these are worthwhile goals that will need to be addressed in the context of combating climate change. I do not think we should do so by putting an additional financial burden on those who can least afford it. That is why I introduced H.R. 2757. the Consumer Assistance Rebate for Energy. or CARE. Act. This bill would have ensured that any money raised by the government as a result of climate change legislation would be given back to consumers directly to help them cope with any price increases for energy and consumer goods. The EPA stated in its analysis of the ACES bill that this type of approach is the least burdensome on lowincome consumers. and that it achieves greenhouse gas reductions at a lower overall cost than the ACES system of free allowances to businesses and utilities. While I wish my concerns about consumer protection had been addressed more fully in the bill before us. the legislation has changed for the better since being reported out of the Energy and Commerce Committee. and there Is enough in the bill to recommend it that I am willing to support its passage today so that it will move to the Senate where it can be improved further. The American Clean Energy Security Act will live up to its name in many ways. It will transition our energy systems away from unsustainable. polluting fossil fuels and toward clean. renewable resources such as wind. solar. biomass. and hydrogen. It will provide an unprecedented investment in the technologies and industries of tomorrow. creating more than 4.000 jobs in my Congressional District alone. and millions nationwide. America is the nation that invented solar cell technology decades ago. and the investments we make in the coming years will allow us to regain our leadership in the worid and be the center of innovation and industry that will drive the clean energy revolution. The bill also includes funding to help our natural resources. and fish and wildlife in particular. adapt to the changes in their habitat that have already begun."" Finally. the bill includes opportunities for farmers. ranchers. and foresters to be a part ofthe climate solution. which is critical for my district. where agriculture remains the largest industry. The USDA. in consultation with EPA. will establish a program where businesses and utilities can meet their greenhouse gas obligations by paying farmers who help sequester carbon. This new revenue stream will be very important in helping the agriculture sector cope with higher costs for energy. fuel. and fertilizer. Again. I wish we had had more time to deliberate on this extremely large and complex piece of legislation. I wish the bill contained more direct. more transparent ways of compensating consumers. I wish the bill treated regions equitably. But I support strong action on climate change and the creation of millions ofnew jobs. and I will vote to move this bill forward in the hope that the Senate will pass a bill that works better for more Americans.",111120040.0,KIND,RON,H,WI,M,D,3.0,voting,H,2009-06-26,599,Mr. KIND,Unknown,KIND,Unknown,M,57735,57887,06262009.txt,6097,1004,111,2009,rise express landmark us hr clean energi global climat pose grave risk planet economi way life bold revers mankind contribut problem take us tremend remak energi infrastructur becom depend foreign sourc energi improv health popul environ highpay job america hr champion claim doall thingsthat ignit america global greenhous emiss level shift nation energi paradigm away pollut sourc clean renew million job domest worker also believ case fear progress toward goal come great arperican famili particula area western repres like disappoint concern consider way mean hr greenhous emitt allow ton gase emit program give larg away valu free allow mitig consum peopl comfort arrang confid full valu allow ratepay european emiss trade demonstr give valuabl allow free encourag pocket valu rather electr rate whether layer oversight bureaucraci effect happen experi rather impos western also concern ace skew region like mine heavili depend coal energi formula establish free allow provid area need leastthos zeroemiss hydro nuclear powerrath area like need allow higher emiss heir subsid hydro nuclear plant part ratepay money way seek realiz lowcarbon gener final fundsi consum spend intern deforest invest technolog wildlif goal need context combat climat financi burden least afford introduc hr consum assist rebat energi care ensur money rais result climat given back consum directli help cope price increas energi consum good epa analysi ace approach least burdensom lowincom consum achiev greenhous lower overal ace free allow wish concern consum fulli us better sinc report energi enough recommend move improv clean energi name way transit energi away unsustain pollut fossil fuel toward clean renew wind solar biomass hydrogen provid unpreced invest technolog industri tomorrow job congression alon million nationwid america nation invent solar cell technolog decad ago invest make come allow us regain worid center industri drive clean energi revolut also includ fund help natur fish wildlif particular habitat alreadi begun final includ farmer rancher forest part climat solut agricultur largest industri usda consult epa establish program meet greenhous pay farmer help sequest carbon new stream import help agricultur sector cope higher energi fuel fertil wish deliber extrem larg complex piec wish contain direct transpar way compens consum wish treat region equit strong climat million ofnew job move work better,527,0.2674772036474164,0.2033195020746888
1100208656,Mr. Speaker. I rise today to express my reluctant support for the United StatesIndia Nuclear Cdoperation Approval and Nonproliferation Enhancement Act. I support this legislation because. on balance. I think it advances U.S. national security and other national interests. I do so reluctantly because of the risk that. it weakens our efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear material and nuclear technology. I ultimately support this measure for three major reasons: First. this agreement will create more international supervision of Indias nuclear fuel cycle than there would be without it. India and the International Atomic Energy Agency have agreed to new safeguards for Indian civilian nuclear plants. In addition. over the last 30 years India has voluntarily imposed safeguards on its nuclear program and has established an excellent record on nonproliferation. While India is not a party to the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty (NPT). it has maintained strict controls on its nuclear technology and has demonstrated that it is committed to being a responsible nuclear steward. That is one the reasons that the 45 nation Nuclear Suppliers Group granted India a waver to permit it to purchase fuel and technology. Second. India is a country with a large. wellestablished. multicultural and multireligious democracy. Building a strategic relationship with India will further our. interests in the region and send a strong signal that responsible conduct is recognized. Indias conduct stands in stark contrast to that of North Korea. which is a signatory of the NPT but has violated its responsibilities under that agreement by building and testing nuclear weapons. Third. this bill is important for how it may impact Indias growing contribution to global warming. Indias economy is growing rapidly. swelling at more than 7 percent per year. That economic growth is fed by a voracious appetite for electricity. More than half of Indias new power supplies come from coal. Displacing coal use in India with nuclear power could prevent the release of millions of tons of carbon dioxide each year into the atmosphere. Last. in recent weeks. secret correspondence between the White House and Congress has further clarified the U.S. position on many important questions about this deal. Assistant Secretary Bergner wrote Representative TOM LANTOS in January of this year and .stated in no uncertain terms that the United States will not sell sensitive nuclear technologies to India and would immediately terminate the agreement if India conducted a nuclear test. For these reasons. I will support this agreement. But I support it with the caveat that. in the event that India tests a nuclear weapon. I will actively and strongly work to terminate the agreement. f Remarks E2211,110121620.0,VAN HOLLEN,CHRIS,H,MD,M,D,8.0,voting,H,2008-10-02,540,Mr. VAN HOLLEN,VAN,HOLLEN,Unknown,M,46160,46227,10022008.txt,2781,437,110,2008,rise express reluct statesindia nuclear cdoper nonprolifer enhanc balanc advanc us nation nation interest reluctantli risk weaken effort prolifer nuclear nuclear technolog ultim measur three first intern supervis india nuclear fuel cycl without india intern atom energi agre new safeguard indian civilian nuclear plant last india voluntarili impos safeguard nuclear program establish excel nonprolifer india parti nuclear nonprolifer treati npt maintain strict control nuclear technolog demonstr respons nuclear steward nation nuclear supplier group india waver purchas fuel technolog india larg wellestablish multicultur multireligi democraci build strateg relationship india interest region strong signal respons recogn india stand stark contrast north korea signatori npt respons build nuclear weapon import impact india grow contribut global warm india economi grow rapidli swell percent per econom growth fed voraci appetit electr half india new suppli come coal displac coal india nuclear could releas million ton carbon dioxid atmospher last white clarifi us posit import deal assist bergner wrote repres tom lanto uncertain term sell sensit nuclear technolog india termin india nuclear caveat event india nuclear weapon strongli work termin,248,0.29714285714285715,0.2032520325203252
1110032790,Madam Speaker. I rise today to recognize the 39th annual Earth Day celebration. While our Nation is facing many other important and difficult challenges. I think it is incredibly important that we take this day to reflect on the status of our environment and how each of us affects it individually. Little decisions made in our own daily lives snowball into large changes that have tremendous impacta fact worth remembering. Earth .Day founder and Wisconsin Senator Gaylord Nelson is the perfect example of just how great an impact one person can have. Born in the small town of Clear Lake in northwest Wisconsin. Sen. Nelson went on to become governor of the state and then U.S. Senator. He founded Earth Day in 1970 to put pressing environmental issues on the national political map. Now. 39 years later. Earth Day is celebrated in 175 countries. helping -motivate and mobilize hundreds of millions of people to commit to better environmental practices and policies. Not all of us can have this same kind of global influence. but Earth Days message of collective action means that each of us has a role in preserving our world for future generations. one step at a time. For instance. if each of us* simply replaces one incandescent light bulb with a compact fluorescent bulb. we would prevent the annual emission of greenhouse gases equal to those of 2 million. We also would save enough electricity to shut down two dirty coal power plants. At the same time. American families would save money. as CFL bulbs use 75 percent less electricity than traditional bulbsa winwin for the environment and the consumer. In recent years we have witnessed countless other examples of individuals making decisions that help them go green. For example. Wisconsin leads the nation in anaerobic digesters. which take livestock manure and convert it into biogas that produces clean. renewable energy. Additionally. schools across our state have been able to save on their energy costs and help us meet our carbon management goals by utilizing biomass energy projects. These are just two ways people in my district and my state are doing their part. On this Earth Day. as t recognize and applaud the actions of countless people around the world. I also challenge each of us to continue our efforts. We must take additional steps to meet our shared environmental challenges and to leave this world a healthy. vibrant. and beautiful place for generations to come.

1100181434,I want to thank Chairman OBERSTAR fbr yielding and for his tremendous leadership of our Transportation Committee and getting this bill to the floor and his cosponsorship. I also want to thank Mr. LATOURETTE for his leadership. and certainly our ranking member of our overall committee. Mr. MICA. At the beginning of the 110th Congress. Mr. Speaker. Chairman OBERSTAR laid out an agenda for the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee focusing on three critical objectives: Ensuring the safety and security of transportation and infrastructure. supporting expanded investment. and combating global warming. The measure before us today. the Maritime Pollution Prevention Act of 2008. H.R. 802. represents yet another step towards the achievement of this agenda. and I applaud Chairman OBERSTAR for his focused leadership on one of the most urgent transportation issues confronting our Nation. As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation. I rise in strong support of H.R. 802. which would institute the legal changes needed to bring the United States into compliance with Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships. known as MARPOL. This legislation passed the House of Representatives on March 26. 2007. by a vote of 35948. The bill finally passed the Senate with a minor amendment at the end of last month. and that amended bill now returns to the House for our consideration.

1110055690,Thank you. Ms. MATSUI. I rise today in support of this legislation. I was pleased to join with my Southwestern colleagues DINA TITUS and MARTIN HEINRICH to offer amendments to this bill. which are now part of the managers amendment. With strong support from my colleagues and the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition. we cracked an amendment which- will significantly expand the governments use of electricity from renewable sources. such as solar energy. in a couple of ways. First. it extends the allowable period of time for which Federal agencies may sign public power agreements from 10 years to 20 years. This will allow renewable power providers to offer lower rates. making renewable power much more cost competitive. This is going to promote the installation of renewable power projects on government buildings and military installations across the country. In my district. southern Arizona both Fort Huachuca and DavisMonthan Air Force Base are looking at installing solar projects. This time expansion from 10 to 20 years. this provision is going to be a significant benefit to these projects and other projects across the country. Second. the amendment will establish a target of 20 percent renewable electricity for all government agencies by 2020. Similar to the renewable electricity standard for utilities already crafted in this legislation.- this provision simply ensures that our Federal Government is doing the same. We are creating a market for renewable power. As an enormous consumer of energy. particularly the Department of Defense. the Federal Government can have a significant positive impact by modifying its procurement process to support emerging technologies in this way.

1110059062,Mr. Chairman. I thank Chairman GORDON for those kind words. It is no secret that the global economic crisis has had an absolutely devastating impact on the automobile industry. Automobile and truck manufacturers and parts suppliers around the globe are struggling to deal with substantially decreased demand in vehicle sales. At the same time. we are in the midst of a transformation to a more energyindependent economy which will require the production of new vehicle technologies that will increase fuel efficiency and reduce harmful emissions. Development of advanced technologies for both heavy duty trucks and passenger vehicles is of vital national interest and requires a coordinated effort at the Federal level. That is why I am proud to have worked with Chairman GORDON to introduce the Advanced Vehicle Technology Act of 2009. This legislation will build upon the current research efforts of the Department of Energy and the private sector by providing an increased Federal investment in passenger and heavy duty vehicle research and development. By directing the Department of Energy to partner with industry stakeholders and agencies across the Federal Government. the bill will ensure that our investment leverages the maximum amount of talent and innovation and leads to faster development of new technologies that will help us meet our energy challenges and promote American innovation in the advanced vehicle technologies field. There is intense global competition right now to determine which countries will produce the cars and trucks of the future. There is no doubt that in the years ahead more Americans will be driving hybrids. plugin hybrids. battery electric vehicles. and cars and trucks powered by hydrogen fuel cells. The only question is whether these new technologies will be researched. developed. and manufactured here in United States. creating American jobs. or whether this technology will be built overseas. The Advanced Vehicle Technology Act will help ensure that the American automobile industry will continue to be globally competitive and that we as a Nation will not trade our dependence on foreign oil for a dependence on foreign batteries and other emerging technology. This legislation has strong support from industry. It has been endorsed by the United States Chamber of Commerce and by the National Association of Manufacturers. who understand how important it is for our Nation to maintain its competitiveness in research and development and emerging technology in order to preserve our manufacturing base. H.R. 3246 has been endorsed by the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and by individual automakers like Chrysler. General Motors. Ford. and Daimler. It is strongly supported by the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association. which is the industry trade group representing auto parts suppliers. as well as key suppliers based in my congressional district like ArvinMeritor. Magna International. Delphi and Bosch. I am also proud to report that this bill has the support of organized labor. including my good friends at the United Auto Workers. and from the environmental community as well. including such organizations as the League of Conservation Voters. the Natural Resources Defense Council. and the Sierra Club.,111120800.0,PETERS,GARY,H,MI,M,D,9.0,voting,H,2009-09-16,99,Mr. PETERS,Unknown,PETERS,Unknown,M,5323,5421,09162009.txt,3275,505,111,2009,gordon kind word global econom crisi absolut devast impact automobil industri automobil truck manufactur part supplier around globe struggl deal decreas vehicl transform energyindepend economi product new vehicl technolog increas fuel effici harm emiss develop advanc technolog heavi truck passeng vehicl vital nation interest coordin effort level proud work gordon introduc advanc vehicl technolog build current research effort depart energi sector provid increas invest passeng heavi vehicl research develop direct depart energi partner industri stakehold ensur invest leverag maximum amount talent lead faster develop new technolog help us meet energi challeng promot advanc vehicl technolog field intens global competit determin produc car truck futur doubt ahead drive hybrid plugin hybrid batteri electr vehicl car truck hydrogen fuel cell whether new technolog research develop manufactur job whether technolog built oversea advanc vehicl technolog help ensur automobil industri continu global competit nation trade depend foreign depend foreign batteri emerg technolog strong industri endors nation associ manufactur understand import nation maintain competit research develop emerg technolog preserv manufactur hr endors allianc automobil manufactur individu automak like chrysler gener motor ford daimler strongli motor equip manufactur associ industri trade group repres auto part supplier well key supplier congression like arvinmeritor magna intern delphi bosch also proud report labor includ good auto worker environment commun well includ leagu conserv voter natur defens sierra club,281,0.23333333333333334,0.2028985507246377
1100175535,Mr. Speaker. for many Americans. pulling up to the gas station is becoming a dreaded event. There have been some shortterm remedies. but with prices at $4 per gallon. any relief must be paired with a broader energy plan which unlocks American resources. Current U.S. policy unnecessarily keeps many areas off limits to exploration. restraining additional growth and supply. High fuel prices impact rural areas the hardest. Long commutes are a way of life. and crushing gas prices have hit farmers and ranchers in every aspect of their lives. Unfortunately. several special interest groups have said no to virtually H5486 Co every solution. including clean. renewable hydropower. nonemitting nuclear power. clean coal technology. wind power. and domestic exploration and development. It has been over 20 years since President Ronald Reagan called on Congress to lease ANWR. It has been over 30 years since a new refinery has come on line. Since then. America has paid the price for delay. and we are paying the price every time we pull up to the pump.,110121430.0,SMITH,ADRIAN,H,NE,M,R,3.0,voting,H,2008-06-18,265,Mr. SMITH of Nebraska,Unknown,SMITH,Nebraska,M,15990,16037,06182008.txt,1050,173,110,2008,pull station becom dread event shortterm remedi price per gallon relief broader energi plan unlock current us polici unnecessarili area limit explor restrain growth suppli high fuel price impact area hardest long commut way life crush price hit farmer rancher aspect unfortun interest group said virtual co solut includ clean renew hydropow nonemit nuclear clean coal technolog wind domest explor develop sinc ronald reagan call leas anwr sinc new refineri come sinc america price delay pay price pull pump,109,0.25,0.2028985507246377
1110040201,Mr. Chairman. Members of the House. as has been stated earlier in this debate. this is a very important piece of legislation that is geared to improve the condition of school buildings all across the country. and it does so while promoting energy efficiency through green buildings and creating jobs to help stimulate our economy. I have a managers amendment which I believe further improves the bill by providing equitable treatment of charter schools while ensuring that the school district can put all of its funds to good use. by allowing schools to give priority to projects designed to remove hazardous material like asbdstos and carcinogens. by setting aside more funds for tribal and outlying areas. and finally. allowing funds to be used for water supply and building envelopes. I think these are valuable changes. I want to thank Representatives POLIS. MATHESON. KIRKPATRICK and PINGREE for their insights and leadership on these changes. Mr. Chairman. critics of this legislation have argued that it intrudes on the traditional role and responsibility of the States. But this is not about Federal versus State and local control of school construction and repair. It is about meeting the urgent needs that will help revamp this Nations schools. improve student learning and global competitiveness. lower the costs for schools and taxpayers. and help us create jobs.

1110045523,I appreciate the comments of the gentleman from Georgia as well. I want to concur in the last part of what he did say very clearly that this is going to be a tax. its going to be a windfall for money for the government. not necessarily to go back into this issue but for the government. The Washington Post simply said that the proposals will require a wholesale transformation in the Nations economy and society. One of our former colleagues who is now in the Senate. he said. capandtrade is the most significant proposal- of our time. Friends of the Earth published way back in 2007. The concept of a climate change response must have at its heart a redistribution of wealth and resources. Alan Greenspan said capandtrade systems. or carbon taxes. are likely to be popular only until real people lose real jobs as their consequence. There is no effective way to meaningfully reduce emissions without negatively impacting a large part of our economy. Now. theres a . couple of reality checks that I want to deal with today. And Im joined by two of my good colleagues. one. the gentleman from Ohio. and also the gentleman from Louisiana. who are going to talk- about some of the problems that we presently have. and especially the gentleman from Ohio because his area is going to be hit perhaps as hard as anyone in this unfair distribution of income.. Its going to be a byproduct of this approach. With that. Mr. Speaker.

1100172119,"Mr. President. I rise today to speak about American energy independence. energy selfsufficiency. and specifically to talk about clean coal and clean coal technology. I have introduced a number of constructive amendments to the LiebermanWarner climate change legislation. But one of the most important of those was the need to address the future of clean coal technology. If this body chooses to pursue capandtrade legislation. we need to ensure that thle Senate includes provisions to bring about the energy security our Nation needs. The socalled capandtrade legislation would impose greenhouse gas emissions and mandates that are unrealistic in scope and in timing. In a time of high energy prices. in a time of housing deflation. in a time of food inflation. taxpayers cannot afford misguided policies that hamstring our economy. Our competitorsIndia and Chinaare not constraining their economies with carbon limits. Global issues deserve global responses. Blindly imposing Government regulations will force heavy burdens on utility consumers. on labor. and on American families. Last week. the record was clearly laid out that this proposal raises consumer prices through Government mandates. I believe most Americans favor policy approaches that balance Americas need for energy with environmental protection. In order to avoid substantial economic fallout. Federal funding is not only warranted to help American commerce meet this challenge. it is essential. Despite the recent pace in developing clean coal technologies. America cannot afford to simply give up on this challenge. Coal is abundant. Coal is affordable. Coal is reliable. Coal is secure as an energy source. Coal can also become a very clean fuel. As noted in the May 30 frontpage article in the New York Times. America will continue to rely heavily on coalfired electric generation for decades to come. The New York Times reporters are merely recognizing what is abundantly evident from official Government predictions. The article also aptly notes that coalfired generation holds great promise for reduced carbon dioxide emissions. Americas energy policy must not simply deliver sustainable energy. Americas energy future must incorporate a vision for a safer. cleaner. and healthier environment. Clean. coalfired electric generation must be an integral part. -The challenge before us is significant. Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from coalfired powerplants will be possible through first capturing carbon dioxide emissions and then sequestering them underground. Both will take time and both will take money. In order to achieve this challenge. the Federal Government and private industry must partner in funding research and technological innovation. Timing is critical. America needs to make a serious and substantial investment in. research and developing commercial technology. In order to achieve energy security and a clean environment. the Federal Government must demonstrate its commitment with targeted. upfront financial support. We must show leadership. not merely dictate flawed policies and hope for the best. What does this mean? If Congress mandates reduced emissions. it is incumbent upon us to also provide the policies to allow our own economy to succeed. Proven. commercially available. costeffective technologies must be developed with respect to carbon capture and sequestration. These technologies must be efficient. effective. and allow America to continue to compete globally. The amendment I have filed would direct $50 billion in revenue from emission allowances--$0 billion for the demonstration and deployment for carbon capture technologies. and $10 billion for largescale geologic carbon storage demonstration projects. This is an enormous investment. but. itis also necessary. This amendment is technology neutral. It would not rely on Government to dictate the favored type of carbon capture mechanism. Incentives would be provided by the choice of the recipient as a loan guarantee. through incremental cost sharing. or in the form of electricity production payments for each kilowatt hour produced. This amendment includes aggressive but achievable technological milestones. It also establishes a timeline for new projects over the next 7. 8. or 10 years. This amendment is reasonable. rational. aggressive. and achievable. Making this investment comes down to a choice between two things: one. Congress taking responsibility for the mandates proposed. two. regulating the economy and turning its back on ratepayers. on manufacturers. and on American families. Without investment in coal. it will mean higher heating and higher cooling bills that will continue to ripple through the economy. picking winners and losers. Last week. some Members of this Chamber insisted upon policies that would raise prices at the pump through regulation. Today. they tried to address the runup in gasoline prices by raising taxes. I will tell you that the rising prices of gasoline are hurting the people of Wyoming and the people across this countrytruckers. ranchers. commuters. and all American families. I adamantly disagree with the socalled ""solutions"" proposed by the majority. which were higher taxes and more regulation. I urge my colleagues to allow real solutions to todays energy prices. including American exploration and investment in American technology. It is time to enact a prosperous path for the future of Americas energy and Americas economy. With that.

1100182883,Mr. President. the Senate came back into session 4 days ago and we have yet to address the No. 1 issue in the country. that is. high gas prices. There were 44 Senate Republicans who introduced legislation over 2 weeks ago which would have an immediate impaot on the price at the pump. The Gas Price Reduction Act can be summed up in four simple words: Find more. use less. The Gas Price Reduction Act focuses on simple solutions which already have support from many of our friends on the other side of the aisle. Many of our colleagues. Democratic colleagues. have now acknowledged the merits of allowing States to open the Outer Continental Shelf for deep sea oil and gas exploration. Our bill was limited to only those States -that want to do that. It gives a State option for the opportunity to go onto the Outer Continental Shelf for deep sea oil and gas exploration. We all agree we can do more in encouraging the development of alternative energy sources. which is why the Gas Price Reduction Act contains incentives to develop plugin electric cars and trucks and new battery technology. In addition. we included measures to strengthen the U.S. futures markets by increasing funding and staff for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and examining foreign markets. These ideas also have support from many on the other side of the aisle. By focusing on the areas where we agree. instead of the ones where we differ. we can achieve results for the American people. I ask my good friends on the other side of the aisle .to join us in finding energy policies we can agree on. Believe me. the American people are demanding it. We can pass meaningful legislation which would develop more American energy while encouraging conservation. and we need to do that very soon.,110118361.0,MCCONNELL,MITCH,S,KY,M,R,,voting,S,2008-07-10,329,Mr. McCONNELL,Unknown,MCCONNELL,Unknown,M,17994,18044,07102008.txt,1773,309,110,2008,came back day ago issu high price introduc ago impaot price pump price sum four simpl word find price focus simpl solut alreadi side aisl acknowledg merit allow open outer continent shelf deep sea explor limit want give onto outer continent shelf deep sea explor agre encourag develop energi sourc price contain incent develop plugin electr car truck new batteri technolog includ measur strengthen us futur market increas fund commod futur trade examin foreign market idea also side aisl focus area agre instead achiev result peopl good side aisl us find energi polici agre believ peopl meaning develop energi encourag conserv need soon,164,0.34513274336283184,0.20270270270270271
1110032938,Mr. Chairman. I respect my good friend and colleague. the ranking member. and I appreciate what he mentioned in terms of the prior legislation. but I would say that was just research. What were attempting here is to be able to have demonstration projects. The EPA has done a great deal of work in this area in helping communities across the country undertake recycling and reuse projects. What were doing here is having a coordinated program in the agency rather than just a few projects here or there that would allow the EPA to do the monitoring. evaluation and documentation necessary to promote the new technologies nationwide. Reclaimed or recycled water is highly engineered for safety. Indeed. -the quality can be more predictable than some existing surface and groundwater sources. Right now. bnly about 5 to 6 percent of municipal wastewater effluent in the United States is reclaimed and beneficially used for any purpose. In addition to enhancing water supplies. these technologies can help the environment by reducing the diversion of water from sensitive ecosystems. reducing nutrient and pathogen loads from wastewater discharges to waterways and reducing pollution from storm water runoff.

1100142381,Madam Speaker. today we honor the 100th anniversary of the Valero Texas City Refinery. Over the past 100 years. Texas City. Texas. has established itself as a major center for our Nations energy production. Texas Citys history is a testament to hard work and the American Dream. in that such success has grown from the small refinery established by the Texas City Refining Company so long ago. In 1908. J.C. Black. Joined by more than 100 craftsmen. constructed a refinery consisting of just 11 stills. storage tanks. and a boiler house. In the beginning. the refinery had the capacity to process only 1.500 barrels of oil per day. Enduring a depression. technological revolutions. and the hardships all businesses experience. the Valero Texas City refinery now produces 243.000 barrels per day of ultra low sulfur gasoline and diesel. Texas City matured with this refinery. When America entered World War I and then World War II. the refinery increased production to meet the Nations petroleum demands. fueling Americas victory. During .this period the population of Texas City- tripled as men and women answered the patriotic call to serve in the Nations war efforts. Today. the proud. hard working spirit is alive and well as the Valero Texas City refinery continues to play an integral role in the economic wellbeing of southeast Texas and the United States. I am proud to honor the thousands of men and women who have been working on our behalf throughout the past 100 years. Texas Citys first refinery is indeed deserving of recognition from the United States House of Representatives upon its 100th anniversary.,,,,,,,,,,E,2008-03-06,674,Mr. LAMPSON,Unknown,LAMPSON,Unknown,M,35669,35708,03062008.txt,1618,267,110,2008,anniversari valero citi refineri citi establish center nation energi product citi histori testament hard work dream success grown small refineri establish citi refin compani long ago jc black craftsmen construct refineri consist storag tank boiler refineri capac barrel per day endur depress technolog revolut hardship experi valero citi refineri produc barrel per day ultra low sulfur gasolin diesel citi refineri america enter world war world war refineri increas product meet nation petroleum fuel america victori period popul citi tripl women answer patriot call nation war effort proud hard work aliv well valero citi refineri continu play integr role econom wellb southeast proud thousand women work behalf citi first refineri inde deserv recognit repres anniversari,160,0.25471698113207547,0.20253164556962025
1110055991,Mr. Speaker. I have two young children. so the environment is very important to me. but I question the benefits of this bill and strongly oppose its devastating cost. This bill wont impact the natural cycle of the Earths temperature. It will cost Texas families dearly in bigger utility bills. higher energy costs. and losing nearly 200.000 jobs. many of them in southeast Texas in our energy refining. paper. steel. and ag industries. And with China and India not likely to go along. this will have no environmental benefits at all. The protectionist trade measures added in secret at the llth hour are so rigid. they undermine our ability to reach an international agreement on carbon emissions. which is the best way to protect American jobs here. And they are written so poorly. it will be difficult to defend the measure against trade challenges by our competitors. And I should point -out. that WTO report referenced earlier today doesnt even deal with the border measures that are under consideration in this bill. Instead of rushing this 1.200page bill through Congress with no time to read it. a better solution is for both parties to get serious about increasing cleanerburning fuel.- like nuclear and natural gas. accelerating research.

We know we have to move. Inaction is not an option. Failure is not an option here given what is going to happen to our country otherwise. But I just want to mention five things. Those who are concerned about the impact on consumers. we will be recycling the money generated from this. to a large extent. back to consumers. right back into their pockets. number one. Number two. for those who are concerned about the impact on coaldominated regions. this is the only plan out there to help the coal industry survive long term by doing research to find out if we can sequester carbon dioxide and allow coal to remain a viable option for this country. Number three. those who are concerned about the impact on agriculture. we know agriculture is going to suffer if global warming continues. Take a look at the drought and the almond farmers who are losing their orchards in California right now because of the drought. And farmers are going -to be able to make money from this program in wind power. in sequestration and in advanced forms of biofuels. Number four. we will provide the American people what they deserve in market protection. We will have a regulatory program that will keep the rascals out of our till in these markets. And it will be a template of further markets. Number five. we will do for research and development what Kennedy did for space in the original Apollo project and finally get this country up to speed on generating these new technologies.

1100166427,"I rise in support of this energy and jobs bill and. in particular. want to talk about two provisions that are very important to my constituents and I think very important to the country. The first are provisions that would extend tax credits for the solar energy industry. In my district alone. there are hundreds of jobs at stake. These are hundreds of good. wellpaying. clean jobs that not only are good for the citizens in my district. but also are good for the country. We need an Apollo project like effort to wean ourselves off fossil fuels. We want the ability to be able to tell the oil producing nations of the world that they can take their oil and they can keep it. that we dont need it. We want tb be able to address global warming. We want to be able to make sure that we have a"" sound energy policy based on this Nations future. And solar energy is a big part of the solution. * So this tax credit alone. Ive had business people in my district tell me if this tax credit goes away. those jobs will go away Its as simple as that. Homeowners wont be able to meet the financial burden of putting solar power panels on their roofs. Those that produce those panels will have to lay off the people in that industry. People will become more reliant on fossil fuels. not less. Theres a second provision. very important to my constituents and also very important to .an industry thathas a positive balance of trade with every other country on earth. and that is the entertainment industry. We have tax incentives to try to keep production in this country of small and medium sized films. Were losing a lot of that production to Canada.

1100180709,Madam Speaker. today. we live in a world where security threats have become more complex. For that reason. nurturing a field of educated and knowledgeable expertstrained and prepared to meet the security challenges before usshould be a priority of the United States Govemment. To accomplish this goal. opportunities within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) should be made available for students to participate in programs that allow them to help develop the solutions to the security challenges that our Nation confronts. It is equally important that participating students come from diverse backgrounds and are truly representative of all the communities across our homeland. My legislation. the Department of Homeland Security Preparedness. Research. and Education Program Act of 2008. or the DHS PREP Act of 2008. would direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to carry out a program for fellowships and research to enhance domestic preparedness and the collective response to acts of terrorism. natural disasters and other emergencies. When natural disasters such as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated the Gulf Coast region. infrastructure and the most basic services too many take for granted were destroyed. The Department of Homeland Security is overseeing efforts to rebuild public infrastructure in the Gulf Coast region that was devastated by natural disasters. That is why. during the first year of the fellowship. participants will undertake research specifically focused on rebuilding and recovery of the Gulf Coast. It is the aim of this legislation to allow students receiving fellowships from this program to work closely with the National Center for Natural Disasters. Coastal Infrastructure. and Emergency Management to strengthen our Nations overall response to natural disasters. The research conducted by the fellowship participants will also reinforce the efforts of the Office of the Federal Coordinator for Gulf Coast Rebuilding at DHS. Additionally. the research conducted by the fellows will be shared with Congress. This important legislation will allow us to train experts and professionals to develop substantive policy solutions that will seek to solve the homeland security and disaster response challenges that confront our Nation. I ask my colleagues to support the Department of Homeland Security Preparedness. Research. and Education Program Act of 2008. or the DHS PREP Act of 2008.,,,,,,,,,,E,2008-06-26,1049,Mr. AL GREEN of Texas,AL,GREEN,Texas,M,60061,60129,06262008.txt,2431,366,110,2008,world threat becom complex nurtur field knowledg expertstrain prepar meet challeng usshould govem goal depart homeland dh avail student particip program allow help develop solut challeng nation confront equal import particip student come divers background truli repres commun homeland depart homeland prepared research program dh prep direct homeland program fellowship research enhanc domest prepared collect respons terror natur disast emerg natur disast hurrican katrina rita devast gulf coast region infrastructur basic take destroy depart homeland overse effort rebuild infrastructur gulf coast region devast natur disast first fellowship particip undertak research focus rebuild recoveri gulf coast aim allow student fellowship program work close nation center natur disast coastal infrastructur emerg strengthen nation overal respons natur disast research fellowship particip also reinforc effort coordin gulf coast rebuild dh research share import allow us train expert profession develop substant polici solut seek homeland disast respons challeng confront nation depart homeland prepared research program dh prep,207,0.3114754098360656,0.20238095238095238
1100149955,"Madam Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 1187. the Gulf of the Farallones and Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuaries Boundary Modification and Protection Act authored by my friend Representative WOOLSEY. I am proud to say that I represent the 2nd largest National Marine Sanctuary in the system. which also includes the longest stretch of coastline. I can attest to their value in pres6rvation of some of the most stunning seascapes in the world and in education of the public. The Gulf of the Farallones and the Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuaries are adjacent to the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. and they have national and international significance. These sanctuaries exceed the biological productivity of tropical rain forests and support high levels of biological diversity. The sanctuaries were established ""to maintain the natural biological communities in the national marine sanctuaries. and to protect. and. where appropriate. restore and enhance natural habitats. populations. and ecological processes."" They are the ""Naitional Parks"" of our ocean. As such. they were the first application of ecosystembased management to our oceans. This type of management is recommended by the U.S. Commissionon Ocean Policy. which we in Congress created and charged with the study of the state of the oceans and"" the management of this shared. valuable resource. The expansion of the boundaries of the Gulf of the Farrallones and the Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuaries will protect a vital part of the California Coast and the upwelling zones. which form the basis of the fisheries in the Pacific Ocean. Expanding these boundaries will also help to preserve these exceptional underwater environments. We are the stewards of our oceans and coasts. and we are failing them. The oceans belong to all the people of the United States. and we must protect them and manage them for everyones best interest.

1100203963,Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 7060. the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Tax Act of 2008. This bill provides much needed tax relief for many Americans and will help create jobs at a time when unemployment is increasing. Furthermore. this legislation provides needed incentives for renewable energy investments that will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and decrease our dependence on foreign oil. These are uncertain times for the economy. The troubles on Wall Street have created problems on Main Street. and Americas working families are struggling. In times like these. we need tax relief that everyone can count on. The legislation before us today will help achieve this goal. First. H.R. 7060 extends several important expiring tax provisions. In particular. the bill will provide property tax relief for tens of millions of Americans. support for parents through an expanded child tax credit. relief for more than 11 million families through state and local sales tax deduction. help for more than 4.5 million families to cover the cost ot education through the tuition deduction. and relief for more than 3.5 million teachers who will be reimbursed for outofpocket expenses for their classrooms. H.R. 7060 also addresses the need for more clean energy production in our country by providing long term extensions of the -renewable energy production tax credit and the solar energy and fuel cell investment tax credit. while amending them to increase accessibility. These long term extensions will give utilities and investors the predictability they need to move forward with new generation projects in the years to come. The bill also addresses energy use and carbon emissions by extending multiple energy efficient credits for homes and businesses. creating incentives for carbon capture and sequestration demonstration projects. and calling for carbon audit of the tax code to determine what policies are encouraging wasteful energy use and unnecessary carbon emissions. The bill also addresses our dependence on dirty foreign oil by extending and improving tax credits for the production of cellulosic biofuels and plugin electric vehicles. Finally. this bill is fully offset and complies with paygo rules. Under the leadership of Chairman RANGEL and Speaker PELOSI. we are demonstrating that we can provide tax relief without sending the debt on to our children. After years of fiscal recklessnessdeficit financed tax cuts for the wealthy and out of control government spendingthis bill sets a precedent of fiscally responsible tax reform. Again. Mr. Speaker. I am happy to support this sensible and fair tax bill before us today.

1110013886,Mr. Speaker. I support the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. While this legislation is not perfect. it marks a strong response to the economic challenges faced by Oregons hardworking families and it deserves support. In particular. I would like to highlight several elements Of the legislation that are important to Oregonians and to the nation. This legislation will create 3.5 million jobs and will give 95 percent of American workers an immediate tax cut. The bill also offers significant tax relief to homebuyers. manufacturers. and small businesses. The legislation provides a significant extension of unemployment benefits. provides aid to Oregon to modernize our unemployment system and expand its coverage. and helps unemployed workers maintain their healthcare coverage. This legislation puts a down payment on a muchneeded investment in roads. bridges. mass transit. energy efficient buildings. flood control. clean water projects. and other infrastructure projects. These efforts will begin rebuilding and renewing America. The legislation invests in health information technology to modernize our health care system and improve health outcomes. This investment will put people to work and will create a more efficient. effective health care system with fewer deaths. fewer complications. and lower health care costs. The economic recovery package also represents a leap forward for the nations clean energy economy. It includes about $37.5 billion in funding for energy programs. almost double the Energy Departments typical entire annual budget. and more than 10 times the amount normally spent on conservation and renewable energy. It also includes about $20 billion in tax incentives for energy efficiency and renewable programs. which I helped design as a member of the Ways and Means Committee. Oregon is known for the progress that we have made developing a new energy future and for the innovative ways that we approach healthcare. sustainability. and transportation. This legislation will buttress those endeavors. while creating jobs and easing the economic impacts on those already hard hit. So. while I retain concerns about elements of the legislation. I feel strongly that we must seize this opportunity to rescue our economy and transform it to meet the challenges of the twentyfirst century.,111118640.0,BLUMENAUER,EARL,H,OR,M,D,3.0,voting,H,2009-02-13,344,Mr. BLUMENAUER,Unknown,BLUMENAUER,Unknown,M,15068,15125,02132009.txt,2332,354,111,2009,recoveri reinvest perfect strong respons econom challeng face hardwork famili deserv particular like highlight element import oregonian nation million job give percent worker cut also signific relief homebuy manufactur small provid signific extens unemploy benefit provid aid modern unemploy expand help unemploy worker maintain healthcar payment muchneed invest road bridg mass transit energi effici build flood control clean water project infrastructur project effort rebuild renew america invest health inform technolog modern health care improv health invest peopl work effici effect health care fewer death fewer complic lower health care econom recoveri packag also repres leap nation clean energi economi includ billion fund energi program almost doubl energi depart typic entir annual amount normal conserv renew energi also includ billion incent energi effici renew program help way mean known progress develop new energi futur way approach healthcar buttress endeavor job eas econom impact alreadi hard hit concern element feel strongli seiz rescu economi transform meet challeng twentyfirst centuri,212,0.24,0.20175438596491227
1100144678,"Mr. President. the University of Maine is doing exciting work in this area. In addition and finally. our proposal would provide a tax credit for plugin hybrid vehicles. That. too. would help reduce our reliance on foreign oil. This amendment takes a balanced approach toward our tax policy. and it will help advance us toward the goal of energy independence. The CollinsLevin amendment would provide for a tax credit for production of cellulosic ethanol. While there has been a great deal of focus on using cornbased ethanol in order to decrease our reliance upon foreign oil. there are other renewable. plantbased energy sources that are more environmentally friendly and have greater potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These technologies will help move our petro-. leumbased economy toward a renewable. sustainable forest bioeconomy. In fact. researchers at the University of Maine recently teamed up with a local pulp mill to demonstrate cellulosic ethanol production at a commercial scale. It is an exciting time for this new technology. Finally. the CollinsLevin amendment would provide for a tax credit for plugin hybrid vehicles. If all new vehicles added to the U.S. fleet for 10 years TE / S1981 were plugin hybrids. an additional 80 billion gallons of gasoline could be saved each year. Obviously. we wont be replacing all new vehicles with plugin hybrids. but that statistic illustrates the large impact plugin hybrids "" can have on reducing our use of oil. The provisions in our amendment are in addition to renewable energy production and energy efficiency provisions already in section 304. Section 304 would allow for extension of the renewable electricity production tax credit. I believe it is important to give companies certainty now to Vlan investments in renewable electricity generation for the near future. These efforts represent a large upfront capital investment. Thus. companies will not continue to expand renewable energy production in the absence of this credit. which makes such projects cost competitive with traditional energy sources. Section 304 also would allow for legislation to encourage energy efficient buildings. products. and powerplants. Making buildings more energy efficient can dramatically reduce our use of oil and save money for consumers at the same time. For example. on average. weatherizing a home reduces heating bills by 31 percent and overall energy bills by $358 per year. Mr. President. as I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks. this amendment provides for the rescission of tax breaks that the oil companies themselves testified they do not need. It uses that revenue for additional renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives. I urge my colleagues to support the CollinsLevin energy independence amendment.

1100195958,Ive heard the same thing. and I believe that reference is to some of the vast oil shale reserves out in the Rocky Mountain West. But I know in terms of coal. its estimated that we have about 250 years worth of coal supply. assuming were.consuming at the current levels. What I did want to say. though. is coal is responsible for 50 percent of the electricity generated in the United States. Nuclear energy is responsible for about 20 percent. Natural gas for another 20 percent. Im up to 90 percent. Theres a little bit of other. Petroleum. hydroelectric takes a fair amount. Solar and wind I think account for about 1 percent. But unfortunately. while I strongly support solar. wind. geothermal and other renewables. I also know there are too many people in this Congress that. though renewables account for 1 percent of our source. it accounts for 100 percent of their talking points. The truth is we know were going to need coal. We need to clean it up. Clean coal technology. theres a lot of interesting. carbon capture. storage sequestration going on out there. We need to develop that technology. I think we all understand. too. that if we want to lower carbon emissions in America were going to need to expand nuclear energy. But again. many people in this building are opposed to coal technology. Theyre opposed to nuclear. Theyre opposed to drilling for gas and oil where those resources may actually be. So that really limits our options as a Nation. We have to get to work. Everybody knows it. And this is not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. This is an American issue. The American people are pragmatic. They want us to solve the problem. Ill be the first to tell you. you know. our critics. the critics of the Republican Party will say that Republicans are too focused on production and supply. Critics of the Democrats will say that theyre too focused on conservation anj efficiency. The truth is we must do both. and Ill be the first to tell you that we cant drill our way out of this problem. but drilling is most ass redly part of the solution. just as conservation is part of the solution. and neither can you conserve your way out of the problem. So we need people to be pragmatic. come down here and support something reasonable. The American Energy Act about which weve been speaking tonight is a good piece of legislation. It deals with all of the above. the alternatives. renewables. transitions to the future. as well as traditional sources of energy. conservation. efficiency. Theres another bill out there. the PetersonAbercrombie bill. which is a genuine bipartisan bill that theres a lot in there I like and theres some things Im not particularly crazy about. but I would support that bill. Im a cosponsor of it. In the name of compromise. Im willing to support legislation that will advance this discus-. sion and actually. more importantly. advance Americas energy security. At the end of the day. the American people want us to become less dependent on unstable parts of the world for fossil fuel. I think you and I agree to that. but its going to require leaders to say. yes. take an affirmative approach to energy. But as you know. too many people here are not willing to do that. and I have to lay the blame at the doorstep of the Speaker of the House.

1100166611,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 6049. the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act of 2008. As a member of the Ways & Means Committee. I am proud -to have helpecdcraft this very important tax bill that will give much needed relief to millions of American taxpayers while also moving forward on our agenda to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and stimulate our economy. Unfortunately. over the last several years we have seen tax bills pushed through Congress and signed by the President under theguise of ""relief for the middle class and the poorest in the country. I think many in. this chamber have now come to recognize that many of these measures presented at tax relief for the middle class were in fact more tax breaks for the richest in society. Today we finally have before us a bill that will give real relief to millions of taxpayers. many of whom are hardworking middle class families struggling with rising energy and food bills. First. H.R. 6049 addresses the need for more clean energy production in our country by providing longterm extensions of the renewable energy production tax credit and the solar energy and fuel cell investment tax credit. while. amending them to increase accessibility. These longterm extensions will give utilities and investors the predictability they need to move forward with new generation projects in the years to come.

The Act also addresses our dependence on dirty foreign oil by extending and improving tax credits for the production of cellulosic biofuels and plugin electric vehicles. Most exciting of all. however. are the innovative qualified energy conservation bonds this bill creates. The qualified energy conservation bonds give states and local governmedts the resources needed to invest in green programs designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Giving local authorities the power to choose what green energies to implement in their backyard is good public policy. because I know the energy needs of western Wisconsin are vastly different than those of Queens.

1110055936,"Madam Speaker. you know. this is a defining moment. And ""where were you when this legislation came on the floor"" is going to be something that youre going to remember. As the ranking member has indicated. the lobbying on this by Vice President Gore and the President and all of the people has been tremendous. and there is a possibility that they still dont have the votes. One of the reasons is there is not a fairness factor here. China adds more CO2 to the atmosphere each year than any other nation in the world. However. they have consistently said they reject any binding international cap on such emissions and claim the right to continue to increase its release of greenhouse gases while at the same time we are going to passattempt to pass this legislation. My colleagues. without equivalent efforts by China and India to limit greenhouse gas emissions. the United States stands to lose many hundreds of thousands of jobs to these countries that will profit from this bill today. The proponents of this legislation say we should make unilateral reductions. unilateral disarmament. which will in turn impose moral pressure on other countries. I find it hard to believe that China and India will reduce their economic growth and idle their people because they are willing to adopt a capandtrade. The cApandtrade is flawed. China and India are not going to go forward. Any meaningful effort to achieve longterm. sustainable reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions depend on the development and deployment of new energy technologies. we all agree. we must include clean coal technologies. carbon capture and sequestration. and advanced nuclear power generations. I had an amendment that was designed to do this. It was not allowed. The rapid development demonstration of widespread deployment of such technologies are of paramount importance in any reasonable and any effective effort to address CO2 reductions. The massive new regulatory burdens imposed by this capandtrade scheme will invariably cut the growth and innovation in this country and we will lose jobs. Lets foster new technology. Lets not pass this bill. Last night. I offered two substantive amendments to improve this flawed legislation. One of my amendments would have allowed states that have existing nuclear power plants to more easily meet the Renewable Electricity Standard by excluding all electricity generated by nuclear power from a retail electric suppliers bases amount. My other amendment would have eliminated the home Energy Star labeling program that will further reduce property values at a time when many homeowners have seen their equity and retirement savings vanish. Unfortunately. both of these amendments were struck down by the Rules Committee along with 221 other amendments. . Quoting from yesterdays Wall Street Journal editorial. Americans should know that those Members who vote for this climate bill are voting for what is likely to be the biggest tax in American history."" In fact this cap and tax scheme could cost families up to $3.100 more per year and result in real GDP losses of $9.6 trillion over the life of the bill. especially if we do it alone. China adds more C02 to the atmosphere each year than any other nation in the world. however they have consistently rejected any binding international cap on such emissions ahd claims the right to continue to increase its release of greenhouse gases. Without equivalent efforts by China and India to limit greenhouse gas emissions. the U.S. stands to lose many hundreds of thousands of jobs to these countries that will profit- from this bill. The proponents of this legislation say we should make unilateral reductions. which will in turn impose moral pressure on other countries to reduce their emissions. I find it hard to believe that other nations would follow the United States in reducing economic growth and idling millions of workers. Although cap and trade is flawed. there is much that we can do to reduce carbon emissions and our dependenceon imported energy sources. Any meaningful effort to achieve longterm. sustainable reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions will depend on the development and deployment of new energy technologies. including advanced clean coal technologies. carbon capture and sequestration and advanced nuclear power generators. The rapid development. demonstration and widespread deployment of such technologies are of paramount importance in any reasoned and effective effort to address carbon dioxide reductions.

1110032860,I want to first thank Chairman GORDON for his hard work on this important legislation and for including the text of my amendment in his managers amendment. This bill is critical to States like Nevada where drought constantly threatens the availabilities of our already limited water supply and. thus. our environment and our economy. My language in this managers amendment directs the interagency committee established in the bill to work to improve water prediction models and their applications. including analysis of variations and natural supply. watershed hydrology. human and ecological demand. and infrastructure. As We celebrate Earth Day this week. its important that we recognize that water has become and will continue to be a significant limiting resource for the Western United States. So it is vital that we fully understand the current distribution of this resource while also being able to accurately predict the impacts of future conditions like growth and climate change on its availability. Accurate prediction about the availability of water resources will help our communities as they work to ensure that businesses and families have access to clean. safe and adequate water supply. Our drinking and wastewater utilities are required to plan for a number of longterm uncertainties. In order to successfully plan and adapt to change. much more focused. applied research must be done. The Desert Research Institute in Nevada is tackling this problem headon by establishing the Nevada Water Resources. Data Modeling and Visualization Center. It will enable better understanding of the present and future distribution of water within our State. Accordingly. DRI. in collaboration with UNR and UNLV. has established an experimental facility in Boulder City to collect data regarding water interactions in desert soils. This will lead to improved predictions of the potential impact of a changing climate on groundwater recharge. The work being done at educational institutions in Nevada illustrates just how much potential there is to improve Federal coordination of predictive water modeling. Whether communities are worried about drought or flooding. snowmelt or urban runoff. the improvement of water prediction models will help communities across the country adapt to changes in the natural and the builtin environment. So thank you again. Mr. Chairman. for your hard work and for including me in this amendment.,111121960.0,TITUS,DINA,H,NV,F,D,3.0,voting,H,2009-04-23,67,Ms. TITUS,Unknown,TITUS,Unknown,F,2753,2822,04232009.txt,2432,374,111,2009,want first gordon hard work import includ like drought constantli threaten avail alreadi limit water suppli environ economi languag direct interag establish work improv water predict model applic includ analysi variat natur suppli watersh hydrolog human ecolog infrastructur celebr earth day import recogn water becom continu signific limit western vital fulli understand current distribut also accur predict impact futur condit like growth climat avail accur predict avail water help commun work ensur famili access clean safe water suppli drink wastewat plan longterm uncertainti success plan focus appli research done desert research institut tackl problem headon establish water data model visual center better understand futur distribut water accordingli dri collabor unr unlv establish experiment facil boulder citi collect data regard water interact desert soil lead improv predict potenti impact climat groundwat recharg work done institut potenti improv coordin predict water model whether commun worri drought flood snowmelt urban runoff improv water predict model help commun natur builtin environ hard work includ,216,0.2553191489361702,0.2
1100164957,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I .join in support of the resolution before us. It is appropriate and important that we honor the hardworking men and women who make our infrastructure the envy of the world. Investment in the Nations highway. bridge and transit infrastructure has not kept up with growing demands on the system. Our Department of Transportation found that to maintain highway bridge and transit networks. governments at all levels would need to invest nearly $95 billion per year for each of the next 20 years. and to improve highway. bridge and transit networks. that level of investment would need to increase to nearly $154 billion per year. Recently. the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission. a bipartisan commission made up of representatives from various transportation sectors appointed by leadership in both parties and from the executive branch. reported to the Congress that the United States needs to invest up to $340 billion annually for the next 50 years to upgrade the Nations existing transportation network to a good state of repair and to build the more advanced facilities that our people will require to remain competitive with other emerging economic powers around the world. We have neglected this work for a generation. and it will come back to haunt our children and our grandchildren. unless we begin the necessary investment and the necessary work. not just to provide the jobs. which is obviously important. but to provide the efficient undergirding of our economy. which will enable us to maintain our standard of living. improve it. and maintain our competitiveness as an international power.

1100171831,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I might consume. Mr. Speaker. as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Im pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H. Res. 127 which recognizes the 50th anniversary of the State of Alaska. and highlights its contributions to Americas economy and heritage. H. Res. 127 was introduced by our colleague. Congressman DON YOUNG of Alaska. on February 5. 2007. On April 16. 2008. H. Res. 127 was considered by and reported from the Oversight Committee by voice vote. This measure has the support and cosponsorship of over 50 Members of Congress. including all of the delegation from the State of Alaska. On October 18. 1867. the Alaskan peninsula was purchased from Russia and. in 1912. after major development during the Gold Rush era. Alaska was. granted territorial status. Enshrined as the 49th State of the Union on January 3. 1959. Alaska is commonly referred to as the last frontier. And the word Alaska. which is derived from the indigenous Aleut language. means mainland or. literally. the object towards which the action of the sea is directed. Today. Alaskas economy is strong. with the third highest gross state production out of any State of the Union. And since the issue of gas was such a major point last week for my colleagues. I should also mention that Alaska currently provides over 16 percent of the daily crude oil production in the United States. And so. Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman from Alaska for sponsoring this measure. And given the 50th anniversary of Alaska statehood. and the enormous contributions Alaska has given to our Nation. and to the world.

1100163219,Mr. Speaker. I rise today to strongly support the Food and Energy Security Act of 2007 and I congratulate the Committee on providing a bill that includes needed and critical reforms that improve access to food and nutrition. provide more equitable access to research funding and renew Americas commitment to conservation. I This bill correctly focuses on the people who need the most help. In fact. nearly threequarters of the bill will be directed to nutrition programs that will assist 38 million American families afford healthy food. It updates that Food Stamp program and increases funding for food banks. food pantries and soup kitchens. I am particulary encouraged that the bill increases agricultural research funding for Historically Black Colleges. This is important because minority institutions are usually left out when it comes to Federal research funding. As an example. I point to a Government Accountability Office study conducted in 2003 which indicated that 1890 Land Grant institutions received less than 2 percent of the competitive funding available from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This bill represents a step in the right direction. The bill also provides for mandatory funding of the 2501 Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers Outreach Program. This should help to slow the troubling trend of significant land loss by African American and other socially disadvantaged producers. Additionally. the bill significantly boosts spending for conservation programs to reduce soil erosion. enhance water supplies. improve water and air quality. increase wildlife habitat and reduce damage caused by floods and other natural disasters. Of particular interest to my home State of North Carolina. fruit and vegetable producers will have their own place in the Farm Bill for the first time. The bill includes more than $1.3 billion to support research. pest management. trade promotion and nutrition for the industry. Also of interest to North Carolina. this bill takes another important step in moving biofuels beyond focusing on corn. It reduces the current tax credit for cornbased ethanol by 6 cents per gallon and creates a new tax credit to promote the production of cellulosic biofuels. While the Farm Bill may not be perfect. the good far outweighs any shortcomings.,110118790.0,BUTTERFIELD,GEORGE,H,NC,M,D,1.0,voting,H,2008-05-14,618,Mr. BUTTERFIELD,Unknown,BUTTERFIELD,Unknown,M,33027,33090,05142008.txt,2301,359,110,2008,rise strongli food energi congratul provid includ need reform improv access food nutrit provid equit access research fund renew america conserv correctli focus peopl need help fact nearli direct nutrit program assist million famili afford healthi food updat food stamp program increas fund food bank food pantri soup kitchen particulari encourag increas agricultur research fund histor black colleg import minor institut usual left come research fund exampl point indic land institut percent competit fund avail us depart agricultur repres direct also provid fund social disadvantag farmer rancher outreach program help slow troubl trend signific land loss african social disadvantag produc significantli boost spend conserv program soil eros enhanc water suppli improv water air qualiti increas wildlif habitat damag caus flood natur disast particular interest home north fruit veget produc place farm first includ billion research pest trade promot nutrit industri also interest north take anoth import move biofuel beyond focus corn current credit cornbas ethanol cent per gallon new credit promot product cellulos biofuel farm perfect good far outweigh shortcom,220,0.2088607594936709,0.2

1100184343,from Minnesota. for their invaluable work over the years that I have been in this body on the Appalachian Regional Commission. Their full committee chairman. Mr. OBERSTAR. is strongly in support of the Appalachian Regional Commission. He has been to our State of West Virginia and seen how important it is. And this bill certainly would not only extend the work of the Appalachian Regional Commission. but it would enhance that work. Throughout my career as a Member of this body. I have supported the work of ARC. West Virginia is the only State that has its entire borders within the jurisdiction of the Appalachian Regional Commission. We have seen firsthand how it has enabled struggling communities throughout West Virginia and the Appalachian region to provide economic opportunity and a renewed sense of hope to our citizens. I would like to point out specific provisions in this bill aimed at increasing Americanmade energy for America. We have spent weeks on this floor hearing about the need to increase domestic energy supplies by becoming even more beholden to Big Oil. But we have at our fingertips the chance to help forge a better solution. We possess the technological knowhow to convert coal to environmentally advanced transportation fuels and electric power. This bill recognizes that and provides for an infusion of investment to help make that happen. A provision in this legislation. for example. would enable the ARC to make grants. provide technical assistance. enter into contracts and otherwise provide for projects that would increase the use of renewable energy. particularly biomass. in the Appalachian Region to produce alternative transportation fuels. This is extremely important in helping make a commercial coaltoliquids industry a reality in this country. The use of biomass with coal in the conversion process can sharply cut carbon emissions of coaltoliquid fuels. A study provided by Princeton University found that by combining 30 percent biomass with coal in the conversion process and apturing and sequestering the carbon dioxide. CTL fuel can be made cleaner than other conventional liquid. fuels in use today. A second provision in the bill would provide support for the development of conventional energy resources. such as coal. to provide electricity using advanced greenhouse gas reduction technologies. More plainly. it would help to advance projects which would capture and store carbon emissions. a necessity to our continued use of coal and other fossil fuels throughout the foreseeable future. In this age of increasing energy need and growing carbon awareness. it makes sense that such an initiative would find a home in Appalachia. a region in which much of the economy is intertwined with coal. The development of CTL and the success of carbon capture and storage is vital to the Nations quest for greater energy independence. CTL fuels will assure us of a readily usable. environmentally advanced alternative to current highcost transportation fuels.,110115920.0,OBERSTAR,JAMES,H,MN,M,D,8.0,voting,H,2008-07-15,356,Mr. OBERSTAR,Unknown,OBERSTAR,Unknown,M,36187,36286,07152008.txt,3006,477,110,2008,invalu work appalachian region full oberstar strongli appalachian region seen import certainli extend work appalachian region enhanc work career work arc entir border appalachian region seen firsthand struggl commun appalachian region provid econom renew sens citizen like point provis aim increas americanmad energi america floor hear need increas domest energi suppli becom even beholden big fingertip help forg better solut possess technolog knowhow convert coal environment advanc fuel electr recogn provid infus invest help make happen provis exampl arc make provid assist enter contract otherwis provid project increas renew energi particularli biomass appalachian region produc fuel extrem import help make commerci coaltoliquid industri realiti biomass coal convers sharpli cut carbon emiss coaltoliquid fuel provid princeton univers found combin percent biomass coal convers aptur sequest carbon dioxid ctl fuel cleaner convent liquid fuel provis provid develop convent energi coal provid electr advanc greenhous technolog plainli help advanc project captur store carbon emiss necess continu coal fossil fuel forese futur age increas energi need grow carbon awar make sens find home appalachia region economi intertwin coal develop ctl success carbon captur storag vital nation greater energi independ ctl fuel us readili usabl environment advanc current highcost fuel,273,0.2727272727272727,0.2

1100184832,Mr. Speaker. with nearly 300 fires continuing to burn in California. it is clear we cannot afford to wait to deal with the enduring threat forest fires pose to our communities. Thats why I rise in strong support of H.R. 5541. the Federal Land Assistance. Management. and Enhancement (FLAME) Act. Over the last decade. weve seen a dramatic increase in the number of devastating forest fires. Those fires have long lasting effects on our ecosystem. increasing the deadliness of mudslides. which destroy our homes. displace once vegetated areas with bare terrain.-and disburse large quantities of pollutants across broad regions. Nine million acres burned across the United States last year. and there is no indication that 2008 will be any different. Climate change and drought are creating longer and more intense fire seasons. while a century of fire containment has made the forests denser and more vulnerable to burning. The increase in forest fires has led to skyrocketing costs for federal fire suppression efforts. which prevents the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Department of Agricultures Forest Service Agency from adequately funding essential programs that will lessen the intensity of fires. reduce their frequency. and better protect the public. The FLAME Act would prevent future forest fires from devastating communities across the country and crippling federal land management agency budgets by creating an emergency national fund devoted solely to fighting such destructive fires. This fund will be separate from traditional funding for fire mitigation and prevention. Its our responsibility to empower our nations firefighters with the tools they need to effectively fight forest fires. I ask my colleagues to join me in passing this important legislation to better ensure that our citizens. environment. and ecosystem are safe from the dangers of forest fires.,,,,,,,,,,E,2008-07-15,845,Ms. WOOLSEY,Unknown,WOOLSEY,Unknown,F,62465,62510,07152008.txt,1892,294,110,2008,nearli fire continu burn california clear afford wait deal endur threat forest fire pose commun that rise strong hr land assist enhanc flame last decad weve seen dramat increas devast forest fire fire long last effect ecosystem increas deadli mudslid destroy home displac veget area bare terrainand disburs larg quantiti pollut broad region nine million acr burn last indic climat drought longer intens fire season centuri fire contain forest denser vulner burn increas forest fire led skyrocket fire effort us depart us depart agricultur forest fund program lessen intens fire frequenc better flame futur forest fire devast commun crippl land emerg nation fund fight destruct fire fund tradit fund fire mitig respons empow nation firefight tool need effect fight forest fire import better ensur citizen environ ecosystem safe danger forest fire,178,0.29133858267716534,0.2

The FLAME Act addresses the escalating costs of wildfires by creating a government fund for devastating emergency wildfires. My amendment addresses the growing problem that the bark beetle has on our forests. This beetle is killing millions of trees out West. and the dead and dying trees they leave in their wake create the kind of fuel that can feed major wildfires and threaten our communities. 1. My amendment directs the allocation of funding in this Act to account for forest areas. not only in Idaho. but throughout the country. that have been greatly damaged by the infestation of invasive insects.

The Presidents budget would forc6 them out of business and send their. work and their jobs overseas. But this is what the President failed to tell those listening last night. His new energy taxes would hit every single American. The new taxes in his carbon program would increase electricity prices. the price at the pump. and home heating oil costs. Republicans believe we must be good stewards of the environment. and Louisiana workers prove every day that we can produce energy in an environmentally responsible way.

I stand before you today to acknowledge the importance of the United States presence in the Caribbean during these difficult economic times and to enter into the record an editorial from the Carib News by Basil Wilson entitled ""Jamaica and the World Economy."" As the world deals with the difficult economic challenges. there needs to be a renewed economic commitment to the Caribbean nations. who are also suffering from the spiraling effect of the weakened world economy. For many years. the United States has cultivated a relationship with the Caribbean that of Remarks February 25. 2009 involved a strong history of generous remittances and a prospering reciprocal trade relationship. As a result. both the U.S. and the Caribbean have benefited. The United States must continue to uphold strong trading ties with the Caribbean islands to makecertain their Gross Domestic Product is not greatly compromised. This is also not the time to decrease our level of relief efforts in the Caribbean community. We must understand that an economic decline in the First World results in an economic catastrophe in these Caribbean areas. As the world tries to gain control of the wavering economic calamity. let us not forget that our neighbors and friends in the Western Hemisphere are also dealing with the adverse effects of the global economy.

1110018555,"Madam Speaker. today I am pleased to introduce ""CLEAN TEA."" the Clean LowEmissions Affordable New Transportation Equity Act. with my colleagues ELLEN TAUSCHER and STEVEN LATOURETT. This legislation recognizes that the United States cannot meet its climate change goals without addressing emissions from the transportation sector. Transportation is responsible for about onethird of greenhouse gas emissions. passenger automobiles and light trucks alone contribute 21 percent. The transportation sector must be responsible for a proportionate amount of the solution. Since 1980. the number of miles Americans drive has grown three times faster than the U.S. population. and almost twice as fast as vehicle registrations. Although new vehicle technology and low carbon fuel can substantially reduce emissions from automobiles and light trucks. these gains are likely to be offset by continuing growth in vehicle miles traveled. It is critical thai legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions also provides people with lowcarbon transportation options through community design and transportation alternatives. Providing consumers with transportation options will also save them money and provide additional public health. environmental. economic. and quality of life benefits. CLEAN TEA is predicated on the adoption of a comprehensive climate change bill that would generate revenue for the Federal government. Under CLEAN TEA. 10 percent of the funding generated through this legislation would be used to create a more efficient transportation system and lower greenhouse gas emissions through strategies such as funding new or expanded transit or passenger rail supporting development around transit stops. and making neighborhoods safer for bikes and pedestrians. In order to be eligible for the funding authorized by this legislation. cities and state departments of transportation would have to review their transportation plans and determine how they could reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The bill then provides federal funding for projects in those transportation plans to be distributed to states and localities based on the expected reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in each plan. States and cities with more ambitious plans would receive greater funding. As we move forward to address climate change. I hope my -colleagues will work with me to align our transportation and climate policy goals. By doing this. we can reduce our carbon footprint. improve our communities. save Americans money. and create a transportation system for the 21 st century.",,,,,,,,,,E,2009-03-05,861,Mr. BLUMENAUER,Unknown,BLUMENAUER,Unknown,M,45855,45916,03052009.txt,2567,377,111,2009,pleas introduc clean tea clean lowemiss afford new equiti ellen tauscher latourett recogn meet climat goal without emiss sector respons greenhous emiss passeng automobil light truck alon contribut percent sector respons proportion amount solut sinc mile drive grown three faster us popul almost twice fast vehicl registr although new vehicl technolog low carbon fuel emiss automobil light truck gain like offset continu growth vehicl mile travel thai greenhous emiss also provid peopl lowcarbon commun provid consum also money provid health environment econom qualiti life benefit clean tea predic comprehens climat gener clean tea percent fund gener effici lower greenhous emiss strategi fund new expand transit passeng rail develop around transit make neighborhood safer bike pedestrian fund author citi depart plan determin could greenhous emiss provid fund project plan distribut local expect greenhous emiss plan citi ambiti plan greater fund move climat work align climat polici goal carbon footprint improv commun money st centuri,238,0.304635761589404,0.2

1100187249,Madam Speaker. today we commemorate the 34th anniversary of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. Today we also honor the memory and sacrifice of the nearly 200.000 Greek Cypriots who were forcibly removed from their homes. the 5.000 Cypriots who were killed during the invasion and the nearly 1.500 Greek Cypriots who remain missing to this day. Cyprus and the U.S. share a deep and abiding commitment to upholding the ideals of freedom. human rights. and the international rule of law. As that commitment is tested. we must draw on our common values and mutual democratic vision to promote stability. prosperity and peace. The United States has a moral and ethical obligation to stand with Cypriots to reunify their island and end the military occupation. We will continue to work together with the people of Cyprus toward their goal to reunify the island as a bicommunal and bizonal federation with a single sovereignty. single international personality and single citizenship with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all Cypriots. By working together and building on our common values and interests. the people of Cyprus and the United States can achieve a united island that fulfills the promise of peace and democracy for which a generation of Cypriots have paid so dearly.,,,,,,,,,,E,2008-07-22,627,Mr. VAN HOLLEN,VAN,HOLLEN,Unknown,M,52355,52386,07222008.txt,1291,211,110,2008,commemor anniversari turkish invas cypru also sacrific nearli greek cypriot forcibl remov home cypriot kill invas nearli greek cypriot day cypru us share deep uphold ideal freedom human intern common valu mutual vision promot stabil prosper moral ethic stand cypriot reunifi island continu work togeth peopl cypru toward goal reunifi island bicommun bizon sovereignti intern citizenship respect human fundament freedom cypriot work togeth build common valu interest peopl cypru achiev island fulfil promis democraci gener cypriot dearli,114,0.3373493975903614,0.2

Senator GREGG. who is now on the floor. has introduced legislation to double funding for the Low Income Heating Assistance Program. and to do so in a way that is fully paid for. I am proud to cosponsor that legislation. and it is legislation that should also be included in this final energy package. We need an opportunity to offer amendments on renewables. on lowincome heating assistance. on production. in order to make this a meaningful energy package that makes a difference for all the people in the country by bringing down those energy costs we see every day at the pump and across the country.

1100166606,Mr. Speaker. I strongly support this legislation that will extend critical tax credits for renewable energy and for American families while not adding to the federal deficit. As cochair of the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus. I am especially pleased to see the House take action on needed tax credits for renewable energy. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) in particular has been instrumental in promoting the creation of a renewable energy industry. An extended PTC will provide more market certainty and we must have an extension of this key tax credit before the current credit expires at the end of 2008. I must add that. while I am pleased that the bill provides a 3year extension of the PTC for most renewable energy sources. I am concerned that it only provides a 1year extension for wind energy. Wind is a very promising renewable energy source and a 1year extension will not be as helpfUl for the industry. I will continue to lead the fight to extend the PTC for more than 1 year. The bill also extends the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for solar energy. qualified fuel cells. and microturbines through the end of 2014. The ITC will help companies with initial investment costs in expanding these renewable energy sources across the country. The bill also authorizes $2 billion of new clean renewable energy bonds (CREBS) for public power providers and electric cooperatives. This is a critical tool. especially for Colorados rural coops and municipal utilities. This bill would also benefit families who want to invest in renewable energy. It would extend the credit for residential solar property for 6 years and increase the annual credit cap. currently capped at $2.000. to $4.000. And it would expand the definition to. include residential small wind equipment and geothermal heat pumpsso that consumers have more options. Rising gas prices are forcing many Coloradans to dip into. their savings just to make ends meet. This bill will help families reduce their fuel bills by providing $3000 in tax credits toward the purchase of fuelefficient. plugin hybrid vehicles. It will also help address longterm fuel cost concerns by expanding production of homegrown fuels. including creating a new production tax credit for cellulosic biofuels besides ethanol. as well as an extension of the tax credits for biodiesel and renewable diesel. I supported the energy bill that the House passed last year which included many of these important tax provisions. as well as the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of 2008 that the House passed earlier this year. But. for the lack of support in the Senate. these provisions have not yet made it to the Presidents desk to be signed into law. And this bill will also help Colorado businesses stay competitive by extendingthe.research and development tax credit for 1 year. While again I would like to see this key tax credit extended for more thad 1 year. this is a step in the right direction. To help with the hard economic times that Coloradans are facing. this bill includes several other key tax credits. including expanding the child tax credit for some of our neediest families. allowing teachers to take a deduction for purchasing classroom supplies out of their own pockets. and providing additional support for families paying for college education. I hope today we can move this bill forward and promote positive change that will benefit our families and rural communities. save consumers money. reduce air pollution. and increase reliability and energy security. I strongly encourage my colleagues in the House to vote for this needed legislation. and also encourage quick action in the Senate so that we may move it to the Presidents desk.,110117470.0,UDALL,MARK,H,CO,M,D,2.0,voting,H,2008-05-21,486,Mr. UDALL of Colorado,Unknown,UDALL,Colorado,M,56769,56864,05212008.txt,3723,615,110,2008,strongli extend credit renew energi famili deficit cochair renew energi energi effici especi pleas see take need credit renew energi product credit ptc particular instrument promot renew energi industri extend ptc provid market certainti extens key credit current credit expir pleas provid extens ptc renew energi sourc concern provid extens wind energi wind promis renew energi sourc extens help industri continu lead fight extend ptc also extend invest credit itc solar energi fuel cell microturbin itc help compani invest expand renew energi sourc also author billion new clean renew energi creb provid electr tool especi coop municip also benefit famili want invest renew energi extend credit residenti solar increas annual credit cap current cap expand includ residenti small wind equip geotherm heat pumpsso consum rise price forc coloradan dip make meet help famili fuel provid credit toward purchas fueleffici plugin hybrid vehicl also help longterm fuel concern expand product homegrown fuel includ new product credit cellulos biofuel ethanol well extens credit biodiesel renew diesel energi last includ import provis well renew energi energi conserv lack provis also help competit extendingtheresearch develop credit like see key credit extend thad direct help hard econom coloradan face includ key credit includ expand child credit neediest famili allow teacher take deduct purchas classroom suppli pocket provid famili pay colleg move promot posit benefit famili commun consum money air pollut increas reliabl energi strongli encourag need also encourag quick move,357,0.3582887700534759,0.2

And yet instead of solving the problem. were extending the problem through a hoax.

1110056229,"Madam Speaker. as the chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee and someone who is very concerned about the need to safeguard wildlife and ecosystems from global warming. I wish to express my strong support for the ""American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009."" I believe that the policy provisions in this legislation. coupled with a new core funding stream for wildlife and natural resources derived from a portion of the Federal revenues from expected capandtrade legislation will provide the policy response necessary to tackle this significant challenge. I am very much aware of the need to take action to address global warming. and I have held hearings to examine the impact of climate change on many of the agencies and resources under my subcommittees jurisdiction. I have consistently stated my belief that climate change may be the emerging issue of our time. Climate change will alter the face of. our planet in ways we cannot yet fully comprehend. and I believe it is our responsibility not only to do as much as possible to halt or slow it. but also to do everything in our power to protect the earths resources from its impacts so that future generations will be able to benefit from them as we and past generations have done. Our Nations wildlife is one critically important resource that is particularly vulnerable to climate change and is also a resource that is a fundamental part of Americas history and character. Conservation of wildlife and wildlife habitat is a core value shared by all Americans. Americas wildlife is vital to our Nation for many reasons. Wildlife conservation provides economic. social. educational. recreational. emotional. and spiritual benefits. The economic value of the outdoor recreation industryhunting. fishing. and wildlife viewing. hiking. paddlingalone is estimated to contribute $730 billion annually to the U.S.- economy. Wildlife habitat. including forests. grasslands. riparian lands. wetlands. rivers and other water bodies. is an essential component of the American landscape. and is protected and valued by Federal. State. and local.gdvernments. Tribes. private landowners. and conservation organizations. Unfortunately. it is becoming increasingly apparent that the effect of climate change on wildlife will be profound. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports have made clear that global warming is occurring. that it is exacerbated byhuman activity. and that it will have devastating impacts on wildlife and wildlife habitat. In addition. a recent report. Global Climate Change in the United States. was released by the Administration and reflects the mostcurrent information from our Nation§ leading scientists who agree that the impacts from climate change are already being felt and will continue to increase. Global warming is already impacting all of us: threatening the water we drink. the air we breathe. the medicines we use. the food we eat. the forests and fisheries we depend on. the special places we take our children.

1100193887,Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of the Commodity Markets Transparency and Accountability Act of 2008 . I commend Chairman PETERSON for his hard work on this legislation. which will help curtail the rising oil prices through curbing excessive speculation in commodity futures markets. High gasoline prices are burdening American families every day. The conversation on addressing our energy challenge has focused largely around factors of supply and demand. However. the rise in the price of oil cannot be attributed to any one factor. Burgeoning world oil demand. collusive practices of OPEC nations. the weakening dollar. and possible excessive speculation in the energy futures market are all potential contributors to the problem. Though we cannot say with certainty whether speculation is driving up the price of oil. Department of Energy officials have observed that the magnitude of price increases is unlikely to result from supply and demand forces alone. They have pointed to excessive speculation as a likely contributor to inflated oil prices. In the face of this possibility. Congress should act now. without disrupting healthy market activity. to close loopholes and prevent excessive speculation from driving up prices and increasing hardship for American families. The Commodity Markets Transparency and Accountability Act enhances the regulatory capacity of the Commodity Futures.Trade Commission (CFTC). Through increased staffing. closing corporate loopholes. and setting position limits for individuals. CFTC will be better equipped to address the problem of high energy prices that are burdening American families. The Commodity Markets Transparency and Accountability Act also directs the Government Accountability Office to conduct a detailed study of speculators effects on agriculture and energy futures markets and prices. Along with acting proactively to prevent potential excessive speculation today. this bill will allow for a better understanding of what the. effects of speculation have actually been. The Commodity Markets Transparency and Accountability Act takes bold steps to curb excessive speculation that may be contributing to the hardships American families are facing today. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.,,,,,,,,,,E,2008-08-01,342,Ms. MCCOLLUM of Minnesota,Unknown,MCCOLLUM,Minnesota,F,33633,33695,08012008.txt,2262,333,110,2008,rise commod market transpar commend peterson hard work help curtail rise price curb excess specul commod futur market high gasolin price burden famili day convers energi challeng focus larg around factor suppli rise price attribut factor burgeon world collus opec nation weaken possibl excess specul energi futur market potenti contributor problem though certainti whether specul drive price depart energi observ magnitud price increas unlik result suppli forc alon point excess specul like contributor inflat price face possibl without disrupt healthi market close loophol excess specul drive price increas hardship famili commod market transpar enhanc regulatori capac commod futurestrad cftc increas staf close corpor loophol posit limit individu cftc better equip problem high energi price burden famili commod market transpar also direct detail specul effect agricultur energi futur market price along proactiv potenti excess specul allow better understand effect specul commod market transpar take bold curb excess specul contribut hardship famili face,209,0.2857142857142857,0.2

The Blue Dogs wanted to take advantage of this opportunity tonight to speak about energy policy issues. I think that there is no doubt that when it comes to domestic policy issues that this country faces. that energy policy is right at the top of the list. I think it is clear that this cohntry should be looking for a comprehensive balanced energy policy. and I think that represents the type of politics the Blue Dogs in the House of Representatives have often supported. We have a number of issues that we really want to work through tonight. and I have a number of my fellow Blue Dog colleagues who are going to join me during this hour to talk about various energy policy issues.

1100149982,"Madam Speaker. I rise today in recognition of National Public Health Week (NPHW). April 713. a week to focus on issues facing the public health and find ways to improve the health of all. This year NPHW focuses on how climate change is affecting the health of Americans and people around the world. The impact of global climate change on our planet and the role we have played in speeding its progress is becoming increasingly selfevident. The work of groups like the American Public Health Association and committed individuals. such as former Vice President A Gore. have created a heightened awareness of what is one of the most important issues of the coming century. This heightened state of public awareness has led to calls -across the country for a new emphasis on reducing the amount of greenhouse gases that are expelled into the atmosphere by finding new. cleaner sources of energy. reducing our consumption of natural resources. and using energyefficient products. In my home State of Iowa we are working hard to find new and innovative ways to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases produced. It gives me great pride to say that a recent study by the American Wind Energy Association found that Iowa ranked first in the Nation in the percentage of windgenerated electricity created in the State. and fourth in total wind electricity generation. The Iowa Climate Change Advisory Council. ICCAC. created less than a year ago in April 2007. is charged with finding ways for Iowa to combat climate change by becoming more energy efficient andindependent. The ICCAC is right now creating plans for the reduction of greenhouse gases statewide with target goals of 50 percent to 90 percent by 2050. In February of this year Governor Chet Culver signed Executive Order Six. establishing a new ""green government"" initiative. This initiative Calls for improving energy efficiency in three areas. greening new and existing State E537 CONGRESSIONAL .RECORD - ExtensiosofRemarks buildings and facilities. promoting resource efficiency by using recycled and sustainable products. and recycling used material. and increasing the use of biofuels in State automobiles and improving their fuel efficiency. Across Iowa. communities large and small are following the example set by the State government. and in many places blazing their own path. These efforts must be replicated across the country and around the world if we are to curb the emission of greenhouse gases and protect our planet for future generations.",,,,,,,,,,E,2008-04-08,290,Mr. BOSWELL,Unknown,BOSWELL,Unknown,M,16849,16918,04082008.txt,2508,405,110,2008,rise recognit nation health nphw april focu issu face health find way improv health nphw focus climat affect health peopl around world impact global climat planet role play speed progress becom increasingli selfevid work group like health associ individu gore heighten awar import issu come centuri heighten awar led call new emphasi amount greenhous gase expel atmospher find new cleaner sourc energi consumpt natur energyeffici product home work hard find new way amount greenhous gase produc give great pride wind energi associ found rank first nation percentag windgener electr total wind electr gener climat iccac ago april find way combat climat becom energi effici andindepend iccac plan greenhous gase statewid target goal percent percent chet culver execut establish new green call improv energi effici three area green new exist congression extensiosofremark build facil promot effici recycl product recycl increas biofuel automobil improv fuel effici commun larg small exampl place blaze path effort replic around world curb emiss greenhous gase planet futur gener,244,0.3037974683544304,0.2
1100149139,I thank the Senator from Nevada for yielding me some of his time. This has been a big priority on this side of the aisle. to get clean energy tax credits so we can continue to stimulate investment in wind and solar and energy efficiency. and a variety of othersfuel cells. biomass. geothermal. and the list goes on and on. This is the fourth time we have tried to get to this legislation. Three other times we have come within one vote. so we are here today with more bipartisan support for a proposed solution. My colleagues and the chairman of the Finance Committee have worked very hard on this legislation in general. on the concept of trying to push forward these tax credits. but we are at a critical point. In fact. I have said to my colleagues that Rome is burning. that is. we are at the precipice now of projects actually getting canceled. Having been in business. I know what it is like to have your first quarter earnings report and then have to show some forward advancement to your investors about your projects. That is where we are. And because we arent giving certainty in the Tax Code to these investors. they are going to start canceling projects. So we cannot wait another month. another 2 months to get about this tax. If we want to give certainty to the markets to continue to invest in alternative energy to take some of the pressure off of the rising cost of energy. now is the time to act. So I hope my colleagues will think about the bipartisan nature of the amendment. We have failed three times and have come one vote short to try to help our own economies in our States and in our country by saving this investment cycle. Give the predictability so we can keep 100.000 jobs working. so we can get renewable energy produced and invested in during 2008. and so we can have the production of CO2reducing energy supply and get that going now. I could say to my colleagues that we are almost at a point where the United States is so far behind what other countries are doing that we are not even going to be able to claim we are leading in this area if we do not get about the task.

1100149137,Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that Senators CANTWELL and THUNE be added as cosponsors to the amendment. I am sure there will be others who will want to be added as cosponsors to this amendment. Since Senator CANTWELL and I introduced the freestanding bill yesterday. we already have 28 of our colleagues who have become cosponsors. Additionally. we expect many more of our colleagues will be added as cosponsors to the bill and will also want to be added as cosponsors to this amendment. Briefly. I wish to share my time with the Senator from Washington. who has shown great leadership on this issue. The amendment we are proposing deals with renewables. We know this country has an energy problem. We are too dependent on foreign sources of energy. Too much of our energy byproducts are polluting the environment. and there are concerns about climate change around the world. And this amendment addresses both of those concerns. as well as being a stimulant to the economy. There are over 100.000 jobs that we protected with this amendment. We are talking about solar power. geothermal. wind energy and biomass. There are many different renewables that are going to help within this amendment. Additionally. at a time when our country is at war in places where we are spending over $100 per barrel of oil. we are spending hundreds of billions of dollars from our economy to support people who are not necessarily friendly to the United States. It is very important that we as a Senate. act now on this amendment in order to help the United States become less dependent on foreign sources of energy as well as clean up our environment. It is a national security concern. it is an economic concern. and it is an environmental concern. I am very pleased to introduce this amendment today so we can vote on it next week. I think it is very critical that this be part of the package. and that is why it needs to be done as soon as possible. Some may ask why there is such an urgency. Well. because a lot of this type of energy production takes a long time to develop. We do not have a lot of time to set the financing of these projects. We have been told by a lot of industries that if there isnt stability. a lot of these industries are going to go away. We need to be encouraging renewable energy development. Mr. President.

1100200392,Mr. Speaker. I rise today insupport of H.R. 6323. the HeavyDuty Hybrid Vehicle Research. Development. and Demonstration Act of 2008. sponsored by my good friend. Congressman SENSENBRENNER. While most of the attention of hybrid vehicles has been focused on passenger cars. large. heavyduty hybrid trucks have received limited funds for Federal research and development programs. However. because trucks generally use much more fuel per year than passenger cars. the overall potential savings are very significant. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that a typical delivery truck using a hydraulic hybrid system could save up to 1.000 gallons of fuel per year. In light of the proposed savings in fuel use and resulting emissions reduction. the HeavyDuty Hybrid Vehicle Research. Development. and Demonstration Act of 2008 aims to encourage the advancement of the needed technology to bring about these savings. The bill directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a grant program for the development of advanced heavyduty hybrid vehicles. The grants are rewarded in two phases. In phase one. grant recipients are required to build or retrofit one or more advanced heavyduty hybrid vehicles and to collect required data. In phase two. grant recipients are required to produce and/ or retrofit 50 heavyduty hybrid vehicles. collect required data and report on the results. In addition. the bill directs the secretary to conduct a study of alternative power train designs for use in advanced heavyduty hybrid vehicles. Further. it directs the secretary to establish a pilot program through DOEs National Laboratories to research and test the effects on the domestic electric power grid of the widespread use of plugin hybrid vehicles. including heavyduty plugin hybrid trucks. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 6323 passed out of the Committee on Science and Technology with bipartisan support and with input from both sides of the aisle.

Majority Leader HARRY REID. former Vice President Al Gore and others were so focased on saving the planet and global warming and climate change. And I understand theres some concerns there. and Im not oblivious. although all scientists dont agree with that. But. you know. it does really become a matter of priority. And you and I. as physicians understand that people literally without a job. without a home. without a warm set of clothing. they can starve to death. They can die a lot quicker from that than they can over maybe a 75- to 100year period time from inhaling a little bit of an environment thats not healthy for their lungs. So we care about it. We care about childhood asthma. We care about chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema and lung cancer and all those things. But it becomes. really. a matter for leadership of the Congress to make these decisions and place priorities on things. We dont wantthe planet to increase 1 degrees Fahrenheit over the next 75 years because there may be a scintilla rise in the level of the water and some remote island may get flooded and 50 people lose their lives.

1100158207,Madam Speaker. recently I introduced a bill to repeal some of the legislative provisions that have led to an artificial demand for ethanol. H.R. 5911. the Remove Incentives for Producing Ethanol Act of 2008. or RIPE Act. repeals the renewable fuel standard. repeals tax credits for ethanol producers. and repeals tariffs and duties on imported ethanol. These incentives are giving ethanol producers a guaranteed market for their product. Domestic corn. already a heavily subsidized commodity. has been the primary source of biofuel. and the mandate has encouraged farmers to focus agriculture production away from food production toward fuel production. The Department of Agriculture has said that the biofuel mandate has raised fuel prices as much as 20 percent. In addition. ethanols role as a supposed savior for our energy woes has been severely overstated. Ethanol as a fuel yields about 30 percent less energy per gallon than a gallon of gasoline. This is what happens when government picks winners and losers in the economy and the marketplace. Just 4 months ago. we were convinced we had a winner. Its turned out to be a big loser. We need to remove the incentive.

1100154379,Mr. President. I rise today in support of Earth Day. Thirtyeight years ago. 20 million people from across our country celebrated Earth Day for the first time. This has since become an important annual tradition. not only in America. but across the globe. What started as a day to voice concerns over smog. litter and dirty rivers is now a global movement to clean our air. land. and water for future generations. I am pleased that we have found many commonsense solutions to difficult environmental problems since the first Earth Day in 1970. For bxample. in 1978 we banned chlorofluorocarbons in aerosol cans because of their devastating affect on the ozone layer. In 1990 we passed the Clean Air Act Amendments to stop acid rain. And in 2003 we passed the Clear Skies legislation to reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide that pollute our air. Although all of these accomplishments make sense to us today. it wasnt always easy to convince leaders and even the public that these actions were essential to protect our environment. Some folks had concerns about the actual effects of the legislation. while others had concerns about the economic costs. Their concerns are not unlike the concerns ofsome in the current debate about global climate change. A number of my colleagues and I support a cap and trade system. But no matter how we deal with climate change we know that this will be a complex and vigorous debate. The discussions about the impact and costs are legitimate debates to be had. But I firmly believe that inaction is not an answer to this growing crisis. On this Earth Day. which is celebrated by our Federal. State. and local governments. grassroots organizations. citizens of North Carolina. the United States. and the rest of the world. we set out a vision of how things can be. We can be energy independent and secure. we can decarbonize our electric generation. and we can wean ourselves off foreign oil. We can leave the cause of this daythe Earthcleaner and more vibrant.

While this legislation is an immediate response to one proposed acquisition. it will ultimately protect communities across the country. To be clear. I do not mean to oppose all railway transactions. Railways are an extremely efficient means of transportation. and their use can and should increase in response to rising fuel prices. However. transactions like the EJ&E acquisition should only proceed when there is an overall commercial and economic benefit. This is not the case here.

The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates levee construction provides a 6to1 return on flood damages prevented when compared to initial investment cost.

When Madam Speaker became the Speaker in January of 2007. it was clear that her signature issue was this issue of global warming. and shortly after that Al Gore got a Nobel Prize. He shared it with an intergovernmental climate control panel of the United Nations. and of course. he came before the Science Committee and Energy and Commerce Committee.

1100182565,Madam Speaker. according to the Energy Information Agency. the United States electricity demand is projected to increase up to 40 percent by the year 2030. and other countries are projecting similar increases. The rapid industrial development of both China and India is already placing great pressure on global energy supplies. Nuclear energy can help meet this growing demand by providing a clean. abundant source of electricity. Other countries seem to understand the potential benefits of nuclear power and have either commenced constructing. or have developed projections for new nuclear power plants. Countries like China. India. and Russia are already building new nuclear power plants. Even smaller countries like Vietnam and countries in the Middle East have begun exploring nuclear power as they too are facing demand shortages and they are feeling the pressures from the industrialized world to reduce CO2 emissions. The time has come for all of us to remove regulatory impediments and allow nuclear energy to continue helping this country to meet its growing energy demands.,110117140.0,STEARNS,CLIFFORD,H,FL,M,R,6.0,voting,H,2008-07-10,11,Mr. STEARNS,Unknown,STEARNS,Unknown,M,311,343,07102008.txt,1085,168,110,2008,energi inform electr project increas percent project similar increas rapid industri develop china india alreadi place great pressur global energi suppli nuclear energi help meet grow provid clean sourc electr seem understand potenti benefit nuclear either construct develop project new nuclear plant like china india russia alreadi build new nuclear plant even smaller like vietnam east begun explor nuclear face shortag feel pressur industri world co emiss come us remov regulatori impedi allow nuclear energi continu help meet grow energi,106,0.21428571428571427,0.2
