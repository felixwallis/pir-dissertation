2008-06,0,Mrs. DRAKE,2008-06-05,"Mr. Speaker. my district is home to many beautiful American treasures and one of them is the Chesapeake Bay. ""Save the Bay"" is one message that reaches beyond all political boundaries. Working alongside my longtime colleague and friend Jo Anne Davis in the 109th Congress. we passed legislation to create the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historip Trailwhich is part of the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network we are reauthorizing today. As many of you know. this initiative falls under the larger Chesapeake Bay Program. which was created in 1983 to restore and protect the bayI am proud to lend my vote in favor of this bill today. however. I would like to calattention to one of the :greater matters that this Congress should also be voting on: legislation to help the American people pay for the astounding cost of energy. One example is a comprehensive bill by Representative PETERSON that creates a partnership between energy development and the environment. This bill opens up the OCS for natural gas exploration and uses an estimated $86 billion dollars in royalties for environmental restoration efforts. The Chesapeake Bay Commission estimated that the total cost to restore the Chesapeake Bay is $19 billion. The NEED Act fully funds the Chesapeake Bay restoration effort at $20 billion. This energy bill is another way we can help Save the Bay. and the budgets of American families. I am an original cosponsor of the NEED Act and I believe it is an example of bipartisan energy legislation. We must all come together in a bipartisan manner to pass legislation that will increase our domestic energy supply and help alleviate soaring prices. I cannot speak for your districts. but families in Virginias Second District need an energy solution now and it is our job to give them one.",R,Mr. SARBANES,2008-06-05,Mr. Speaker. a couple of points. First of all. the gentleman from Utah spoke to the livelihood of people who work on the Chesapeake Bay. but the biggest threat to those who make their living on the Chesapeake Bay is the decline in the health of the Chesapeake Bay and the fisheries in particular that are in the Chesapeake Bay. So if we have the interests of those people at heart. we ought to be committing ourselves wholeheartedly to this continuing authorization of the* Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network. because it is designed to enhance and improve and protect over the long term the health of the Chesapeake Bay. To address another point. one of the reasons that the Democratic majority has been so steadfast in urging the pursuit of alternatives to fossil fuels in terms of energy sources is to reduce our dependence there. which obviously could go a long way towards the concern over fuel prices and gas prices. But another reason is because it will reduce these greenhouse gas emissions. which. again. impact the environment. If we dont take steps to do that. then there is not going to be any environment for us to enjoy. The Chesapeake Bay Gateways Program. it has been alluded to the fact that this is noncontroversial bill. that it should have come up on suspension. I agree. The minority resisted our desire to have it permanently authorized. and that is why we are in the process we are in today. But that permanent authorization I think is very much a part of the strong statement that we are seeking to make to the citizens in the watershed and to the many millions of visitors who come to the watershed every year. that our national government stands steadfast in this partnership with our citizenry. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.,D,0.9814894
2008-06,1,Mr. FORTENBERRY,2008-06-03,"I thank the gentlelady from North Carolina for yielding. Mr. Speaker. J. Sterling Morton. the founder of Arbor Day and an outstanding Nebraskan. once said. ""Each generation of humanity takes the earth as trustees."" That is the spirit embodied in Arbor Day. The simple act of plantinga tree provides resources and beauty for future generations. and engages in good environmental stewardship. This resolution supports the goals of National Arbor Day and the National Arbor Day Foundation. I would like to begin by expressing my sincere appreciation to the distinguished gentleman from California",R,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois,2008-06-03,"I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. I present for consideration H. Res. 1114. which expresses the support of Congress for the environmental goals and Ideals of Arbor Day and the work of the Arbor Day Foundation. H. Res. 1114. which was introduced by my colleague. Representative JEFF FORTENBERRY. on April 16. 2008. was reported from the Oversight Committee on May 1. 2008 by voice vote. This measure has the support and sponsorship of 53 Members of Congress. and recognizes the importance of Arbor Day and the Arbor Day Foundation in preserving Americas green spaces. J. Sterling Morton. the father of Arbor Day. once observed that. ""The cultivation of trees is the cultivation of the good. the beautiful. and the ennobling in man."" Established in 1872 as a tree planting holiday and celebration. Arbor Day has had a powerful and positive effect on Americas landscape and ecosystem. and is now observed both nationally as well as in many foreign countries. Mr. Speaker. we cant speak about National Arbor Day without mentioning the work of the National Arbor Day Foundation which was created with a mission to inspire people to plant. nurture. and celebrate trees. The Foundation has attracted almost 1 million members to become passionate about conservation and is worthy to be commemorated for their efforts to distribute 10 million plus trees annually for planting. And so I ask. Mr. Speaker. that we show our support of Arbor Day and the Arbor Day Foundation by agreeing to H. Res. 1114. I reserve the balance of my time.",D,0.9852431
2012-03,0,Mr. CORNYN,2012-03-13,"Mr. President. today I come to the floor to express concerns about the Menendez/Burr amendment. to include the NAT GAS Act in the transportation bill. This legislation would provide tax credits to promote natural gas vehicles and refueling infrastructure by imposing a user fee on natural gas fuel used as vehicle fuel. Although the tax credits are detailed in the legislation. it is less certain whether the imposition of a new tax applied to Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) used for transportation will cover the costs of the subsidies. Instead of providing more directives from Washington to the marketplace. Congress should be concerned with the overall access to energy. and the President should work to alleviate the pain caused by his policies which raise energy prices. Companies and consumers can make their own choices about what fuel to use. and what kind of car to drive. We should be out of the game of favoring one choice over another. and ensure that fuel supplies are not unnecessarily restricted. Consumer choice should be the driver of technology in the marketplace. not securing favor in Washington. In fact today consumers can evaluate a myriad of vehicles that fit their needs. from hybrids to traditional gasolinepowered vehicles. In addition. the high cost of gasoline and lower cost of natural gas has already led General Motors and Chrysler/Dodge to announce plans to build natural gas fueled pickup trucks. While the market is already seeing some transition toward natural gas vehicles. President Obamas policies to limit supplies of fossil fuels could cause economic pain for natural gas users in the future. President Obamas support of duplicative. unnecessary regulations at the federal level. raising taxes on producers. and restricting access to federal lands by keeping them offlimits or by slowwalking permits. will result in raising natural gas prices by reducing supply. Unfortunately. the Obama administration continues to enact policies that harm oil and natural gas production. Consider the rising cost of gasoline and the Obama administrations failure to take concrete actions to alleviate the pain Americans are feeling at the pump. The average U.S. price of a gallon of regular gasoline has more than doubled since the week of his inauguration in January 2009. from $1.84 to $3.82. I have great pride for my home state of Texas. and the countless producers and operators who have made Texas the leading U.S. producer of oil and natural gas. and we know that America has only just begun to tap its vast resources. Unfortunately. the Obama administrations proposed offshore oil and natural gas leasing plan for 2012 to 2017 eliminates 50 percent of lease sales provided for in the previous plan. and imposes a moratorium on developing energy from 14 billion barrels of oil and 55 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Expanding access to federal onshore and offshore lands. and eliminating permit delays for leases. could help reduce prices and strengthen our energy security while creating jobs and boosting tax revenues. The moratorium on exploration in the Gulf of Mexico. and persistent delays for permits in shallow and deep water leases. could result in a 19 percent decrease in production in 2012 compared to 2010. according to the Energy Information Administration. At the same time the President highlights our Nations vast natural gas resources. his administration through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is considering burdensome new regulations on which would make securing that fuel much more difficult. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce reports that the EPA alone ""is moving forward with 31 major economic rules and 172 major policy rules"" that affect our energy supply. The Chamber rightly calls this ""an unprecedented level of regulatory action."" Given the Administrations track record with gasoline prices. it is easy to see a similar direction for natural gas prices in the futureparticularly as the EPA continues to propose devastating regulations that lead to the retirement of coalfired electricity generation and ensure greater demand for natural gas in power generation. American energy producers are also deeply worried about the EPAs proposed greenhouse gas regulations. which will serve as an energy tax on all consumers. I know there are natural gas producers and transit authorities in my State who favor this legislation. however. instead of directing demand for a product. I believe we should concern ourselves with ensuring ample supplies of the fuels we need. We should promote access to our Nations natural gas. and discourage duplicative regulations. and stay out of the business of manipulating demand for its use and leave that to the marketplace.",R,Mr. BENNET,2012-03-13,Mr. President. I rise to express my support for the MenendezBurr amendment. No. 1782. dealing with natural gas vehicles. We have an opportunity today to reduce our dependence on foreign oil by diversifying our vehicle fleet to run on a fuel that is not made from crude oil. The MenendezBurr amendmentwhich I cosponsor- would make smart investments designed to spur greater production of vehicles that run on natural gas. Advances in technology have unlocked new reserves of natural gas in this country. And we ought to be using this resourcewhich burns cleaner than any other fossil fuelto power a greater share of our economy. Natural gas is a domestic resource that we now have in relative abundance. Its development has driven economic growth in Colorado and across the Nation. Passage of the MenendezBurr amendment would create even more economic opportunities by building and retrofitting vehicles to run on natural gas. To be sure. natural gas alone is not going to solve our problems. We need to focus on continued increases in vehicle efficiency. We have recently made great strides in that arena. We also need to be sure we are developing natural gas in an environmentally responsible way. Colorado has been a leader on this pointwith the strongest rules in the Nationin ensuring that natural gas development protects communities and drinking water. Nationally more needs to be done to protect those living adjacent to development. I think all States should look to our rules in Colorado as a national model. In short. this amendment will diversify our vehicle fleet. drive continued economic growth in the energy sector. and clean up our airall while reducing our dependence on foreign oil. I urge my colleagues to support the MenendezBurr amendment when it comes for a vote later today. I thank the Presiding Officer.,D,0.9603232

I have come to the floor to talk about an amendment I will offer later todaythe NAT GAS Act. What if I were to tell the Chair there was a transportation fuel that is over $1.50 cheaper than gasoline and roughly $2 cheaper than diesel? What if I were to tell the Chair this fuel is also cleaner and has fewer smogcausing pollutants than diesel and. if wisely used. could reduce the cases of asthma and lung cancer? What if I were to tell the Chair this fuel is abundant right here in America. so much so that we may soon become one of the worlds largest exporters of this fuel? I think I might hear him say: Sign me up. What is the name of this wonderful fuel? The name of this fuel is natural gas. We can see in this chart that as gasoline prices are already skyrocketing toward $4 per gallon. the price of compressed natural gas is barely above $2 equivalent. Natural gas prices used to follow oil prices. but now they are on their own stable. inexpensive price levels. The same holds true for liquefied natural gas. As we can see. gas prices here. liquefied natural gas down here. Diesel prices now exceed $4. and LNG is still hovering around a $2 equivalent Why arent we all driving around in natural gas vehicles. paying a little over $2 per gallon equivalent? The reason this inexpensive fuel is not widely used is because there are not many natural gas vehicles in the United States. and there are also very few places to refuel. Currently. there are nearly 14 million natural gas vehicles in the world but only about 117.000 in the United States. The car and truck manufacturers want to see that the natural gas utilities will invest in refueling infrastructure. and the natural gas utilities want to see more natural gas vehicles on the road. It is a classic chickenortheegg problem. What both the manufacturers and the utilities need to see is a strong stance by the Federal Government to jumpstart this market. The NAT GAS Act will do that by jumpstarting the industry and. in 10 years. add over 700.000 natural gas vehicles to our roads and help incentivize the installation of refueling stations around the Nation. In addition. it is estimated the bill will displace over 20 billion gallons of petroleum fuel and create over 1 million direct and indirect jobs. I know what some of my colleagues are thinking: Isnt this just another handout to energy companies? The answer to that question is a resounding no. This legislation is fully paid for with a small fee on natural gas used as a vehicle fuel. As I mentioned earlier. natural gas is over $1.50 cheaper than gasoline or diesel. This amendment would use some of those savings to help overcome the market barriers for natural gas vehicles and supporting infrastructure. The fee starts at 2.5 cents per gallon equivalent in 2014 and grows to be 12.5 cents in 2020 and 2021. In 2022. the fee is eliminated. In this way. we can still keep natural gas less expensive than other fuel options. while investing in infrastructure to help grow the market. make natural gas vehicles cheaper. and put the industry on a path to flourish on its own. While the legislation itself is designed to provide a temporary boost. it is important to note that the natural gas supplies we are sitting on are enormous. North Americas natural gas resource discoveries have more than doubled over the past 4 years. meaning that at the current rate of consumption. this resource could supply current consumption for over 100 years. If we do not use our natural gas here in America. it will be exported abroad. benefiting consumers in other countries. while American families will continue to pay higher prices at the pump. Already. one U.S. facility has received a permit to export natural gas and four more are following suit. We can use that natural gas in the United States to displace oil. We are sending trillions of dollars abroad to countries that are despotic and wish us ill or we can export it so other countries can gain the benefits. I say we use it here. The NAT GAS Act will also increase our Nations energy independence and make us less dependent on regimes that do not have Americas interests at heart. This is especially important at a time when Iran is attempting to develop a nuclear weapon and is threatening to block oil supplies. Natural gas is not the only solution. but it can be an important part of a solution that will allow us to ignore future OPEC threats because we have alternatives to oil. But until we get to that point. we need to do all we can to supplant oil. It is also important to note that natural gas vehicles are an important way to improve air quality. According to the EPA. natural gas as a vehicle fuel has very low emissions of ozoneforming hydrocarbons. toxins. and carbon monoxide. By producing less of these harmful emissions. natural gas vehicles can reduce smog in our cities and lower incidents of asthma and lung cancer. These health benefits are one reason why Los Angeles County has made almost its entire fleet of 2.200 buses run on compressed natural gas. Let me talk about one issue some are concerned about. While natural gas vehicles can have important environmental and health benefits. we must also keep in mind that natural gas is still a fossil fuel and there are serious risks that need to be weighed when it is extracted. For that reason. I think we need to do better to regulate a practice called fracking. I also believe these risks mean that certain environmentally sensitive areas remain offlimits for fracking. and I will continue to work with my colleagues. such as Senator CASEY. to better formulate Federal rules to protect our drinking water from possible contamination. At the same time. we should not kid ourselves. This amendment will not cause natural gas vehicles to be the main driver of natural gas demand. and fracking is used to extract oil as well. So voting against this amendment will not reduce the amount of fracking. We cannot let this opportunity to use this cheaper fuel to increase our energy security. improve our air quality. and relieve the pain at the pump slip by. It is time to put in place the temporary. fully paid for incentives of the NAT GAS Act to allow the natural gas vehicle industry to flourish. Remember. if one votes against this amendment. they cannot go home and tell their constituents that they have done everything they can to reduce gas prices. I hope our colleagues will join us when the time comes to offer the amendment on the floor and to support it. I suggest the absence of a quorum.,D,0.973801
2013-04,0,Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER,2013-04-23,Im glad you mentioned that because I too believe that we need to be about the business of the American people and helping them make life work. which means helping them in their daytoday activities. not making it harder for folks to survive. Im from southwest Washington. and in our neck of the woods. we have a lot of workingclass families who. like CORY mentioned. are struggling to make ends meet. We all know people who have been or are unemployed. where both parents. one or both parents are out of work. or one or both parents are trying to work. People are working two jobs. and still theyre working longer and harder. but not getting paid more for it. So folks are draining their 401(k)s to make their mortgage payments. This is the climate in which we find ourselves. and thats why it is so. so. so important. like the gentleman from Colorado said. that we employ an allAmerican energy strategy. And the irony is we can do it here and now. Theres no reason to wait. which is why I also have joined the gentleman. We are on the House Energy Action Team. or the HEAT Team. which is a group of likeminded Members who believe we need that allAmerican energy approach. and we need it now. You spoke to some natural gas issues. Ill tell you. in my neck of the woods. in the great Northwest. we get a majority of our energy from clean. renewable hydropower. And the best thing about this clean. renewable hydropower is its inexpensive compared with most other forms of energy. especially renewable energy. So not only is it carbonless and its clean. but its inexpensive. and it is constantly renewed in our backyard. I wanted to point some of these things out because I dont believe hydropower always gets its due. especially among the renewables. but just as a base load energy source in the Nation. Hydropower is Americas largest source of renewable energy. Its American energy. Its produced in America. The jobs that go into producing it are American jobs. and its utilized here in America. It makes up 65.9 percent of all renewable energy in the United States. and it provides more than 30 million homes in the U.S. with inexpensive power. Hydro is clean. It avoids nearly 2 million metric tons of carbon emissions every year. This is a tremendous opportunity for us. Its not only important for families. It does keep our energy bills low and affordable. But its important for manufacturing. We have. in southwest Washington. in my area. in Camas. and in Vancouver. a growing tech sector. Weve traditionally been known for our forests and our beautiful Doug fir stands. but we are also now becoming known for our silicon forest. Were manufacturing chips. One of the reasons some of the large chip manufacturers have come to southwest Washington. as opposed to India or China. is because of the inexpensive energy. because of the hydropower. We need to not only protect it. but promote it as part of the alloftheabove energy approach which. again. is allAmerican energy. Another area when were talking aboutI mentioned clean types of renewables. biomass. Woody biomass is a byproduct of the timber that we have in the Great Northwest. Its another area where we can produce carbonless or lowform energy. And its in our backyard. We have an abundant source. Its an American energy source. Another byproduct of timber manufacturing is black liquor. And its not liquor that you drink. its liquor that can go into helping produce energy. These are the types of ideas and solutions that are going to make energy affordable for the average American family. These are the types of solutions that cause us. rather than to put onerous rules and regulations onoh. I could name a few that cause our energy to spike up and cause Americans to pay morethese are the types of solutions that actually meet the environmental standards. but also reduce the cost of the average power bill. I dont know about youyou could probably speak to this. MARTHAbut. man. our energy bills have gone through the roof. and theres no reason when weve got American energy right here in our backyard.,R,Mr. COONS,2013-04-25,"Madam President. Senator MURKOWSKI of Alaska is a strong leader on energy issues. and I am proud to work with her on the Energy and National Resources Committee. It is fitting that we are here despite representing different States from different regions of the country to talk about an issue we believe can bring us together. Republicans and Democrats alike can agree that when it comes to American energy. we need a comprehensive. alloftheabove strategy. and that is the only way we are going to succeed in securing homegrown and affordable sources of energy for the next generation. In my view. oil and gas are not going away anytime soon. If renewable sources of energy are going to grow and become central players in the American energy marketplace. we have to make sure they are operating on a level playing field. Right now the playing field is anything but equal. For nearly 30 years. traditional sources of energy have had access to a very beneficial tax structure called Master Limited Partnerships. This is a financing arrangement that taxes projects like a partnership. a passthrough. but trades their interests like a corporate stock. This prevents double taxation and leaves more cash available for distribution back to investors. This allows limited partners and general partners to come together and invest capital in a Master Limited Partnership and form an operating company. For the last 30 years. that has been used in natural gas. oil. and coal mining. predominately in pipelines but also in fossil fuels. Not surprisingly. this structure means MLPs have had access to private capital at a lower cost. and that is something capitalintensive projects. such as oil pipelines. badly need. Frankly. it is something alternative energy projects in the United States need more than ever. Lets work together and level this playing field. Lets remove the restriction that allows only traditional energy projects. such as. oil. gas. coal. and pipelines. to form MLPs. It is literally in the original statute that only nonrenewable forms of energy are eligible. In my view. we should open it up to include clean and renewable energy and then let the free market take it from there. So this week. Senator MURKOWSKI and I joined Republicans and Democrats from the House and the Senate to introduce the Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act of 2013a bill that will do just that. We are grateful for the support of Senators JERRY MORAN of Kansas and DEBBIE STABENOW of Michigan. as well as Congressman TED POE of Texas. MIKE THOMPSON of California. PETER WELCH of Vermont. and CHRIS GIBSON of New York. who are original cosponsors. Our bill does not change these benefits for traditional energy sources at all. It doesnt touch existing MLPs and their wellestablished benefits for coal and oil and natural gas. it just allows renewable energy projects to compete fairly by also accessing this tax advantage capital formation field. It gives an equal chance for success for projects using energy from wind and the Sun. the heat of the Earth. and biomass. breakthrough technologies to consumers with affordable homegrown energy for generations to come. This bill is this year a new and improved version of the Master Limited Partnership Parity Act from last year. We introduced a version last year that earned strong support from Republicans and Democrats. as well as outside experts and the business community. This year we are expanding the scope of the bill to also include additional energy projects that qualify as MLPs: waste heat to power. carbon capture and storage. biochemicals. and energy efficiency in buildings. We wanted to include a broader array of clean energy resources because that is how we can get the best competition and deliver the most affordable and efficient energy to consumers from Delaware to Alaska and across our whole country. MLPs are complicated financial structures. but our bill is very simple. It is just a few pages long. It makes one simple tweak to the Tax Code to bring these renewable energy and clean energy projects into the existing structures of MLPs. It is the embodiment of what I have heard from many colleagues in the last 3 years. that we should not be picking winners and losers in energy technology. and we should have an ""all of the above"" strategy. This change. in my view. will bring a significant new wave of private capital off the sidelines and into the renewable energy marketplace. It allows the private sector to look at clean energy in a whole new way. Today. master limited partnerships have reached a market capitalization of close to $450 billion with about 80 percent of it devoted to traditional energy projectsoil and gasand the majority of that to pipelines. Access to this kind of scale of private capital could drive the investment that is essential to creating new jobs in a fast growing new field. It would also. in my view. bring some fairness. some modernization to this wellestablished section of our Tax Code. As the Presiding Officer knows. our Tax Code hasnt been broadly modernized in decades. In the mid1980s. Congress enacted provisions to establish MLPs for oil and gas. timber and coal. and midstream energy industries. This tax benefit hasnt been significantly changed. expanded. or modernized in nearly 30 years. Just to be clear. we are not talking about taking away any of these benefits for any existing beneficiary industry. just updating them to recognize the modern market reality of new energy technologies and to reflect the changing investment opportunities in the emerging markets of renewable energy. In fact. one of the lead cosponsors of this legislation in the House. Congressman TED POEJudge POEa Texas Republican. said at a recent press event we did that over the course of his career. he has represented as many oil refineries as any other Member of Congress. Yet he sees this as an efficient and effective opportunity to expand from its traditional use of pipelines of oil and gas to the broader energy marketplace of the United States. and he is confident expanding this structure to include clean sources of energy would create jobs. I wish to ask the Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. if she has seen the same thing in Alaska. Does the Senator from Alaska see this as an opportunity that will help us grow an ""all of the above"" energy strategy for the United States?",D,0.96440554
2013-04,1,Mr. VALADAO,2013-04-24,In addition to our rich agricultural land. Californias San Joaquin Valley is also blessed with an abundance of oil. natural gas. and renewable energy sources. These resources should be utilized to create jobs. lower energy costs for American families. and reduce our Nations dependency on foreign energy. Instead. misguided public policy and overreaching Federal regulations have cost the Central Valley thousands of jobs and increased the price at the pump for all Americans. Over the last several years. there have been dramatic changes in the energy policy of the United States. And as result. energy prices have significantly increased. Capandtrade legislation failed to pass the House in 2009. However. Washington bureaucrats have already implemented several parts of capandtrade through erroneous EPA regulations. These regulations put limitations on carbon emissions. diminishing oil and gas production in my district. Since 1976. the number of environmental regulations in the Code of Federal Regulations has increased 25fold. Regulations developed and enforced by the Environmental Protection Agency have had a devastating effect on energy production in the Central Valley as the EPA and other members of the Federal environmental bureaucracy continue to wage war on energy producers. costing California thousands of highquality. goodpaying jobs. By taking advantage of the natural resources in California. we can provide Americans with quality jobs. restore our economy. and reduce the struggle families face every day due to high energy costs. The most efficient path toward reducing our dependence on foreign oil and lowering energy costs is an alloftheabove approach that includes conventional sources of energy as well as renewable energy sources such as hydro. solar. and wind power. My district is home to a growing number of wind and solar farms. Developing marketbased energy sources will help the United States meet its energy independence goals. However. in order to meet our countrys energy demand. we must rely on a mix of traditional means while we continue to develop alternative energy solutions for the future. Promoting energy production from Californias Monterey Shale. located directly under my district. could bring in 2.8 million jobs and raise an additional $25 billion in new revenues by the end of the decade. This would not only strengthen the local economy but the States economy as a whole. Natural gas is a safe and responsible energy source with high economic output. In 2010. over 22.750 jobs were created in California alone. Studies show that natural gas production will save each American household approximately $926 per year between 2012 and 2015. Hydroelectric power accounts for 63 percent of the clean power in this country and 8 percent of total electricity. Expanding hydropower production would further increase our energy independence from foreign countries. The Central Valley has the available workforce to construct and operate hydropower facilities throughout the Sierra Nevadas. which would not only produce energy to be used by the entire country but also provide the Central Valley with the ability to store a clean. reliable water supply. My home State of California. and the entire United States. has been blessed with abundant conventional and renewable energy sources. Our constituents should not have to make tough decisions regarding their daily energy consumption when our Nation has the ability to produce enough energy to meet their needs. They should be able to water their yards. cool their homes in the summer. and drive their children to school without facing expensive energy bills and high prices at the pump.,R,Mr. COONS,2013-04-25,"Madam President. Senator MURKOWSKI of Alaska is a strong leader on energy issues. and I am proud to work with her on the Energy and National Resources Committee. It is fitting that we are here despite representing different States from different regions of the country to talk about an issue we believe can bring us together. Republicans and Democrats alike can agree that when it comes to American energy. we need a comprehensive. alloftheabove strategy. and that is the only way we are going to succeed in securing homegrown and affordable sources of energy for the next generation. In my view. oil and gas are not going away anytime soon. If renewable sources of energy are going to grow and become central players in the American energy marketplace. we have to make sure they are operating on a level playing field. Right now the playing field is anything but equal. For nearly 30 years. traditional sources of energy have had access to a very beneficial tax structure called Master Limited Partnerships. This is a financing arrangement that taxes projects like a partnership. a passthrough. but trades their interests like a corporate stock. This prevents double taxation and leaves more cash available for distribution back to investors. This allows limited partners and general partners to come together and invest capital in a Master Limited Partnership and form an operating company. For the last 30 years. that has been used in natural gas. oil. and coal mining. predominately in pipelines but also in fossil fuels. Not surprisingly. this structure means MLPs have had access to private capital at a lower cost. and that is something capitalintensive projects. such as oil pipelines. badly need. Frankly. it is something alternative energy projects in the United States need more than ever. Lets work together and level this playing field. Lets remove the restriction that allows only traditional energy projects. such as. oil. gas. coal. and pipelines. to form MLPs. It is literally in the original statute that only nonrenewable forms of energy are eligible. In my view. we should open it up to include clean and renewable energy and then let the free market take it from there. So this week. Senator MURKOWSKI and I joined Republicans and Democrats from the House and the Senate to introduce the Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act of 2013a bill that will do just that. We are grateful for the support of Senators JERRY MORAN of Kansas and DEBBIE STABENOW of Michigan. as well as Congressman TED POE of Texas. MIKE THOMPSON of California. PETER WELCH of Vermont. and CHRIS GIBSON of New York. who are original cosponsors. Our bill does not change these benefits for traditional energy sources at all. It doesnt touch existing MLPs and their wellestablished benefits for coal and oil and natural gas. it just allows renewable energy projects to compete fairly by also accessing this tax advantage capital formation field. It gives an equal chance for success for projects using energy from wind and the Sun. the heat of the Earth. and biomass. breakthrough technologies to consumers with affordable homegrown energy for generations to come. This bill is this year a new and improved version of the Master Limited Partnership Parity Act from last year. We introduced a version last year that earned strong support from Republicans and Democrats. as well as outside experts and the business community. This year we are expanding the scope of the bill to also include additional energy projects that qualify as MLPs: waste heat to power. carbon capture and storage. biochemicals. and energy efficiency in buildings. We wanted to include a broader array of clean energy resources because that is how we can get the best competition and deliver the most affordable and efficient energy to consumers from Delaware to Alaska and across our whole country. MLPs are complicated financial structures. but our bill is very simple. It is just a few pages long. It makes one simple tweak to the Tax Code to bring these renewable energy and clean energy projects into the existing structures of MLPs. It is the embodiment of what I have heard from many colleagues in the last 3 years. that we should not be picking winners and losers in energy technology. and we should have an ""all of the above"" strategy. This change. in my view. will bring a significant new wave of private capital off the sidelines and into the renewable energy marketplace. It allows the private sector to look at clean energy in a whole new way. Today. master limited partnerships have reached a market capitalization of close to $450 billion with about 80 percent of it devoted to traditional energy projectsoil and gasand the majority of that to pipelines. Access to this kind of scale of private capital could drive the investment that is essential to creating new jobs in a fast growing new field. It would also. in my view. bring some fairness. some modernization to this wellestablished section of our Tax Code. As the Presiding Officer knows. our Tax Code hasnt been broadly modernized in decades. In the mid1980s. Congress enacted provisions to establish MLPs for oil and gas. timber and coal. and midstream energy industries. This tax benefit hasnt been significantly changed. expanded. or modernized in nearly 30 years. Just to be clear. we are not talking about taking away any of these benefits for any existing beneficiary industry. just updating them to recognize the modern market reality of new energy technologies and to reflect the changing investment opportunities in the emerging markets of renewable energy. In fact. one of the lead cosponsors of this legislation in the House. Congressman TED POEJudge POEa Texas Republican. said at a recent press event we did that over the course of his career. he has represented as many oil refineries as any other Member of Congress. Yet he sees this as an efficient and effective opportunity to expand from its traditional use of pipelines of oil and gas to the broader energy marketplace of the United States. and he is confident expanding this structure to include clean sources of energy would create jobs. I wish to ask the Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. if she has seen the same thing in Alaska. Does the Senator from Alaska see this as an opportunity that will help us grow an ""all of the above"" energy strategy for the United States?",D,0.9673925
