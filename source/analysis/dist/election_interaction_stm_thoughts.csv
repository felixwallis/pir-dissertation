16,46375,Mr. Speaker. a report released last week by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration examined the relationship between climate change and the extreme weather events from last year. The report found compelling evidence that humancaused climate change contributed to many of the extreme weather events seen around the world last year. including some of the heat waves and droughts seen in the central United States. as well as elevated sea levels that contributed to the unprecedented level of flooding in New York City after Superstorm Sandy. The report. based on the work of 78 scientists. concluded that climate change has an impact on extreme weather events. These storms and droughts are endangering lives and livelihoods. and costing taxpayers billions of dollars. Unfortunately. we are failing to address these threats in the House of Representatives. The Republican majority of the House has refused to acknowledge the overwhelming scientific evidence that the planets climate is changing. and that human activity is a major contributor to this change.,USA
16,45313,Mr. Speaker. the Safe Climate Caucus is composed of 25 Members of the House who have made a commitment to talk every single legislative day on the House floor about the urgent need to address climate change. Mr. Speaker. on Tuesday. we reached record levels of carbon in the atmosphere. Since 1956. a U.S. observatory has been recording data on the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. and over the last few decades. carbon dioxide levels have been higher than at any point in the last 800.000 years. So theres more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today than since the dawn of civilization. This month. the amount of carbon is close to reaching 400 parts per million. a new record. And as a result. extreme weather events are going to be evermore frequent and more damaging. We must act before its too late. Our window to address the threat of climate change is closing. Its time to stop the denials and to start acting proactively.,USA
16,46210,"Thank you. Mr. President. I want to thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his kind words. He is a real expert and a leader on climate change. and I look forward to continuing to work together with him and our colleagues on this important issue. He has just discussed the overwhelming evidence that global temperatures are rising. I would like to build on his remarks and add that temperature is not the only indicator that climate change is real and it is happening now. We see the changes in Hawaii and all over the world. One only need to look to the top of the world. where Arctic Sea ice is melting faster than scientists had predicted originally. Just last summer. the ice covering the Arctic Ocean retreated to its smallest size in recorded history. shrinking by 350.000 square milesan area about the size of Venezuela. Glaciers continue to retreat. The Greenland ice sheet provides a stark example of the rapid recession of the worlds ice. For several days in July of 2012. Greenlands surface ice cover melted more than at any time in 30 years of satellite observation. During that month an estimated 97 percent of the ice sheet thawed. Some types of severe weather are also on the rise. While climate scientists are extremely careful not to attribute any single weather event to climate change. there is no doubt that increased climate change has ""loaded the dice."" which means extreme weather events are increasingly likely. Extreme weather events cost us in lives and in money. Of course. the sea level continues to rise. As water warms. its volume expands. Scientists have observed that the top layer of the worlds oceans has stored an enormous amount of heat. raising sea levels in many parts of the world. This ocean warming has contributed to an estimated onethird to onehalf of the increase in sea level rise to date. Sea level rise is a serious challenge for my home State of Hawaii in particular. Just a 3foot rise in sea level. which scientists project for this century. will flood many parts of Honolulu. including the iconic hotels and businesses along Waikiki Beach. leaving beaches eroded and hotels. businesses. and homes possibly inundated by the ocean. My colleague from Rhode Island. an ocean State. is especially aware of these changes.",USA
16,45289,Mr. Speaker. I rise today to continue the work of the Safe Climate Caucus in focusing on the threats posed to our Nation by climate change. The worlds top scientific institutions are all telling us that we have a rapidly closing window to reduce our carbon pollution before the catastrophic impacts of climate change cannot be avoided. The World Bank recently answered the question of why we should address climate change. Their report described what the world will look like if we continue on our current path. According to the World Bank. a world that warms by 4 degrees Celsius would suffer from unprecedented heat waves. the flooding of coastal cities. increased risks of food and water scarcity. severe droughts. and irreversible damage to ecosystems. Coral reefs would dissolve due to ocean acidification unmatched in the Earths history. Extreme heat waves would likely become the new normal for summertime. With impacts like these. it is clear that we cannot allow 4 degrees of warming to occur. There is widespread agreement that we must act. Members of the House must take action.,USA
16,45387,Mr. Speaker. I implore my colleagues to address the global climate process. A recent academic study found that 97 percent of scientists agree that human activity is mainly responsible for climate change. That same study concluded that the public has been misled into thinking that there is a difference in thinking among scientists on this. but 97 percent of scientists agree that this is a problem. How much longer will science deniers and their supporters in Congress spread misinformation about the facts and the dangers of climate change? It is a fact that we have more carbon dioxide in our atmosphere than at any time in the past 3 million years. As a member of the Safe Climate Caucus. I urge all of my colleagues to recognize the dangers of climate change and to come together and address this problem ASAP. We dont have much time to lose.,USA

The excellent assessment report that it published last year concluded that warming of the climate system is unequivocal, with many natural systems now affected.

REs. 98 Whereas the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (in this resolution referred to as the Convention""). adopted in May 1992. entered into force in 1994 and is not yet fully implemented. Whereas the Convention. intended to address climate change on a global basis. identifies the former Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern Europe and the Organization For Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). including the United States. as ""Annex I Parties"". and the remaining 129 countries. including China. Mexico. India. Brazil. and South Korea. as ""Developing Country Parties"". Whereas in April 1995. the Conventions ""Conference of the Parties"" adopted the socalled ""Berlin Mandate"". Whereas the ""Berlin Mandate"" calls for the adoption. as soon as December 1997. in Kyoto. Japan. of a protocol or another legal instrument that strengthens commitments to limit greenhouse gas emissions by Annex I Parties for the post2000 period and establishes a negotiation process called the ""Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate"". Whereas the ""Berlin Mandate"" specifically exempts all Developing Country Parties from any new commitments in such negotiation process for the post2000 period. Whereas although the Convention. approved by the United States Senate. called on all signatory parties to adopt policies and programs aimed at limiting their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. in July 1996 the Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs called for the first time for ""legally binding"" emission limitation targets and timetables for Annex I Parties. a position reiterated by the Secretary of State in testimony before the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate on January 8. 1997. Whereas greenhouse gas emissions of Developing Country Parties are rapidly increasing and are expected to surpass emissions of the United States and other OECD countries as early as 2015. Whereas the Department of State has declared that it is critical for the Parties to the Convention to include Developing Country Parties in the next steps for global action and. therefore. has proposed that consideration of additional steps to include limitations on Developing Country Parties greenhouse gas emissions would not begin until after a protocol or other legal instrument is adopted in Kyoto. Japan in December 1997. Whereas the exemption for Developing Country Parties is inconsistent with the need for global action on climate change and is environmentally flawed. and Whereas the Senate strongly believes that the proposals under negotiation. because of the disparity of treatment between Annex I Parties and Developing Countries and the level of required emission reductions. could result in serious harm to the United States economy. including significant job loss. trade disadvantages. increased energy and consumer costs. or any combination thereof: Now. therefore. be it Resolved. That it is the sense of the Senate that(1) the United States should not be a signatory to any protocol to. or other agreement regarding. the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change of 1992. at negotiations in Kyoto in December 1997. or thereafter. which would(A) mandate new commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for the Annex I Parties. unless the protocol or other agreement also mandates new specific scheduled commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for Developing Country Parties within the same compliance period. or (B) would result in serious harm to the economy of the United States. and (2) any such protocol or other agreement which would require the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification should be accompanied by a detailed explanation of any legislation or regulatory actions that may be required to implement the protocol or other agreement and should also be accompanied by an analysis of the detailed financial costs and other impacts on the economy of the United States which would be incurred by the implementation of the protocol or other agreement. SEc. 2. Tte Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy of this resolution to the President.",USA
20,863,"Mr. President. I rise today to voice my support for Senate Resolution 98 regarding the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. Like my colleagues in the Senate. -I too am concerned about the effects on the economy of any national or international agreements that the United States enters into. I am particularly concerned with any agreement that may impact the wellbeing of the American public and the ecological balance of this Nation. The U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change has the potential to do both. The United States is scheduled to join with leaders of 160 nations in Kyoto. Japan in December of this year to conclude negotiations on a global climate change treaty. The Kyoto summit is the latest in a series of meetings that have been held since this body ratified the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992. At Kyoto. the United States and other countries hope to adopt a protocol or legal instrument to deal with the threat of climate change in the post 2000 period. It is my belief that the United States must take the leadership role in these negotiations. and steer the course to achieve an equitable. reasoned approach to global climate change mitigation. an approach that seeks inclusion of all countries and that offers a solution to the issue. While I believe the resolution before us will allow such an approach. I want to emphasize to the administration the essential nature of a negotiated framework to which all countries can accede. Before I summarize my analysis of the need for global action. let me review the facts. First. global climate change is real. If it were not. 160 countries would not be meeting to address it. However. there are uncertainties about the effects of global climate changeuncertainties relative to the timing. the magnitude. and regional patterns of climate change. We must acknowledge these uncertainties. but acknowledge also that they do not justify inaction. As stated recently by Dr. William Nordhaus of Yale University: ""The results (of studies) definitely reject inaction. uncertainty alone cannot justify waiting for the revealed truth to act. particularly when the revealed truth. if it ever comes. is probably going to arrive at the point where the effects are irreversible."" Second. a leading indicator of climate change is increased emissions of global greenhouse gases. Concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxidethe largest component of greenhouse gas emissionsare about 26 percent higher now than they were 100 years ago. Also. globally averaged air temperatures at the Earths surface have warmed by nearly 1 degree Fahrenheit over the last 100 years. Increased emissions of greenhouse gases are virtually entirely due to the activities of man. As a general rule. a countrys greenhouse gas emissions rise in concert with increased industrialization. It is no surprise. then. that the United States is the greatest emitter of greenhouse gases. both in terms of gross and per capita emissions. However. the emissions of some developing countries are rapidly escalating. and the emissions of some are expected to surpass that of this country in the first quarter of the next century. Which takes me back- to my call for U.S. leadership. As the worlds industrial leader. the United States should take a clear lead in negotiating a framework for all countries to participate in global climate change abatement. A global approach. and global participation. is requisite to a successful outcome. This approach may require a new framework and a fresh look at timetables and current directions. My understanding of the data is that we have time to do thiswe have time to assess where we are and how best to craft equitable policies. But inaction is not appropriate. The resolution before us requires commitments of developing countries to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in the same timeframes as developed countries. This may -resonate as promoting a policy that discourages the participation of many developing countries. However. the resolution will allow developing countries appropriate flexibilities in commitments to address global climate change abatement. The United States and other developed countries must accord newly developed and developing countries flexibilities and incentives to participate. and these need not create economic disadvantages to the United States or any other developed country. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of this point. Without all countries on board. inaction becomes inevitable. because emission reductions achieved by one country will soon be offset by increased emissions from another. An equitable approach that encourages commitments by all parties and that offers incentives to developing countries is needed. Marketbased solutions to curb emissions will allow continued economic growth with minimal impacts. Developed countries are in a better position to implement emissionscurbing activities and technologies at low cost and impact. and to also transfer these abilities and technologies to developing countries and to aid in their economic advancement in a way that tempers emissions growth. While measures to stabilize greenhouse gases at a certain level will inevitably lead to some energy price increases. an international emissionstrading scheme could substantially reduce the potential costs. What is needed. however. is a policy to ensure that incremental costs of reducing or stabilizing emissions are eqdalized across firms. across sectors. and across countries. This can only occur if we take into account the economies. emissions and abilities of countries to participate. and if we assign actions accordingly and in appropriate timeframes. Market mechanisms can reduce cost impacts of emissions reductions agreements. A preferable policy would be to set short- and longterm goals to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions. and to set quantity limits on emissions that are linked to prices. Targets and timetables for emission limitations cannot operate independently of market prices. An international tradeable emissions permits system. with price caps and floors. would have revenue potential and would be costefficient. Technology transfer and development is an important policy aspect for the abatement of global climate change. The United States and other developing countries have within our current capabilities technologies which can lead to dramatic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. We can increase the efficiencies ot industry. of transportation. of many energyintensive activities. all with what we already know. By implementing these capabilities and by transferring these technologies. to developing countries we can curb emissions significantly. Continued technology development is also necessary. Lastly. -and perhaps most importantly. we must continue to advance the science related to these policies. and to allow policy changes as the data warrant. Mr. President. I conclude my remarks by repeating that I. too. am concerned about any agreements or policies that effect the well being of this country. However. I believe it is in our best interests and that of the world -community to approach global climate change in an inclusive. proactive manner that seeks continued economic growth. That approach demands action. and global coalition building. and it is incumbent upon the United States to steer that course.",USA
20,848,Mr. President. if the Senator will yield. no. that is not my intention. That is not what the resolution says. I have stated previously that under this resolution the developing world must fully participate in the treaty negotiations and commitments and must play a meaningful role in effectively addressing the problem of global climate change. Such participation by the developing country parties could. in my judgment. come in a number of forms. As I stated before the Foreign Relations Committee. while individual countries have different levels of development. the resolution holds that each country must make unique and binding contributions of a pace and kind consistent with their industrialization. The developing world must agree in Kyoto to adopt some manner of binding targets and commitments which would begin during the same compliance period as the-,USA
20,457,Mr. President. press reports today from the annual economic summit of the worlds major industrial powers in Denver indicate that there was pressure on the United States from some of our allies to make new commitments to deep cutbacks on greenhouse gas emissions. specifically. carbon dioxide emissions. It is unfortunate that some of our allies. including the French in particular. chose this forum to change the terms of international dialogue on this issue. I commend President Clinton for resisting these surprising. new pressure tactics to shortcut the progress towards a rea.sonable solution at Kyoto and to try to force the United States to endorse an immediate commitment to unworkable new goals. thereby. shredding the negotiating process. We and the French are both part of negotiations intended as a followup to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. the socalled Rio Pact. signed in 1992. and approved by the Senate. The Rio Pact called upon the industrialized nations to aim to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to their 1990 levels by the year 2000. a goal which will not be achieved by the U.S. or by most of the industrialized nations. As a result of the failure of most of the industrialized world to meet this voluntary commitment to reduce Carbon dioxide emissions. the parties met in Berlin in 1995 to discuss the future direction of the treaty. In Berlin. the United States agreed that new commitments should be binding upon the signatories. but the developing world was excluded from any new commitments. Unfortunately. excluding the developing world. which will be the most important emitter of carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2015. exceeding the emissions of the OECD nations. was a mistake. The solution. if it is to be effective. must include all major emitting nations or it will fail to really get the problem under control. More than that. the perceived unfairness of forcing limits on the economies of only some nations. but not others. will cause political pressure to frustrate the approval and implementation of any treaty that is signed in Kyoto this December. The temptations of industries to flee from the U.S. for example. behind the safe nonbinding walls of Mexico. for instance. or other developing nations. will both frustrate the goals of a treaty and unfairly penalize the developed economies. Therefore. Mr. President. the distinguished Senator from Nebraska. Mr. HAGEL. and I authored a Sense of the Senate Resolution indicating that it is imperative for the developing world to be parties to any binding commitments made in Kyoto. that those socalled commitments should demonstrate unequivocally an action program to approach this problem in a realistic way. and that everyone should start with aggressive efforts to act on those commitments immediately and not settle for vague promises to return to future negotiations to get serious. While some countries have different levels of development. each must make unique and binding contributions of a kind consistent with their industrialization. The developing world must agree in Kyoto to some manner of binding commitments which would begin at the same time as the developed world with as aggressive and effective a schedule as possible given the gravity of the problem and the need for a fair sharing of the burden. Mr. President. in Denver during the last two days. some nations put pressure on the United States to agree to a whole new set of commitments beyond those agreed to in Rio. beyond the target of stabilizing at 1990 levels by the year 2010. Those nations sought to get the U.S. to agree to a 15 percent reduction by 2010. a level of reduction which would have very serious impacts on major sectors of the U.S. economy. There were no discussions of bringing the developing world into the play. I highly commend President Clinton for resisting these surprising new pressures to deviate from the Kyoto track. and set targets for very sharp new levels of reductions. Those nations should know that the United States Senate stands strongly behind the President in resisting these pressures. Reductions must be fair. .wellmanaged. wellplanned. and spread across the globespread across the globe. In addition. Mr. President. a wideranging new set of initiatives is needed to harness technology. to engage in new crash research and development technologies to mitigate the carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion. as .well as new energy efficiency programs. and cooperative programs between the developed and developing world. We have only begun to match the targets of carbon dioxide reductions and limitations with our technological genius and to engage in pioneering a new energy frontier type program aimed at using mans genius to tackle this global problem from every conceivable angle. I reiterate. Mr. President. that President Clinton is to be commended for resisting the pressure for these sudden draconian commitments. Mr. President. i yield the floor.,USA
20,22386,"Mr. President. I want to address a growing misperception concerning the European Unions ability to meet its obligations under the Kyoto Treaty. There are many climate change skeptics who claim that the EU will not be able to meet their greenhouse gas emission reduction targets under the Kyoto Treaty. In turn. they argue that the U.S. should not participate in any ""cap and trade"" system for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Under the Kyoto Treaty. the EU has committed to greenhouse gas reductions target of 8 percent below their 1990 emission levels and covers the years 2008 through 2012. This target is shared by the 15 EU member states. EU15. that existed at the time of the EU ratification of the protocol in May 2001. An additional 10 countries joined the EU in May 2004. eight of which -have individual targets under Kyoto that range from 6 to 8 percent below the 1990 levels. Two of them. Malta and Cyprus. are developing countries and. therefore. do not have any emission targets under the treaty.. In December 2005. the EU. as required by the Kyoto Treaty. reported on the progress made toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The report indicated that EU policies and actions by member states to date have made annual carbon dioxide emissions reduction$ of 5.5 percent in the year 2003 across all 25 of the EU member states. EU25. The report makes the following assessments: For the EU15: Existing measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that are projected to be 1.6 percent below the year 1990 levels in 2010. Savings from additional domestic policies and measures being planned by the EU15 would result in total emission reductions of 6.8 percent. EU15 member states forecast that they will be able to achieve lower emissions of 9.3 percent below the year 1990 levels through the use of the Kyoto flexibility mechanisms inthe year 2010. They include such activities as emissions trading. forest sequestration. and participating in International projects -that result in greenhouse gas reductions through the Joint Implementation and Clean Development Mechanism programs. For the EU25: The total of all member states projections of greenhouse gas emissions will be 5 percent below base year levels in. 2010 as a result .of measures already implemented. The implementation of additional measures is projected to reduce the EU25 greenhouse gas emissions to 9.3 percent below 1990 levels by 2010 and. with the use of Kyoto flexibility mechanisms. to 11.3 percent below the year 1990 levels. The December 2005 report concludes that the EU15 states can meet their target of 8 percent below the 1990 levels if the additional domestic measures and the Kyoto flexibility mechanisms that are planned are implemented. According to the February 14. 2006 statement of the acting head of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Richard Kinley.. 34 industrialized countries under the Kyoto Treaty were ""on their way to lower their emissions levels by at least 3.5% below the 1990 levels during the firstcommitment period."" ""With the help of additional measures and the use of Kyoto marketbased mechanisms. they will as a group be able reach their agreed Kyoto reduction targets."" In June. the European Environment Agency issued the Annual European Community Greenhouse Gas Inventory 19902004 and Inventory Report 2006. The report indicates that the EU15 greenhouse gas emissions for 2004 increased -by 0.3 percent11.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalentsover 2003. However. compared to the base year. emissions in 2004 were 0.9 percent lower. Assuming a linear target path from 1990 to 2010. total EU15 greenhouse gas emissions were 4.7 index points above this target path in 2004. It should be noted that this linear target path is not intended as an approximation of past and future emission trends. It does provide a measure of how close the EU15 emissions are in 2004 to a linear path of emissions from 1990 to the Kyoto target period of 2008-. 2012. assuming that only domestic measures will be used. Therefore. it is not a measure of future compliance .of the EU15 with its greenhouse gas emission targets in 20082012. but aims at evaluating overall EU15 greenhouse emissions in 2004 alone. The EU is fully committed to the Kyoto Treaty. It has adopted a series of policies and measures. such as the EUs greenhouse gas emissions tradingscheme. to meet its target in a costeffective manner. The most recent projections show that these measures. together with the EUs participation in the global carbon market. will allow the EU to meet its target. To ensure its compliance with the Kyoto Protocol. the EU has adopted a series of measures under the European Climate Change Programme. ECCP. Most of these measures have recently entered into force and will start to show their full effect over the next few years. These include: The EU greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme. the promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources. the promotion of cogeneration. CHP. increasing the energy performance of buildings. the promotion of the use of biofuels for transport. the reduction of landfilling of biodegradable waste I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD documents from the European Commission and the European Environmental Agencys reports which summarize the EUs efforts to address climate change.
