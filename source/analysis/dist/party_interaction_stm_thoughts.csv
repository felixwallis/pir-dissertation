5,22388,"Mr. President. attachment I gives a full overview of all recently adopted measures and their projected effect. ECCP policies and other actions by Member States to date. in combination with restructuring of European industry. particularly in Central and Eastern Europe. have contributed to an absolute reduction of annual carbon dioxide emissions of some 305 million tonnes. 4.8 percent. across the EU25 in 2004. Attachment II provides an overview of the performance of individual Member States. In 2004. the EU15. which shares the EUs Kyoto target of an 8 percent reduction. had reduced their greenhouse gas emissions by 0.9 percent compared to 1990 levels even though they recorded economic growth of 32 percent from 1990 to 2004. The average EU15 member states emissions over the most recent 5year period are currently 2 percent below 1990 level. Attachment III provides an overview of the planned use by individual Member States of the Kyoto mechanisms. The EU will make use of the costeffective reduction options offered by its participation in the global carbon market. based on the Kyotos flexible mechanisms. to meet its target. In summary Mr. President. the EU has made good progress and its ultimate success will depend upon the speed and thoroughness of the implementation by Member States of legislative and domestic measures. Total projections for the EU15 Member States show that the Kyoto targets can be -met if Member States implement additional planned domestic measures and use the flexible mechanisms. Despite this meaningful progress. the EU realizes that much more has to be done. Its climate change policy does not stop in 2012. the end of the Kyoto Treaty. The European Commission has also adopted a Communication outlining key elements for a strategy for further action post 2012. They include: the need for broader participation by countries and sectors. the development of lowcarbon technologies. the continued and expanded use of marketbased instruments. and the need to adapt to the inevitable impacts of -climate change. A followup Communication with proposals for concrete"" steps at European and international- levels is planned for the end of 2006. These policies. and others like them. provide the necessary strong. longterm signals to industry. EU Member State governments. and the wider international community that the EU is committed to tackling climate change and expects all of its institutions. businesses. and citizens to do their part. Many here in the US will try to use another countrys failure or inaction as an excuse for not doing anything. But it is just that. an excuse. The harsh reality is that we all need to be doing moreand that means the United States too. Just as we cannot allow the EU challenges to serve as the basis for our inaction. I certainly hope that the EU would not allow our lack of action to hinder their efforts to address this significant problem.",USA
5,42537,Mr. Speaker. Tony Blair was the Prime Minister of Great Britain and was considered to be a political liberal. and perhaps his actions didnt always match his words. but I would like to read a statement he made at one point. Mr. Blair said: The role of government is to stabilize and then get out of the way as quickly as possible. Ultimately. the recovery will be led not by the government but by industry. business. and the creativity. ingenuity. and enterprise of people. If the measures you take in responding to the crisis diminish their incentives. curb their entrepreneurship. and make them feel unsure about the climate in which they are working. the recovery becomes uncertain. That was Tony Blair. Then Thomas Donohue. the president of our national Chamber of Commerce. said at a jobs submit about a year and a half ago here in Washington: The regulatory activity presently going on is so far above and beyond anything we have ever seen in the history of this country. that we are in danger of becoming a government of. by. and for the regulators instead of a government of. by. and for the people. I thought of these two things when I read a letter recently from one of my constituents who runs a small bank in east Tennessee. He wrote to me. He said: One of the single greatest needs of small business is access to capital. and much of that small business lending capital is typically provided by Americas more than 6.700 community banks. Yet. community banks are by and large being forced to withhold and constrain lending at the time America needs it most. This is largely due to unprecedented onerous regulatory constraints being placed on community banks by Federal bank examiners. He goes on and says this: Never in modern history have banks. especially community banks. been under great pressure by banking regulators. Much of that pressure is unprecedented. virtually ignoring or redefining historic standards and definitions of bank examining. Routinely. banks are being required by bank examiners to classify and put into a nonaccrual status loans that are current on their payments. In many cases. this be can far more than half of all of the classified loan assets. This is enormously inconsistent with historic bank examination practices. And I go on. quoting from this letter: In most cases. this results in a banks capital being constrained and consequently may well lead to a forced merger of these banks by the Fed into the larger banks. Despite acknowledgement by the Fed that the two big banks represent a systemic threat to the U.S. and global banking systems. the big banks seemingly are allowed to keep getting bigger. That is a serious problem. It was the toobigtofail banks that got us into the mess that we got into in the first place. and now many of the smallest banks in this country are being forced out of existence or forced to merge. So the big keep getting bigger and the small and the mediumsized ones are having a real struggle to survive. Finally. this bank who wrote to me said: If America is going to have economic recovery and jobs depend on it. banks must not only be allowed to lend. but encouraged to lend. Instead. they are largely being constrained from lending with much of that constraint attributable to overly aggressive bank examination. By and large. most U.S. banks are having to shrink in size in response to the Feds pressure. which translates into reduced lending. We have been going through a period of time in which President Bush and his Secretary of the Treasury at the tail end of their administration started saying this and then President Obama and his Secretary of the Treasury then saying it. They have been saying loan. loan. loan. and then the local bank examiners having been saying no. no. no. and it has been holding us back. This country could be booming beyond belief right now. but were holding it back in so many ways. and we will never come out and have a full and complete recovery unless that atmosphere changes. I heard a talk this morning by Governor Mitch Daniels of Indiana. and he said that our employment rate is less than 64 percent now. He says that is the lowest its been since the era of stayathome moms. He said over a third of adult children are now living at home with their parents. which is way above what it has been in the past. In fact. we have an unemployment rate that is far too high. but our underemployment rate is perhaps even much higher. All across this country you have college graduates who are working as waiters and waitresses in restaurants or in other lowpaying jobs because they have gotten college degrees and cant find good jobs because weve sent so many good jobs to other countries in recent years and because our regulatory environment is holding this country back and keeping it from booming as it should be right now.,USA
5,28156,Mr. President. we have just started this discussion. and I think it is a big one. I think it is an important one. whether we should be dependent upon European governments for Pur global reach in military for our aircraft. That is what tankers provide us is a global reach and whether we should be dependent on the European governmentsupon the French. upon the Germans. upon the Britsfor our global reach. I dont think we should be. I think we have to look at the subsidization of this cost by the Europeans. I think that needs to be discounted and taken out of this proposal. I think we have to look at a longterm project. and we are going to be talking about this a lot before we go forward with thisas Chancellor Merkel called it. this giant success for Airbus and the European aviation industry. It may have been that it is at our cost. I am not going to stand still and let it happen. I yield the floor.,USA
5,43058,Madam President. in 2005 the European Union began their emissions trading scheme. which attempts to cap emissions of carbon dioxide from stationary sources within the EU. Starting in 2012. civil aviation operators departing from or landing in Europe began to be included in this emissions scheme. Under this program. any airline. including nonEuropean airlines flying into and out of Europe. will be required to pay for EU emissions allowances. This change comes at a time when EU allowance prices continue to decline to a little over 6 euros. and the commission is considering proposals to drive up the prices. Allowances will be collected for the entirety of the flight. including portions in U.S. and international airspace. For example. this means a flight leaving from Los Angeles. CA. and flying to London would be taxed on the entirety of the flight. not just the fractional part of the flight that is over EU airspace. To put it another way. you would be taxed as if 100 percent of your flight was in EU airspace even though approximately only 7 percent of the flight actually was. that is. a flight originating in California here in the United States and flying to London. Very simply. the unilateral imposition of such a scheme on the United States and other countries is arbitrary. unfair. and a violation of international law. Plus. it is being done without any guarantees for environmental improvements and at a huge cost to the aviation industry and constituents we serve here in this country. According to the International Air Transport Association. the economic cost of this program for airlines is expected to be $1.3 billion in 2012. Let me repeat that: $1.3 billion in 2012. It is expected to reach as high as $3.5 billion by the year 2020. Those are revenues coming out of the airlines in this country that would be used to pay for this feethis tax. if you willimposed by the EU on U.S. airspace. By requiring commercial aviation to comply. the EU ETS also limits airline capital that could be available for other meaningful purposes. including their ability to invest in more fuelefficient engines. alternative sources of fuel. and research and development. No one in Congress is against the EU implementing ETS within their boundaries. However. I believe that any system that includes international and other nonEU airspace must be addressed through the International Civil Aviation Organization. the ICAO policies. of which the United States and 190 countries are members. In fact. under current ICAO standards. the aviation industry is targeted to achieve a 1.5percent average annual improvement in carbon and fuel efficiency through 2020 and carbonneutral growth from 2020 forward. That is why the U.S. airline industry and those advocates in the industry also agree that a single global approach to greenhouse gas emissions set at the ICAO is preferred to the unilateral EU ETS system. Even the Obama administration testified before the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure in July of 2011 that an EU ETS is inconsistent with international aviation law. The State Department and the U.S. Department of Transportation are also pressing this issue with their counterparts in Europe and are considering all legal and policy options to prevent further application of EU ETS to U.S. air carriers. In addition. other nations have voiced opposition. Those nations include Argentina. Brazil. China. India. Japan. the Republic of Korea. Mexico. the Russian Federation. and South Africa. In fact. Chinas Ambassador to the EU recently suggested that they will begin canceling Airbus orders if the EU ETS remains in place. Also. countries such as Italy. the Netherlands. France. Belgium. and Spainall EU member statesare calling for the postponement of EU ETS out of concerns raised by the international community. Even European manufacturers and airlines such as Airbus. Air France. and British Airways have urged their respective governments to stop the escalating trade conflict between the EU and the rest of the world. The EU has no right to play policeman and undermine the ongoing work at the ICAO. As a result of this action by the EU. on December 7. 2011. I introduced the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme Prohibition Act. S. 1956. which now has seven cosponsors. both Democrats and Republicans. The bill gives the Secretary of Transportation the authority to take the necessary steps to ensure that Americas aviation operators are not penalized by any system unilaterally imposed by the EU. The bill also requires the Secretary of Transportation. the Administrator of the FAA. and other senior U.S. officials to use their authority to conduct international negotiations and take other actions necessary to ensure that U.S. operators are held harmless from the action of the European Union. The House of Representatives passed a similar bill by a voice vote on October 24. 2011. The U.S. commercial aviation community. including airlines and manufacturers. are all supportive of my bipartisan bill. Next month. I am looking forward to the Commerce Committee hearing that is scheduled to take a closer look at this important issue and at my legislation. Doing nothing is not an option. The unilateral imposition of the EU emissions trading scheme is a violation of international law and is hurting U.S. airlines. manufacturers. and consumers. Keep in mind that with near record oil prices. the EU ETS will add to the already high amount airlines and passengers pay for fuel. We need to act now. We need to send a clear and unequivocal message and pass my bipartisan bill that addresses this scheme and protects the U.S. aviation industry and American sovereignty. I hope we will act on this legislation and make sure that this issue. once and for all. is put to rest and that the European Union is not able to assess a tax or a fee on American airlines operating in American airspace. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum,USA
5,41618,"I thank the gentlelady for yielding to me. Mr. Speaker. I also rise in opposition to this legislation. I think Mr. MARKEY made an articulate case and a compelling case. If we expect European companies to comply with U.S. laws when they do business in our country. whether the EU countries agree with our laws or not. we have to respect their laws. But this bill. H.R. 2594. prohibits U.S. airlines from complying with the laws of the European Union. Worldwide aviation is estimated to produce about 3 percent of the total manmade greenhouse gas emissionsand these emissions are rising rapidly. In an effort to address aviations uncontrolled contribution to climate change. the EU has adopted a cap on greenhouse gas emissions from the aviation sector. The EU program sets modest and achievable emission limits. it is flexible and marketoriented. and there is no viable alternative approach based on regulating only those emissions that occur in a countrys own airspace. The EU program also should benefit U.S. aircraft and engine manufacturers such as Boeing and Pratt & Whitney. which are building more efficient engines today. The program will encourage airlines to purchase new aircraft with lower fuel costs. boosting the economy and potentially saving consumers money. As a matter of fact. I just got off a plane today from the European Union. and I would hate to think that when I travel on an American airline they will not respect the laws of the European Union or the European Union might decide they dont have to respect our laws. I urge a ""no"" vote on this bill.",USA
5,38608,"Let me declare an interest in that I recently went to Bangladesh as a guest of Oxfam. I am sure that I join the whole House in paying tribute to the excellent work of British development non-governmental organisations around the world. In Bangladesh, I saw Oxfam's work in raising awareness of the impact of climate change on some of the world's poorest. Although the Government's commitment to continue the work on development and climate change is welcome, the commitment of the international community still falls short. Ahead of Cancun, what steps will the Government take to push for a greater commitment on climate finance from other countries?",UK
5,35792,"I am not sure that walking out is a great way of achieving progress, but that shows that the United Nations framework convention on climate change talks have a history, I am afraid, of mistrust, so progress has been too slow. That is why we have to find other forums, such as the Major Economies Forum that we hosted in London, to pursue success. The truth is that the way to overcome that history of mistrust is to do what the EU and, indeed, Britain has done, which is to start to break the deadlock in the negotiations-for example, by saying to developing countries that we are willing to make a financial contribution so that they can make the necessary changes in their economies.",UK

5,33488,"Today's meeting reaffirmed the commitment to the millennium development goals. It is also important for countries not just to sign up to such goals, but to do what is necessary. I very much hope that Copenhagen is a success, but as the hon. Lady will know, while most Governments accept that climate change is a reality and that we need to do something about it, that view is not universally held. Moreover, some countries which acknowledge that climate change is a problem are not willing to do as much about it as they should. Today's meeting, however, showed that if there is a will, there is a way of getting through this, and the same spirit must be shown in Copenhagen later this year.",UK
5,35669,"My right hon. Friend is absolutely right, in the sense that one of the key things that many of the poorest countries in the world face today is not just the challenge of getting out of poverty, but having to adapt to climate change, which will hit some of them the hardest. That is why it is vital that we do agree on climate change financing in the run-up to Copenhagen. This will be discussed by G20 Finance Ministers at the weekend; however, it is important that it be seen as separate from the funding that will be provided to help some of the poorest countries out of poverty.",UK
