11,19473,Madam Speaker. in July of this year. the President signed into law .the Energy Policy Act of 2005. which enacted the firstever renewable fuel standard in order for a portion of our Nations fuel supply to be provided by renewable domestic fuels like ethanol from corn and biodiesel made from soybeans. This provision is an example of public policy that is moving in the right direction. For example. E85. a blend of 85 percent ethanol fuel. is becoming more and more available in the Midwest and it costs less at the pump. Just this week in my southern Illinois district. E85 was on average 22 cents cheaper than regular gasoline at the pump. In some cases. E85 stayed below. $2 per gallon. The expanded use of renewable fuels like E85 helps stretch domestic oil supply and decrease our reliance on foreign imports of oil. As we all know. no crude oil refineries have been built in the United States since 1976. During that time. close to 100 ethanol* refineries have been built. It is my hope that this growth continues to happen. Renewable fuels are an environmentally friendly. domestic alternative fuel source that we can utilize to increase U.S. supply- and decrease our reliance on foreign imports of oil.,USA
11,23318,Mr. Speaker. would it be correct if I asked about the long title of this bill? Is the long title of this bill. to reduce our Nations dependency on foreign oil by investing in clean. renewable. and alternative energy resources. promoting new emerging energy technologies. developing greater efficiency. and creating a Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve to invest in alternative energy?,USA
11,23112,Mr. President. I rise to speak briefly on this essentialpiece of legislation commonly referred as tax extenders. This is. in many ways. also an energy security bill that is worth being proud of. There are a host of important tax items here. many of which were implemented under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Now we extend many of these items through 2008. There are extensions of credit for electricity produced from renewable resources until December 31. 2008. This is clean energy produced from wind. biomass. geothermal and hydropower. It is critical to our Nations future and these tax credits will play an important role in our energy security over the next decade. There are extensions of credits to holders of clean renewable energy bonds. There are extensions of credits,USA
11,27010,"Mr.- Speaker. over the next 40 years. electricity demand in the United States will double. We have to conserve. We have to make strides in efficiency and renewable energy. but we cant depend on renewable power alone. It would"" take 3.000 huge windmills or 11 square miles of solar collectors to equal the power output of one modern coal plant. Even if we quadrupled the share of renewable power by 2050. we will still need coal for half of our electricity. To meet Americas future energy needs. we will probably need to build 800 new coal plants over the next 40 years: 400 to replace the old. inefficient plants and 400 to meet the growth and demand. This translates to one coal plant every 2 to 3 weeks. even if we start in Solving the problem will require clean coal technologies with zero emissions. including greenhouse gases. Lets solve Americans energy problems by cleaning up Americas abundant energy resources. This bill. however. will tax Americas abundant supplies of coal. and that just doesnt make sense.",USA
11,19055,Mr. President. I rise today to support the Energy bill conference report. For many years. I have supported passage of a comprehensive national energy policy. Such a policy is necessary to reduce our increasing dependence on foreign energy sources. A comprehensive energy policy will help lower energy prices in the long run. Furthermore. any farreaching bill will move us toward newer technologies that will keep our economy growing strong while making us more energy independent. Although not perfect. this energy bill moves -us in the right direction. It will expand our electricity transmission system and make it more reliable. The bill contains incentives for renewable energy. including the renewable energy production tax credit that I helpedinclude. It will also spur an increase in the production and use of domestic biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel. Because of this bill. our coalburning plants will improve their efficiency and emit less pollution. Finally. the bill provides needed incentives to increase natural gas infrastructure. measures that will lead to lower prices for natural gas consumers in the long run. Equally important. this bill benefits North Dakota for a number of reasons. The transmission incentives will enable my States power producers to export electricity to distant markets. In this way. transmission incentives benefit the lignite and wind energy sectors in my State. The clean coal production incentives will make it easier to build. advanced clean coal powerplants. The inclusion of the wind energy production tax credit will help North Dakota realize its potential to be the biggest producer of wind energy in the country. The Renewable Fuels Standard and tax incentives for ethanol and biodiesel will aid my States farm economy. create more jobs. and reduce our dependence on foreign oil. In addition. the bill will assist my State in developing exciting new technologies. such as coaltoliquid fuel plants. I believe we still have a lot of work to do in crder to make our Nation less dependent on foreign energy. However. this bill takes positive steps to address our energy needs. As I just mentioned.,USA
11,12807,"My hon. Friend seems to be saying that there is a need for nuclear energy to complement and support renewable energy. However, nuclear energy provides the dearest electricity on the wires. The one industry in which we should invest in order to support renewables is the coal industry. Does she agree that we need investment in clean coal technology?",UK
11,43598,"I oppose the motion. I suspect that I will be the only person to do so. It is not because we cannot have green economy. We could—indeed, we once had a totally green economy. We relied on windmills to grind our flour, on watermills to saw our wood, on horsepower for transport, and on biomass—as burning wood is now called—for heat, but we abandoned those when we discovered that coal could fuel a steam engine, that oil could fuel the internal combustion engine, and that gas and nuclear could give us electricity. Since then, we have enjoyed huge increases in our material standard of living based very largely on comparatively cheap energy from fossil fuels.",UK
11,22614,"We have done an enormous amount of good work on renewable energy, but the one area that we have neglected is the potential renewable energy that is locked into the ground. We are considerably behind certain other countries in developing ground source heat pumps and geothermal techniques, for example. Will my right hon. Friend undertake to examine the potential for providing heat for our homes from this renewable source?",UK
11,14199,"Is my hon. Friend aware that the integrated gasification plant being built in my constituency by Coalpower is capable not only of producing electricity without any toxic emission, but of capturing enough hydrogen to power the local bus fleet? Does he agree that the development of hydrogen power is so crucial to the future of the environment that the Government should play a major role in developing that technology?",UK
11,26414,"My hon. Friend the Minister rightly mentions the institute at Loughborough, and we welcome the announcement of the energy technology institute and the £1 billion that it will bring, which will be focused on Loughborough. He talks about potential, but will he visit Intelligent Energy, a company that has a hydrogen fuel cell motorbike ready for production? We talk about potential, but what can his Department do to assist companies that are ready to produce the vehicles and fuel cell technology that will drive this country forward? We must not just talk about potential but ensure a marketplace for such vehicles.",UK
