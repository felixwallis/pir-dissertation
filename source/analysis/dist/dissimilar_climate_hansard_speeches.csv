2001-11-06,0,Stephen O'Brien,2001-11-06,"Can the hon. Gentleman help me? I have listened carefully to his comments. Of course his support for many of the points that were made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) is welcome, but it is notable that unlike on past occasions the Liberal Democrats have not tabled an amendment to the Conservative party's motion. Could he or the one other Liberal Democrat who is attending the debate shed light on whether that is because of incompetence, lack of care or because they agree with the motion and intend to vote with us? Possibly, consistent with Liberal Democrat policy, it is all three.",Conservative,Elliot Morley,2001-11-06,"The hon. Gentleman makes a reasonable point about self-regulating organisations. However, in the Environment Agency's defence, I was greatly involved in the problem of flooding. Although its regulation is a matter for my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment, I am aware that it identified the drums of BSE-contaminated waste. It made that fact public, took immediate action to make them safe and suspended the licence. Although he is entitled to raise those concerns, the agency's response was rapid and efficient. We should acknowledge what it did to secure the site and ensure that his constituents' interests were safeguarded from a potential threat.",Labour,0.61792225

It is certainly an improvement on their previous one on spin. If they are to be true to their intention to talk about public services and to reconnect with the electorate, today's debate is a step in the right direction. However, if they are to succeed in that task, they must put forward some positive policies. There was precious little of that in the contribution of the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green), and precious little about any aspect of education outside schools in their manifesto. I shall concentrate on further education for adults.",Labour,0.7505298
2004-03-02,0,Roger Gale,2004-03-02,"All people of good will on both sides of the political divide in Cyprus would like to see a settlement prior to the accession of Cyprus to the European Union. That being so—this point has already been made—there will have to be referendums on both sides of the green line. As a guarantor power, what steps is the United Kingdom taking to ensure that there is international monitoring of the referendums to guarantee that they, in turn, are free and fair?",Conservative,David Crausby,2004-03-02,"There is much to welcome in the Bill, which will protect members of pension schemes. The Bill contains new rights for those who have been let down and suffered badly because of the insolvency of a scheme. To lose a pension after a lifetime of hard work is devastating, especially when it hits those who are close to retirement and who do not have either the energy or the opportunity to pull it back.",Labour,0.5995563

It is a bit of debating fun, but the truth of the matter is that, like the Government, the Conservative party has changed its mind on this matter. The Government have been informed by events, and they consulted on their Green Paper and had a pretty clear answer. The moral hazard is present in all forms of insurance, but Governments should act on the immoral hazard of people losing their pensions.",Labour,0.6077172
2014-06-19,0,Gregory Barker,2014-06-19,"Let me reassure the hon. Lady that this Government are 110% committed to solar. What is more, when we came into office there were a few megawatts of solar and there are now thousands of megawatts of solar. More than 3 GW of solar have been installed under this Government. We have a fantastic record and there is lots more to come, but the changes to which she referred simply refer primarily to large field-based solar",Conservative,Nia Griffith,2014-06-19,"Constituents are still phoning us about problems with green deal suppliers, particularly those who take the money for the survey and then do not come up with the goods in spite of numerous phone calls. This often occurs over different areas, so it is not necessarily appropriate for just one local trading standards officer to take up the matter. Will the Minister consider talking to his colleagues in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills about having a more thorough investigation into what is happening on the ground with these companies?",Labour,0.47518027

They find, like many of their members, that energy bills take up a large chunk of their limited budgets. What can the Minister offer to improve their energy efficiency and so help these important community institutions to stay open?",Labour,0.49127895
