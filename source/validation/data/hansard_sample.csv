For rural parts of Northern Ireland, Norfolk and any other rural region of the United Kingdom, the car is a necessity. Parents have to take their children to school—they cannot keep them at home. They have to travel to the shops, because the arrival of the supermarkets means that many local shops have closed. We must therefore face the reality: we are not talking about a luxury, and we are not even talking about alternative modes of transport. For example, for people in rural parts of my constituency and other rural areas of Northern Ireland, the only alternative transport would be a horse and cart. Do we want to go back to those days? There are no buses or trains in rural parts, but we are now going to say to the people there that they cannot even use their cars because of fuel costs.",2008-07-09,William,McCrea,"['uk.org.publicwhip/member/2263', 'uk.org.publicwhip/member/2264', 'uk.org.publicwhip/member/2265', 'uk.org.publicwhip/member/2266', 'uk.org.publicwhip/member/90074', 'uk.org.publicwhip/member/679', 'uk.org.publicwhip/member/90198', 'uk.org.publicwhip/member/1376', 'uk.org.publicwhip/member/90307', 'uk.org.publicwhip/member/40539', 'uk.org.publicwhip/lord/101464']","{('1983-06-09', '1985-12-17'): 'Mid Ulster', ('1986-01-23', '1987-05-18'): 'Mid Ulster', ('1987-06-11', '1992-03-16'): 'Mid Ulster', ('1992-04-09', '1997-04-08'): 'Mid Ulster', ('2000-09-21', '2001-05-14'): 'South Antrim', ('2005-05-05', '2010-04-12'): 'South Antrim', ('2010-05-06', '2015-03-30'): 'South Antrim'}","{('1998-06-25', '2003-04-28'): 'DUP', ('2000-09-21', '2001-05-14'): 'DUP', ('2003-11-26', '2007-01-30'): 'DUP', ('2005-05-05', '2010-04-12'): 'DUP', ('2007-03-09', '2010-07-01'): 'DUP', ('2010-05-06', '2015-03-30'): 'DUP'}",South Antrim,DUP,2008,agre hon friend happi acknowledg point come speak rural constitu mani peopl view car even two car famili luxuri realiti rural part northern ireland norfolk rural region unit kingdom car necess parent take children keep home travel shop arriv supermarket mean mani local shop close must therefor face realiti talk luxuri even talk altern mode transport exampl peopl rural part constitu rural area northern ireland altern transport would hors cart want go back day buse train rural part go say peopl even use car fuel cost,87

More importantly, it also provides training and work experience for people who want to work in the media industries. That has attracted students to Bristol universities to study media, broadcasting and journalism. Many people have worked on ""Casualty""—not only the actors and extras who are seen on screen, but lighting engineers, set designers, camera operators, technicians and writers—and used that experience to move on and set up their own production companies, to work on other programmes or go to the natural history unit.

They were brought into being at the end of the second world war when world leaders then realised that the IMF would be necessary. However, its role, while still very necessary, needs to adapt, and I think that it can play a greater role in relation to early warnings and greater supervision of problems that arise in the financial system. That is not the only thing that we need to do. We need to ensure that our regulatory bodies co-operate through the colleges of regulators that are now being set up, and other reforms will be necessary as well.

The reason why I announced this week our intention to legislate for children's trusts on a statutory basis, with all those agencies, including schools, properly signed up to the children and young person's plan, was so that we could entrench that long-term early intervention culture that is necessary to keep children safe and to ensure that every child can fulfil their potential and that every barrier to their happiness, well-being and learning is addressed early on.

We may reach this point later, but having looked at the Bill, in my opinion it may create some confusion. If the proposed amendments to the Animals Act clarify the law, they do so by reverting to the old-fashioned law of negligence, as I understand the Bill's intention. The problem with that is that, although it is tried and tested and has developed over centuries, it provides a field day for lawyers as to what is or is not negligent, what is or is not a breach of duty and whether a duty is owed in some circumstances under the Donoghue  v. Stevenson principle. We may talk about snails later and how they got into the bottle of ginger beer. In fact, it was never discovered whether there was a snail in the first place, but that is another story. The basic principles of negligence are wide open for argument. One of my concerns is that if the Bill is enacted we will see a lot more cases going to court with argument about whether the circumstances were negligent than we do under the existing arrangements where we have a modicum of strict liability, which is a lot clearer and more likely to lead to an earlier settlement of claims where people have been injured as a result of somebody else's animal.",2008-03-14,Andrew,Dismore,"['uk.org.publicwhip/member/169', 'uk.org.publicwhip/member/853', 'uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628', 'uk.org.publicwhip/member/200001', 'uk.org.publicwhip/member/200002']","{('1997-05-01', '2001-05-14'): 'Hendon', ('2001-06-07', '2005-04-11'): 'Hendon', ('2005-05-05', '2010-04-12'): 'Hendon'}","{('1997-05-01', '2001-05-14'): 'Labour', ('2001-06-07', '2005-04-11'): 'Labour', ('2005-05-05', '2010-04-12'): 'Labour', ('2012-05-03', '2016-05-05'): 'Labour', ('2016-05-05', '2024-02-04'): 'Labour'}",Hendon,Labour,2008,would tend agre hon friend may reach point later look bill opinion may creat confus propos amend anim act clarifi law revert oldfashion law neglig understand bill intent problem although tri test develop centuri provid field day lawyer neglig breach duti whether duti owe circumst stevenson principl may talk snail later got bottl ginger beer fact never discov whether snail first place anoth stori basic principl neglig wide open argument one concern bill enact see lot case go court argument whether circumst neglig exist arrang modicum strict liabil lot clearer like lead earlier settlement claim peopl injur result somebodi els anim,103

Friend the Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth told me of his satisfaction at the success of the multi-agency approach co-ordinated by the Gold Command set up in Northumberland in September. Those involved showed what can be accomplished through strong partnership work. The successful evacuation of Morpeth is an example: it started at noon in the High Stanners area and full evacuation was under way by 4 o'clock, led by the local authority and supported by the emergency services and the Environment Agency. Approximately 180 fire and rescue personnel were used on Saturday, with all 22 appliances in Northumberland being utilised. Mutual aid assistance was given by neighbouring fire and rescue services, and the operation was supported by Northumberland Mountain Rescue, Northumbria Police Marine Rescue and the RSPCA. Fire and rescue people-carriers, as well as minibuses, were used to transport evacuated residents to rest centres, helping approximately 300 members of the public to reach safe accommodation at the height of the evacuation.

In the west midlands, there are seven metropolitan authorities. Let us suppose that there are seven members of the passenger transport authorities, although that is not quite the case. The west midlands is a swing area, which is, unfortunately, controlled predominantly by the Conservatives at the moment. Let us also suppose that a few years ago, Labour, predominating among those seven councils, had appointed six—a minority on the PTA—of these non-elected members for a four-year term. Elections take place in the west midlands authorities three out of every four years, so in practical terms there is an election every year. During the four-year term of the six appointed members, the predominant control could change so that there were two Labour and five Conservative authorities. As Labour had packed the PTA with six non-elected members on a four-year term, however—our party would not do that, but we are talking about a hypothetical situation—despite the fact that the preponderance within the metropolitan authority would have changed, there would be a majority on the ITA of Labour representatives; there would be six ""placemen"" and two from the two remaining local authorities.

There is a cost-benefit analysis for each measure, as we heard from the hon. Member for Nottingham, South. Each scheme has a cost and a return. The idea that the presumably higher rate tax relief for many investors delivers the best bang for the buck in delivering improved energy efficiency is extremely implausible. The investment will be made in tiny chunks. The scale of investment needed for such things is vast.
