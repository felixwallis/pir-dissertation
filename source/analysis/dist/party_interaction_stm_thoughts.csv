6,34693,Madam Speaker. if this energy tax passes. the estimated job loss or my district is an average of 3.702 jobs per year from 2012 through 2035. If this bill passes it will mean financial ruin for thousands of my constituents. 5th CD Gross State Product Loss for 2012: $361.7 million 5th CD Gross State Product Loss on average from 20122035: $720.1 million 5th CD Personal Income Loss in 2012: $458.7 million 5th CD Personal Income Loss on average from 20122035: $265.7 million 5th CD Nonfarm Job Loss in 2012: 4.552 5th CD Nonfarm Job Loss on average from 20122035: 3.702
6,42918,Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the Keystone XL pipeline as well as the underlying bill. The plot here is for jobs. American jobs. Its a nobrainer. Like most Arkansans. I support this projobs project that will strengthen our national security by making us less dependent on Middle Eastern oil. Arkansas families and businesses are hurting due to high gas prices. and the Keystone pipeline will bring an additional 1 million barrels of oil per day into the United States. More supply means lower prices. and Arkansans. as well as all Americans. need relief from these high gas prices. President Obama denied construction of the Keystone XL pipeline despite years of extensive vetting for environmental impacts. Make no mistake. the Presidents decision to reject the Keystone pipeline has cost American jobs. Welspun. a manufacturer in my district. has manufactured nearly half of the pipe for the Keystone pipeline and was forced to lay off 60 workers after the President rejected the pipeline. after he delayed it last year. The Keystone pipeline will strengthen American energy security and create tens of thousands of good American jobs. Its past time to move the Keystone pipeline forward.
6,40747,Madam Speaker. 9.2 percent unemployment in June. Twentynine months in a row of over 8 percent unemployment. Twenty million Americans remain unemployed or underemployed. It has to stop. These are stark reminders that President Obamas excessive spending. unprecedented debt. and overregulation. as well as the threats of jobkilling taxes on small businesses and entrepreneurs. are holding back private sector job creation in our economy. American job creators fear the regulatory and fiscal environment they will face in the near future. Until they have some certainty. they will not invest or hire. We are working hard to bring back that certainty and ensure our progrowth economic environment. By doing that. we must cut red tape. cut spending. and keep taxes low. but also pass legislation to expand domestic energy production and open new markets for American goods overseas. We need President Obama and his party to stop trying to raise taxes on job creators and instead embrace our commonsense proposal to put Americans back to work.
6,41166,Mr. Speaker. last Thursday the President addressed a joint session of Congress in order to describe his second stimulus. This proposal would create $447 billion in new spending. being paid for by tax increases. House Republicans remain committed to working together in order to create job growth and promote an environment that allows for small businesses to hire workers. Sadly. the administrations proposal pushes new taxes on small businesses. which would create an environment that destroys jobs. The President was previously correct. saying you do not increase taxes in a recession. Raising taxes destroys jobs. The administrations last stimulus added $814 billion to our debt. More importantly. it failed to accomplish the goal of keeping unemployment below 18 percent. Currently. 14 million people are unemployed and 25 million who want a fulltime job do not have one. The House Republicans have passed numerous bills to create jobs. House Republicans have shown their commitment to jumpstarting the ability of small businesses to create jobs. In conclusion. God bless our troops. and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. JOBS
6,38072,"Mr. Speaker. with the U.S. unemployment rate steadily hovering around 10 percent. Americans continue to ask. ""Where are the jobs?"" The answer to this crisis from congressional Democrats and the Obama administration is. higher taxes. increased government spending. and more government regulation. The passage of ObamaCare. capandtrade in the House. and financial regulation has created an atmosphere of tremendous uncertainty. especially among small businesses. which employ over half of all the private sector employees. Uncertainty. as we all know. is the enemy of growth. investment and job creation. The way out of this recession and towards job creation is enact policies that free up capital. reduce uncertainty. and restore confidence in our economy. We cannot do this if the administration and Congressional Democrats continue to impose costly regulations. higher taxes on job creators. and create uncertainty in the marketplace."
11,19473,Madam Speaker. in July of this year. the President signed into law .the Energy Policy Act of 2005. which enacted the firstever renewable fuel standard in order for a portion of our Nations fuel supply to be provided by renewable domestic fuels like ethanol from corn and biodiesel made from soybeans. This provision is an example of public policy that is moving in the right direction. For example. E85. a blend of 85 percent ethanol fuel. is becoming more and more available in the Midwest and it costs less at the pump. Just this week in my southern Illinois district. E85 was on average 22 cents cheaper than regular gasoline at the pump. In some cases. E85 stayed below. $2 per gallon. The expanded use of renewable fuels like E85 helps stretch domestic oil supply and decrease our reliance on foreign imports of oil. As we all know. no crude oil refineries have been built in the United States since 1976. During that time. close to 100 ethanol* refineries have been built. It is my hope that this growth continues to happen. Renewable fuels are an environmentally friendly. domestic alternative fuel source that we can utilize to increase U.S. supply- and decrease our reliance on foreign imports of oil.
11,23318,Mr. Speaker. would it be correct if I asked about the long title of this bill? Is the long title of this bill. to reduce our Nations dependency on foreign oil by investing in clean. renewable. and alternative energy resources. promoting new emerging energy technologies. developing greater efficiency. and creating a Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve to invest in alternative energy?
11,23112,Mr. President. I rise to speak briefly on this essentialpiece of legislation commonly referred as tax extenders. This is. in many ways. also an energy security bill that is worth being proud of. There are a host of important tax items here. many of which were implemented under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Now we extend many of these items through 2008. There are extensions of credit for electricity produced from renewable resources until December 31. 2008. This is clean energy produced from wind. biomass. geothermal and hydropower. It is critical to our Nations future and these tax credits will play an important role in our energy security over the next decade. There are extensions of credits to holders of clean renewable energy bonds. There are extensions of credits
11,27010,"Mr.- Speaker. over the next 40 years. electricity demand in the United States will double. We have to conserve. We have to make strides in efficiency and renewable energy. but we cant depend on renewable power alone. It would"" take 3.000 huge windmills or 11 square miles of solar collectors to equal the power output of one modern coal plant. Even if we quadrupled the share of renewable power by 2050. we will still need coal for half of our electricity. To meet Americas future energy needs. we will probably need to build 800 new coal plants over the next 40 years: 400 to replace the old. inefficient plants and 400 to meet the growth and demand. This translates to one coal plant every 2 to 3 weeks. even if we start in Solving the problem will require clean coal technologies with zero emissions. including greenhouse gases. Lets solve Americans energy problems by cleaning up Americas abundant energy resources. This bill. however. will tax Americas abundant supplies of coal. and that just doesnt make sense."
11,19055,Mr. President. I rise today to support the Energy bill conference report. For many years. I have supported passage of a comprehensive national energy policy. Such a policy is necessary to reduce our increasing dependence on foreign energy sources. A comprehensive energy policy will help lower energy prices in the long run. Furthermore. any farreaching bill will move us toward newer technologies that will keep our economy growing strong while making us more energy independent. Although not perfect. this energy bill moves -us in the right direction. It will expand our electricity transmission system and make it more reliable. The bill contains incentives for renewable energy. including the renewable energy production tax credit that I helpedinclude. It will also spur an increase in the production and use of domestic biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel. Because of this bill. our coalburning plants will improve their efficiency and emit less pollution. Finally. the bill provides needed incentives to increase natural gas infrastructure. measures that will lead to lower prices for natural gas consumers in the long run. Equally important. this bill benefits North Dakota for a number of reasons. The transmission incentives will enable my States power producers to export electricity to distant markets. In this way. transmission incentives benefit the lignite and wind energy sectors in my State. The clean coal production incentives will make it easier to build. advanced clean coal powerplants. The inclusion of the wind energy production tax credit will help North Dakota realize its potential to be the biggest producer of wind energy in the country. The Renewable Fuels Standard and tax incentives for ethanol and biodiesel will aid my States farm economy. create more jobs. and reduce our dependence on foreign oil. In addition. the bill will assist my State in developing exciting new technologies. such as coaltoliquid fuel plants. I believe we still have a lot of work to do in crder to make our Nation less dependent on foreign energy. However. this bill takes positive steps to address our energy needs. As I just mentioned.
