6,34693,Madam Speaker. if this energy tax passes. the estimated job loss or my district is an average of 3.702 jobs per year from 2012 through 2035.

6,42918,Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the Keystone XL pipeline as well as the underlying bill. The plot here is for jobs. American jobs. Its a nobrainer. Like most Arkansans. I support this projobs project that will strengthen our national security by making us less dependent on Middle Eastern oil. Arkansas families and businesses are hurting due to high gas prices. and the Keystone pipeline will bring an additional 1 million barrels of oil per day into the United States. More supply means lower prices. and Arkansans. as well as all Americans. need relief from these high gas prices. President Obama denied construction of the Keystone XL pipeline despite years of extensive vetting for environmental impacts. Make no mistake. the Presidents decision to reject the Keystone pipeline has cost American jobs. Welspun. a manufacturer in my district. has manufactured nearly half of the pipe for the Keystone pipeline and was forced to lay off 60 workers after the President rejected the pipeline. after he delayed it last year. The Keystone pipeline will strengthen American energy security and create tens of thousands of good American jobs. Its past time to move the Keystone pipeline forward.,USA
6,40747,Madam Speaker. 9.2 percent unemployment in June. Twentynine months in a row of over 8 percent unemployment. Twenty million Americans remain unemployed or underemployed. It has to stop. These are stark reminders that President Obamas excessive spending. unprecedented debt. and overregulation. as well as the threats of jobkilling taxes on small businesses and entrepreneurs. are holding back private sector job creation in our economy. American job creators fear the regulatory and fiscal environment they will face in the near future. Until they have some certainty. they will not invest or hire. We are working hard to bring back that certainty and ensure our progrowth economic environment. By doing that. we must cut red tape. cut spending. and keep taxes low. but also pass legislation to expand domestic energy production and open new markets for American goods overseas. We need President Obama and his party to stop trying to raise taxes on job creators and instead embrace our commonsense proposal to put Americans back to work.,USA
6,45402,"Mr. Speaker. its been almost 5 years since the application to build the Keystone XL pipeline was filed. Its also been almost 5 years that Americans have been waiting for the jobs and energy security Keystone would provide. How much longer will President Obama make us wait? American families expect our government to pursue the least expensive. most reliable domestic energy. Jobless Americans expect that their President wont stand in the way of economic relief. But on both fronts. President Obamas choice to cede to environmental special interests and block the Keystone pipeline in 2011 did the opposite. It denied thousands of jobless Americans the chance at highpaying work and blocked a direct connection between refineries in Texas and affordable energy in Canada. But whats more audacious about the Presidents economically indefensible action is the fact that it is groundless. The Presidents own State Department concluded ""no significant"" environmental damage would be caused by Keystones completion. The Keystone pipeline has jobs to offer. Why is the President turning those jobs away?",USA
6,46603,Mr. Speaker. Republicans have again recklessly threatened Americas future by allowing the Nation. already in a Republican shutdown. to default on its debt unless the Congress votes to stop ObamaCare. The government has been shut down for 2 weeks. and the United States will default on its debt in 2 days. All respected economists say a default means devastating and definitely unnecessary damage to our economy and to the global marketplace. Yet Republicans radically and irresponsibly push us toward the precipice of default. Their disconnect from financial reality is certainly breathtaking. Their actions are reckless. radical. and irresponsible. Mr. Speaker. there is power in numbers. If reasonable Republicans would stand up to their radical right wing. we could end this shutdown and avoid a default today.,USA
6,51530,"I am grateful to the Minister. He talks about an environment in which wages are rising. Wages are rising in some areas, but public sector workers have seen a tremendous reduction in their income capacity, and many of them will be affected massively by what the Government want to do. The Government need to think more about public sector workers, whose wages are not going up.",UK
6,43535,"The reason increased employment in the public sector destroys jobs in the private sector is that every public sector job has to be paid for by the private sector. The public sector creates no wealth. It spends wealth that is taxed from the private sector. If it does not come from tax immediately, it comes from delayed taxation through borrowing. That is the connection. Increasing employment in the public sector increases the burden on the private sector and destroys the ability of the private sector to compete globally.",UK
6,37992,"I want to talk about jobs in south Wales, and the future jobs fund in particular. I do not believe the Government's Budget will help boost employment in my constituency and in Wales. Instead, there is a great danger of the Budget reducing growth and increasing unemployment. Jobs are important in Blaenau Gwent. My constituency has the high unemployment rate of almost 12%. We used to rely on coal and steel, but those days are gone; now we need to develop a more balanced economy. We need green jobs, digital jobs and better services. We need to help those who have been unemployed back into work. We need the future jobs fund or a similar employment initiative, and, most important, we need it now.",UK
6,42978,"Again, my hon. Friend is absolutely right. We have very low interest rates in an environment in which many other European countries have much higher interest rates. That is a reflection of market confidence in the UK’s deficit reduction plan, and of course if we had pursued the path advocated by the Opposition—the same path that led us into this economic mess—we would be paying a higher interest rate, and there would be higher interest rates and families would have higher mortgage bills.",UK
6,38673,"The deficit was 2.5% of national income before the crisis-the recession-hit all around the world. It went up all around the world; it was a global economic recession. The question is: should we cut too far and too fast, which is what the Prime Minister is doing, so that there are four years of sluggish recovery-the most sluggish recovery from recession in 40 years? Why does the Prime Minister not answer the question? Is this the most sluggish recovery from recession in Britain for the last 40 years? Yes or no?",UK
