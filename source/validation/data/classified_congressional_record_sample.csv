1110033606,"Mr. President. I rise before you today to speak on an issue that I have brought to the Senate Floor before and have been watching for quite some time now. I would like to submit for the record the Congo Conflict Minerals Act of 2009. This bill will require U.S.-registered companies Selling products using columbitetantalite. coltan. cassiterite. or wolframite. or derivatives of these minerals. to annually disclose to the Securities and Exchange Commission the country of origin of those minerals. If the country of origin is the Democratic Republic of Congo or neighboring countries. the company would need to disclose the mine of origin. These minerals are the ""conflict diamonds"" of Congo. however rather than ending up in jewelry these minerals are ending up in our electronics products. This is not the first time this issue has been raised. Only last year Senator DURBLN and I introduced S3058. the Conflict Coltan and Cassiterite Act. which prohibited the importation of certain products that contained or are derived from columbitetantalite or cassiterite mined or extracted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. While the bill did not go anywhere. the issue itself has gained attention. We have taken a strong hard look at last years bill and have done our best to improve on it. In the current legislation we call for transparency and accountability throughout the supplychain of these minerals. By making this supplychain more translucent. we ultimately can help save millions of innocent Congolese lives who find themselves caught in the middle of this conflict. a conflict based on the control of these minerals. Some in industry have already started down this road andare even in front of the curve with their efforts. but we still need to strive to do a better job of showing transparency and we need to do it quickly. It is no secret that the exploitation of minerals is taking place and funding the conflict in Congo. In its final report. released on December 12. 2008. the United Nations Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo found that official exports of columbitetantalite. cassiterite. wolframite. and gold are grossly undervalued and that various illegal armed groups in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo continue to profit greatly from these natural resources by coercively exercising control over mining sites from where they are extracted and locations along which they are transported for export. I have said this before and I will say it again. this murky. conflictfunding supplychain of minerals in eastern Congo has been the heart of darkness for that country too long and I am not the only one who believes that. Last month the Democratic Republic of Congos U.N. Ambassador Faida Mitifu spoke in New York during a panel discussion on media coverage of .sexual violence against Congolese women. When the issue of minerals in eastern Congo was raised. Ambassador Mitifu said the exploitation of mineral resources is the driving force behind the conflict. Her exact quote ""the minerals have truly been the driving force behind this war. It has been dressed with different clothes. but truly the minerals are the driving force."" She went onto say the history of exploitation and conflict dates back to the Congos colonial history with Belgium. She is right. The mismanagement of natural resources has long cast a gloom over the Democratic Republic of Congo. The exploitation of these natural resources that began during the reign of King Leopold has endured for over 100 years. During this 24year tyranny of Congo. King Leopold exploited the local population by turning it into a slave colony. extracting the resource of the dayrubber. while over 13 million Congolese died. In his book the ""Heart of Darkness"" Joseph Conrad describes King Leopolds colonial project in the Congo ""the vilest scramble for loot that ever disfigured the history of human conscience."" But have we seen history change at all? Well let me share with you some .of the lives ravaged by this ongoing conflict. This small 31/2yearold boy became one of the millions of victims of displacement and malnourishment. His family fled into the jungle from a rebel group that had burnt their village to the ground in just outside the village of Kitchanga in North Kivu. They lived in the jungle and had been constantly on the move. Food became scarce and meals became as sporadic as 2 to 3 a week. He fell sick and developed a cough: When his mother brought him to the local health clinic. they were immediately referred to an international humanitarian organization in the area. There. this young boy was diagnosed with malaria. tuberculosis. and anemia. His doctors then discovered he had been eating only what his mother could gather in jungle and ate only once every three to four days. They immediately began his treatments. which his small. frail body was struggling to accept. While this small 2yearold boy had a similar story. however more disheartening. His family had fled into the jungle when the rebels attacked their village. After 3 months of seeking shelter in the jungle. his mother finally brought him to a local health clinic where he too was referred to the international humanitarian organization there. The only diagnosis the doctors could come up with was malaria. However when this photo was taken his body was rejecting the treatments. he no longer criedout in hunger or pain. he no longer responded to anything. The issue of rape in the Congo is quite possibly the worst in the world. We used to call it a ""tool of war"" but now its not even due to the war. Because it has been taking place there for so long. it has nearly become an accepted behavior and one where impunity reigns free. Last year I spoke with Dr. Mukwege from Panzi Hospital in the city of Bukavu in the South Kivu Province of Congo. Panzi Hospital is the leading treatment hospital of rape and sexual violence survivors in Congo. Dr. Mukwege sat in my office and told me of how he was seeing as many as 10 new rape survivors who needed treatment a week. He then pulled out a map and circled the areas where majority of his patients were coming from and explained that those areas were the key mining areas for coltan and cassiterite in South Kivu. He said that rebels controlled these areas because of the mineral wealth and that with their control of these areas came their lawlessness and with lawlessness came the impunity of rape. Rape. displacement. insecurity. forced labor. child soldiers. curable illnesses left untreated. and deaths of 1.500 people a day are only a few of the human indignities directly and indirectly surrounding this struggle for control of the minerals in eastern Congo. However there is no room for turning a blind eye on this matter when we all must be actors in this supplychainfrom miner to consumer. American greatness has always been founded on our fundamental goodness. We need to be a nation where the strong protect the weak and people of privilege assist those in poverty. It says a lot about the kind of America we all should work for when we speak out against this type of tragedy and commit ourselves to those who are suffering there.",111114011,BROWNBACK,SAMUEL,S,KS,M,R,,voting,2009-04-23,813,Mr. BROWNBACK,36822,37035,04232009.txt,7205,1219,111,2009,mr presid rise today speak issu brought senat floor watch quit time would like submit record congo conflict miner act bill requir compani sell product use deriv miner annual disclos secur exchang commiss countri origin miner countri origin democrat republ congo neighbor countri compani would need disclos mine origin miner conflict diamond congo howev rather end jewelri miner end electron product first time issu rais last year senat introduc conflict act prohibit import certain product contain deriv mine extract democrat republ congo bill go anywher issu gain attent taken strong hard look last year bill done best improv current legisl call transpar account throughout miner make ultim help save million innoc congoles live find caught middl conflict conflict base control miner industri alreadi start road andar even front curv effort still need strive better job show transpar need quickli secret exploit miner take place fund conflict congo final report releas decemb unit nation group expert democrat republ congo found offici export gold grossli undervalu variou illeg arm group eastern region democrat republ congo continu profit greatli natur resourc coerciv exercis control mine site extract locat along transport export said say murki miner eastern congo heart dark countri long one believ last month democrat republ congo un ambassador spoke new york panel discuss media coverag sexual violenc congoles women issu miner eastern congo rais ambassador said exploit miner resourc drive forc behind conflict exact quot miner truli drive forc behind war dress differ cloth truli miner drive forc went onto say histori exploit conflict date back congo coloni histori belgium right mismanag natur resourc long cast gloom democrat republ congo exploit natur resourc began reign king leopold endur year year tyranni congo king leopold exploit local popul turn slave coloni extract resourc million congoles die book heart dark joseph conrad describ king leopold coloni project congo vilest scrambl loot ever disfigur histori human conscienc seen histori chang well let share live ravag ongo conflict small yearold boy becam one million victim displac malnourish famili fled jungl rebel group burnt villag ground outsid villag north kivu live jungl constantli move food becam scarc meal becam sporad week fell sick develop cough mother brought local health clinic immedi refer intern humanitarian organ area young boy diagnos malaria tuberculosi anemia doctor discov eat mother could gather jungl ate everi three four day immedi began treatment small frail bodi struggl accept small yearold boy similar stori howev dishearten famili fled jungl rebel attack villag month seek shelter jungl mother final brought local health clinic refer intern humanitarian organ diagnosi doctor could come malaria howev photo taken bodi reject treatment longer hunger pain longer respond anyth issu rape congo quit possibl worst world use call tool war even due war take place long nearli becom accept behavior one impun reign free last year spoke dr hospit citi south kivu provinc congo hospit lead treatment hospit rape sexual violenc survivor congo dr sat offic told see mani new rape survivor need treatment week pull map circl area major patient come explain area key mine area south kivu said rebel control area miner wealth control area came lawless lawless came impun rape rape displac insecur forc labor child soldier curabl ill left untreat death peopl day human indign directli indirectli surround struggl control miner eastern congo howev room turn blind eye matter must actor miner consum american great alway found fundament good need nation strong protect weak peopl privileg assist poverti say lot kind america work speak type tragedi commit suffer,615,FALSE

It is only 7:36 back home in Oregon. but for you gentlemen. it is the end of a long dayor you are probably going back to your offices. And being willing to be part of this discussion tonight and the work that you are doing in the committees and providing the leadership. for me it is inspirational. and I deeply appreciate it. I appreciate your focusing in on the economic benefits. even putting aside the problems that we are facing as a result of global warming. but the opportunities to help families reduce their utility bills. to live more comfortably. to create not just -thousands of jobs or tens of thousands of jobs. we are talking literally about millions of jobs. And already. as you pointed out this evening. we are seeing the glimmer of what can happen as a result of the economic recovery package. We are seeing that there are all sorts of advantages from simply moving forward apart from that. in terms of the cost savings. given the fact that energy costs are going to be going back up in the foreseeable future without question. And last. but not least. the cost of inaction dwarfs the cost of action. The downside risk is truly chilling. We are seeing that mount. We have seen study after study that shows that the American economy risks losing trillions of dollars of productivity. And the relatively small amount that we would be investing to forestall disaster seems like a bargain. I appreciate your willingness to join with us this evening. I hope that we will be able to continue this discussion. not just in our committees. but here on the floor. to be able to put the bigger picture together.

Were all talking about how We can improve our economy. address our energy crisis. address our environmental crisis. but at the same time. we need to bear in mind that this is the way we draw attention to this Nation and her intellectual capacity. where we become the exporter of energy thinking. of energy ideas. of innovation. This is the strengthening of the economy. As people invest in this economy. in the American knowhow. we then become even stronger as we develop the solutions for our air that we breathe. the water that we drink. and certainly the soil that we utilize for our own opportunities and routine opportunities throughout life. We can then become this goto nation. which is as critical today. if not more critical. than the space race was in the Sixties. which we won because we committed to thinking in new terms. in bolder terms.

1110041930,I appreciate your comments. Were already seeingsome of the effects in our oil and gas energy sector in the State of Oklahoma of job losses already just by talking- about the capandtrade piece of .egislation. And you were mentioning a few moments ago about the pollution of other countries and how if we have cap and trade here and we try to control our emissionswhich we should. we should have reasonable policy on thathow China and India and some of those other growing economies will still keep polluting. In fact. a statistic that I saw said twothirds of the worlds population comes from countries other than the United States. So. while we may put some heavy restrictionsr that could cost jobs and investment in the United States. these other countries will take those market shares from us and continue polluting. I was interested in your comments by Secretary Geithner who said we have an overproduction of our oil. which that is an unusual comment when our Nation is so dependent upon foreign energy. I think many of us in .this body believe that our country is at risk in our national security and economic security by buying almost 70 percent65. 70 percent of our energy supplies from other foreign countries while spending around $700 billion buying that foreign energy. Just think what that $700 billionif we pioduced our own energywhat that would do in our Nation as it relates to jobs and investment in our marketplace here in the United States.. But yet we continue to send that money to foreign countries buying their energy versus encouraging innovation. free enterprise here in United States of all kinds of energy sources. And I just truly believe we have the knowledge. we have the capacity and the intellect in the United States to develop these alternative means of fuel and to reduce our carbon emissions. Look at natural gas. There is a proposal here in Congress to encourage more investment in C&G cars. more infrastructure investment In hatural gas. And I hope that we continue to push those kinds of policies rather than massive ta increases and standards that will actually hurt our national economy and hurt our jobs.,111115580,FALLIN,MARY,H,OK,F,R,5,voting,2009-05-19,229,Ms. FALLIN,16603,16662,05192009.txt,2145,367,111,2009,appreci comment alreadi effect oil ga energi sector state oklahoma job loss alreadi talk capandtrad piec egisl mention moment ago pollut countri cap trade tri control reason polici thathow china india grow economi still keep pollut fact statist saw said twothird world popul come countri unit state may put heavi could cost job invest unit state countri take market share us continu pollut interest comment secretari geithner said overproduct oil unusu comment nation depend upon foreign energi think mani us bodi believ countri risk nation secur econom secur buy almost percent percent energi suppli foreign countri spend around billion buy foreign energi think billionif would nation relat job invest marketplac unit state yet continu send money foreign countri buy energi versu encourag innov free enterpris unit state kind energi sourc truli believ knowledg capac intellect unit state develop altern mean fuel reduc carbon emiss look natur ga propos congress encourag invest cg car infrastructur invest hatur ga hope continu push kind polici rather massiv ta increas standard actual hurt nation economi hurt job,178,TRUE
1110000336,"Mr. President. I rise today to introduce legislation that will help address the threats to public health and safety caused by abandoned hardrock mines. There are as many as 500.000 abandoned mines strewn across the western states47.000 alone are found on Californias public lands. The scope of this problem is huge. In the past two years. eight accidents at abandoned mine sites were reported in California. Throughout the United States. at least 37 deaths occurred between 1999 and 2007 and the potential for more is ominous. Basic remediation efforts. such as warning signs and fencing. can provide protection. However. some abandoned mines pose a more serious threat. Environmental impact studies have shown that important watersheds are being polluted by high levels of harmful minerals. such as mercury. lead. arsenic and asbestos. In California alone. seventeen watersheds have been affected. Yet not enough is being done to clean up these dangerous Gold Rushera mines. The bill that I am introducing today is not intended to be a comprehensive hardrock mining bill. but it is an important piece of the reform needed. The Abandoned Mine Reclamation Act of 2009 will reform the 1872 Mining Law by establishing fees to support abandoned mine clean up. establishing a royalty payment system. and creating an Abandoned Mine Clean up Fund. Unlike the coal industry. the metal mining industry does not pay to clean up its legacy of abandoned mines. making lack of funding the primary obstacle to abandoned hardrock mine clean up. This legislation would help fund the clean up of abandoned mines by placing an Abandoned Mine Reclamation fee on all hardrock minerals. using the underground coal industry fee program as a model. Specifically. it would create a 0.3 percent reclamation fee on the gross value of all hardrock mineral mining. including mining on Federal. State. tribal. local and private lands. The condition of abandoned coal mines has greatly improved since the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 established a fee to finance restoration of land abandoned or inadequately restored by coal mining companies. This fund has been able to raise billions of dollars for coal mine reclamationand I believe that a similar program could be part of the solution to hardrock abandoned mine clean up. This legislation establishes a royalty fee on Hardrock Mining Claims. Companies that mine for gold and silver on Federal lands are not currently required to pay any royalties to the Federal Governmenteven though we are experiencing near record high gold prices. These companies should be required to pay their fair share. The Abandoned Mine Reclamation Act establishes an 8 percent royalty on new mining operations located on Federal lands. and a 4 percent royalty for existing operations. The legislation I am introducing today also creates an Abandoned Mine Fund. In these times of budget deficits. its clear that we will not be able to simply appropriate the funds necessary to clean up the hundreds of thousands of abandoned hard rock mines. So. this legislation will create an abandoned mine clean up fund to ensure that we have a lasting source of funding for this critical clean up effort. Specifically. the fund will direct the royalties. as well as other payments collected from mining operations. and dedicate them to the clean up of abandoned hardrock mines. I recognize the important role that mining has played in Californias history. The discovery of gold at Sutter Mill near Placerville. California in 1848 was a defining moment for my State and the U.S. It is fair to say that without mining and the Gold Rush. California and the entire country would be a far different place than it is today. The history of mining in California. however. is tarnished by the legacy of tens of thousands of abandoned mines. In particular. abandoned mine sites on Federal lands. A recent report from the Department of the Interiors Inspector General underscores the scope and the urgency of the abandoned mine problem on public landsin particular. those managed by the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service. The report concluded that public health and safety have been compromised by mismanagement. funding shortfalls and systematic neglect. The report found the potential for more deaths and injuries is ominous. A number of abandoned mine sites on public lands present an immediate danger due to open shafts. collapsing mine walls. and rotting structures. Some have deadly gases that accumulate in underground passages. And others leach hazardous chemicals like arsenic. lead and mercury into groundwater. The Bureau of Land Managements abandoned mines program has been neglected and understaffed. In some cases. staff were told by their supervisors to ignore these problems. and those who did come forward to identify contaminated sites were criticized or outright threatened. The scope of the problem is less severe at the National Parks Service. But perennial funding shortfalls impede the clean up of known abandoned mines. At the heart of the problem is a Centuryold law signed by President Ulysses S. Grant to promote the settlement of publiclyowned lands in the western states. The 1872 Mining Law created national standards for hardrock mining operations on Federal public lands. however. it has not been substantially updated for 137 years. Under this outdated framework. the hardrock mining industry does not pay royalties for minerals taken from Federal land and is not obligated to share in the cost of clean up for abandoned mines. Since the enactment of this law. hundreds of thousands- of mines have been abandoned. Congress needs to move swiftly to address this issue before more damage and accidents occur. Though this legislation is a significant step forward for the funding of abandoned mines. I know that there is much more mining reform to be done. I look forward to working with my colleagues to modernize our Nations mining laws and accelerate the clean up of dangerous abandoned mines. "" Mr. President.

1110056235,"Madam Speaker. I rise in opposition to H.R. 2454. the socalled American Clean Energy and Security Act. Throughout my time in Congress I have supported protecting Americas environment and climate as well as incentives for clean alternative. energy. including solar. wind. and biofuels. It is in our countys best interest environmentally. economically. and for our national security to transition away from imported oil to domestically available. renewable. and clean sources of alternative energy. For instance. I have supported efforts by the City of St. Petersburg to power 40 of the citys parks entirely using a sustainable solar energy hetwork which will allow these parks to be removed from the citys power grid. In the 110th Congress I was a cosponsor of the Clean Energy Tax Stimulus Act of 2008. This measure would have provided for the continuation of eight clean energy production and efficiency tax benefits in order to incentivize important alternative energy investment and production. I am also supportive of initiatives to require auto manufacturers to increase the fuel efficiency of the cars sold in America. In fact. in March I signed a letter to President Obama to urge him to take the strongest stand possible to increase the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards. Last Congress I was a cosponsor of the Fuel Economy Reform Act which would have raised CAFE standards to 35 miles per gallon over the next decade. And I have long been supportive of protecting Floridas environment and our militarys training needs by opposing offshore drilling in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. I also believe in creating. and supporting new green jobs. At the same time that we encourage conservation and the production of renewable resources. we must also help prepare Americans to work in these new green jobs. That is why I voted in favor of the Green Energy Education Act.. This legislation would authorize funds to be made available to support advanced energy and green building training and graduate programs throughout the country. Despite my support for clean energy and a clean environment. I must oppose this cap and trade legislation which will impose increased costs on American citizens who have done nothing wrong. At a time when the people of Pinellas County and our nation are hurting. it is incomprehensible that the House will knowingly approve legislation that will impose a new energy tax on American citizens. will put American companies at a competitive disadvantage. and will endanger the jobs of American workers. Supporters of this legislation have tried to claim that the cap and trade scheme will only cost some negligible amount. a postage stamp per day or $15 per month. They claim that a report by the Congressional Budget Office backs up this statement. However. if you actu-. ally take the time to read the CBOs report. you will understand that this is simply not true. The analysis only includes one limited portion of the 1.201 page bill. The analysis does not include the effects from the lower incomes and lost jobs that the CBO predicts will occur. The analysis does not include the effects from the decreased retirement accounts that will be realized as the value of stocks decline. as the CBO predicts. The analysis does not include the increased costs of producing goods in the United States. as the CBO predicts..In short. to say that this legislation will not hurt American families is simply misleading. H7660. CO If this. legislation is signed into .law. energy costs are going to rise.-Even the President acknowledges tha.tp~jltricity rates are going to ""necessarily skyrocket."" Britains Taxpayer Alliance estimates that families there are paying $1.300 more in taxes after the implementation of a similar program only a few short years ago. In drafting this legislation. -proposals were offered to suspend the cap and trade program if gas prices rose above $5 per gallon. if electricity prices rose by 10 percent. or if the unemployment rate hits an unthinkable 15 percent. All three of these sensible ideas were voted down by supporters of this bill. All Americans will be impacted by these higher energy prices. but the hardest hit will be the low income and the many of my constituents are seniors who live on fixed incomes. I do not think that I need to remind any of my colleagues of the energy crisis of last summer. I remember all to well the stories from my constituents of the difficulty they had in dealing with $4 per gallon gasoline. However. a study conducted by the American Petroleum Institute has found that the impact from this legislation will add an additional 77 cents to the price of a gallon of gasoline. and even higher costs for critical diesel fuel. In the last two years alone more than 5.000 trucking companies with at least five trucks went out of business. costing a countless number of jobs. Is this really the type of result we want? Inexplicably. this legislation would spend seven percent of the cap and trade allowancespaid for by American consumersin foreign countries. Let me repeat that: this bill will send $302 billion U.S. tax dollars under cap and trade to.foreign countries. Most of this money is set aside to plant trees. The Congressional Budget Office has said that ""the allowances spent overseas would impose a net cost 6n U.S. households: They would bear the cost of the allowances but would not receive the value."" The cap and trade scheme also creates a new tradable commodity that Wall Street investors will be able to buy and manipulate. The pollution allowances will be traded and sold on the open market to the highest bidder. Companies who will be forced to buy these to provide necessary energy and products will pass on these costs to consumers. Even worse. this bill sets a minimum price for which the allowances can be sold for. not a maximum price to prevent the fleecing of American consumers. After the financial collapse of last year. we should not allow W#ll Street speculators and commodity traders to hold the American people hostage in this way. I thought the purpose of this legislation was to protect the environment. not to help Wall Street get richer. Also included in this bill is a onesizefitsall nationwide renewable energy standard that favors certain regions of the country at the expense of others. It is estimated that residents in Florida will be forced to pay an additional $339 million in their energy bills within only a few years. while the residents of some states in the northeast and.the west coast will be: heavily subsidized. Fundamentally. I believe that the federal govemment must get out of the business of picking winners and losers. These are just some of the things that we actually know are in the bill.

Clearly. the entire Nation is feeling a financial meltdown with home foreclosures and many other challenges we face. but in California. beyond that. we have a drought that also involves a dairy meltdown. We have reservoirs that are low. Federal allocations that are set at zero in the San Joaquin Valley. which I represent. along with many of my colleagues. 20 percent for State water deliveries. As a result. we could lose as many as 80.000 jobs. The economic impact could be as much as $2.2 billion in the San Joaquin Valley that we represent. Small communities have been -crippled. Communities that. I represent like Mendota and Firebaugh have 36 to 40 percent unemployment. Delano. with over 50.000 people. has over 34 percent unemployment. Naming a drought task force is helpful but it is not enough. Plain and simple. we dont need words. we need water.

1110025717,"Mr. Chairman. I yield to myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. I am offering an amendment to the FLAME Act to amend the definition of ""fireready community."" The overall bill is of great concern to my district. where 6 million acres of natigoal forest provide access to unique natural resources. but also pose a great risk of fire. We are just a few short weeks from the official beginning of wildfire season in the State of Arizona. In fact. there was a report in the Prescott Daily Courier yesterday of a start of awildfire in the Skull Valley area. For the next 6 months. more than 7.000 professional firefighters and countless volunteers will be on constant alert. We have already begun fighting fires just miles from the site of the RodeoChediski fire that devastated Arizonas First District 7 years ago. And we expect to be tested throughout the district very soon. The drought that has been ravaging Arizona for many years makes us even more vulnerable to wildfires than we once were. Just last year. in Yavapai County. which is in my district. we lost almost 9.000 acres and nearly lost the historic community of Crown King when a hiker started a small signal fire. And that was just one of the 1.850 wildfires that ranged over our State. burning 85.000 acres. And that was a mild wildfire season. Our firefighters have bravely contained fires year in and year out doing outstanding work to keep our citizens safe. They have risked their lives combating wildfires in Arizona and across the country. With some of the best training in the world available at the Wildfire Academy in Prescott. which was started with the efforts of my cousin. Cory Kirkpatrick. I have no doubt they will come into this wildfire season as well prepared as ever to protect our homes and communities. But with the millions of acres of national forest for them to protect in the First District of Arizona alone and the State Forestry Division responsible for more than 22 million acres. bravery and readiness may not be enough. They need our assistance to partner with local communities for the implementation of a community wildfire protection plan. along with a provision for training. education and equipment. That is why I have offered this amendment. which changes the definition of ""fire -ready community."" the cities and towns that will receive Firefighting Capability Grants. Under my amendment. cities that have taken goodfaith steps to prepare for wildfire and are in regions considered high priority will be eligible for these grants. With so much at stake. we should be making it easier for towns to receive the help they need to prepare and protect against devastating wildfires. To that end. I urge support of my amendment. .

1110056069,Madam Speaker. I rise in opposition to this legislation. I rise in defense of the Midwest and the -State of Indiana to oppose this carbon cap and tax bill. This is the most economically disastrous energy policy our nation has ever considered. Its over 1200 pages and full of last minute changes! This is not the way. or the time. to consider a rushed policy that will devastate our economy. The American people deserve more from their Representatives than a bill of empty promises that will send their jobs overseas. raise the cost of living. and increase our dependence on energy from.foreign countries. Over the past few years. I have participated in multiple hearings concerning carbon dioxide emission control. During the markup of H.R. 2454 by the Energy and Commerce Committee. I. along with my colleagues. continued to raise concerns about this policys negative effects on American ratepayers. businesses and industry. Importantly. we offered many amendments in the markup we would like to consider on the Floor today. but we have been denied the opportunity. We would have added nuclear energythe cleanest and most effi-. cient energy generationbut were denied. Other amendments would have offered offramps should this legislation prove too costly to the Apierican people. Unfortunately. no significant changes providing offramps or safetyvalves have been offered to the American people. and our concerns have not been addressed. H.R. 2454 would hand down the single biggest energy tax in the history of our country. Now is not the time! The unemployment rate is at the highest we have seen in over 25 years. Our automotive industry is just beginning new business plans. This week we are selling off more of our national debt to foreign countries. and next month we are considering a national healthcare plan projected to cost $3.4 trillion! It is not the time to pass a policy that will result in an annual additional cost of $1.241 more in energy costs for a family of four. It is not the time to pass a policy that will drive up the price of goods and services. or export our hardearned jobs to countries like China. This legislation will kill jobs. Lets talk numbers. An estimated 1.145.000 will be lost under cap and trade. There is a whole section dedicated to unemployment with a price tag to the taxpayer of over a billion dollars! Farmers will also suffer. This act would lower farm profits by 28: percent in 2012 alone. and 57 percent from 20122035. Projections show this would result in total gross domestic product losses averaging $383 billion annually from 20122035 and cost our country a total of $9.4 trillion dollars. Where will that money come from? Well. under this proposal. the Midwest. for one. This .cap and tax bill unfairly targets the heartland of our nation. Indiana is the sixth highest carbon dioxide emitting state in the nation. As a state reliant on coal for 96 percent of its electricity. Indiana would be unfairly burdened by the current legislative proposal for producing Americanmade goods .with Americanmade energy. What kind of energy policy is that? Under the current language. permits are allocated to utilities using a basis of 50 percent of their emissions and 50 percent of their retail salesproviding utilities without emissions access to allowances. Sending allowances to those that do not require them does not benefit the people or states that need them most. I offered an amendment in Rules to correct this bad policy. My amendment would have modified the utility allocation formula to being strictly based on 100% of a utilitys emissions. It is common sense: the utilities reliant on the costlier fuel should be the ones receiving the help. We shouldnt be handing out allowances to those who do not need them! Under the current formula. utilities of similar size in California would get 2.43 times the allowances of an Indiana utilityand a Washington utility would receive 8.84 times the allowances of a utility in Indiana! That is not acceptable! Under the current bill. our rates will rise by a projected 90 percent by 2035. driving our manufacturing jobs elsewhere and the costs of goods sky high. The State of Indiana has worked hard over the past several years to bring new jobs and industries to Hoosiers. This bill could undo all the progress we have made. Unfortunately. my amendment was denied by the Rules Committee. I call upon my colleagues to see this is not the time for this bill. An energy tax anticipated to slow temperature increases by merely hundredths of a single degree Fahrenheit by 2050 is not good policy.

NADC. in Ames. IA. NADC is a world class research facility that provides vital research to identify emerging animal diseases and develop effective methods to prevent and treat emerging threats to animal agriculture. our food supply and human health. Over the past few years we have seen the emergence of a number of threats to the livestock industry in the United States such as the avian influenza and HINI virus. Not only do these diseases pose a threat to animal health. but they also represent a threat to human health. Work at NADC is vitally important to protecting animal and human health and improving the lives of millions of people worldwide. Additional resources provided in this bill for ongoing research at NADC on emerging animal disease are vital to the livestock industry. In the early days of the HINI outbreak misinformation cost pork producers in the United States an estimated $7.2 million a day. even though HINI was never found in pigs in the United States. Developing additional capacity for vaccine discovery and rapid detection of emerging animal disease is important in protecting human health and animal agriculture.

1110044503,Mr. President. I rise today with my colleague Senator LINCOLN to introduce the Nurse Faculty and Physical Therapist Education Act of 2009. This legislation will help to address the critical shortage of nurse faculty and physical therapists that is facing our Nation. The nationwide nursing shortage is growing rapidly. because the average age of the nursing workforce is near retirement and because the aging population has increased health care needs. The shortage is one that affects the entire Nation. A 2006 Health Resources and Services Administration. HRSA. report estimated that the national nursing shortage would more than triple. to more than one million nurses. by the year 2020. The report also predicts that all 50 States will experience nursing shortages by 2015. Quite simply. we need to educate more nurses. or we. as a Nation. will not have enough trained nurses to meet the needs of our aging society. One of the biggest constraints to educating more nurses is a shortage of nursing faculty. Almost threequarters of nursing programs surveyed by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing cited faculty shortages as a reason for turning away qualified applicants. Although applications to nursing programs have surged 59 percent over the past decade. the National League for Nursing estimates that 147.000 qualified applications were turned away in 2004. This represents a 27 percent decrease in admissions over the previous year. indicating the need to scale up capacity in nursing programs is more critical than ever. I know that in my home State of New Mexico. nursing programs turned down almost half of qualified applicants. even though HRSA predicts that New Mexico will only be able to meet 64 percent of its demand for nurses by 2020. With a national nurse faculty workforce that averages 53.5 years of age. and an average nurse faculty retirement age of 62.5 years. we cannot and must not wait any longer to address nurse faculty shortages. Nursing faculty are not the only segment of the population that is aging. As the baby boom generation ages. there will be an increased need for nurses to care for the elderly. However. less than one percent of practicing nurses have a certification in geriatrics. The Nurse Faculty and Physical Therapist Education Act will amend the Public Health Service Act. to help alleviate the faculty shortage by providing funds to help nursing schools increase enrollment and graduation from nursing doctoral programs. The act will increase partnering opportunities between academic institutions and medical practices. enhance cooperative education. support marketing outreach. and strengthen mentoring programs. The bill will increase the number of nurses who complete nursing doctoral programs and seek employment as faculty members and nursing leaders in academic institutions. In addition. the bill authorizes awards to train nursing faculty in clinical geriatrics. so that more nursing students will be equipped for our aging population. By addressing the faculty shortage. we are addressing the nursing shortage. The aging population will also require additional health workers in other fields. Physical therapy was listed as one of the fastest growing occupations by the U.S. Department of Labor. with a projected jdb growth of greater than -36 percent between 2004 and 2014. The need for physical therapists is particularly acute in rural and urban underserved areas. which have three to four times fewer physical therapists per capita than suburban areas. To address this n6ed. the bill also authorizes a distance education pilot program to improve access to educational opportunity for both nursing and physical therapy students. Finally. the bill calls for a study by the Institute of Medicine at the National Academy of Sciences which will recommend how to balance education. labor. and immigration policies to meet the demand for qualified nurses and physical therapists. The provisions of the Nurse Faculty and Physical Therapist Education Act are vital to overcoming workforce challenges. By addressing nurse faculty and physical therapist shortages. we will enhance both access to care and the quality of care. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.,111116421,BINGAMAN,JEFF,S,NM,M,D,,voting,2009-06-02,115,Mr. BINGAMAN,8380,8502,06022009.txt,4280,674,111,2009,mr presid rise today colleagu senat lincoln introduc nurs faculti physic therapist educ act legisl help address critic shortag nurs faculti physic therapist face nation nationwid nurs shortag grow rapidli averag age nurs workforc near retir age popul increas health care need shortag one affect entir nation health resourc servic administr hrsa report estim nation nurs shortag would tripl one million nurs year report also predict state experi nurs shortag quit simpli need educ nurs nation enough train nurs meet need age societi one biggest constraint educ nurs shortag nurs faculti almost threequart nurs program survey american associ colleg nurs cite faculti shortag reason turn away qualifi applic although applic nurs program surg percent past decad nation leagu nurs estim qualifi applic turn away repres percent decreas admiss previou year indic need scale capac nurs program critic ever know home state new mexico nurs program turn almost half qualifi applic even though hrsa predict new mexico abl meet percent demand nurs nation nurs faculti workforc averag year age averag nurs faculti retir age year must wait longer address nurs faculti shortag nurs faculti segment popul age babi boom gener age increas need nurs care elderli howev less one percent practic nurs certif geriatr nurs faculti physic therapist educ act amend public health servic act help allevi faculti shortag provid fund help nurs school increas enrol graduat nurs doctor program act increas partner opportun academ institut medic practic enhanc cooper educ support market outreach strengthen mentor program bill increas number nurs complet nurs doctor program seek employ faculti member nurs leader academ institut addit bill author award train nurs faculti clinic geriatr nurs student equip age popul address faculti shortag address nurs shortag age popul also requir addit health worker field physic therapi list one fastest grow occup us depart labor project jdb growth greater percent need physic therapist particularli acut rural urban underserv area three four time fewer physic therapist per capita suburban area address ned bill also author distanc educ pilot program improv access educ opportun nurs physic therapi student final bill call studi institut medicin nation academi scienc recommend balanc educ labor immigr polici meet demand qualifi nurs physic therapist provis nurs faculti physic therapist educ act vital overcom workforc challeng address nurs faculti physic therapist shortag enhanc access care qualiti care mr presid ask unanim consent text bill print record,393,FALSE
1110072542,Right. Some were shipped off into a foreign economy. Others simply evaporated. And we saw in record numbers the losses that were out there because they simply could not compete and stay effective. I meet people every day in my district. and I represent a capital region in New York State so that we have the benefit. the buffer. of public sector jobs. But our unemployment numbers are hanging near in excess of 9 percent. This is unacceptable. We need to do much more work as we go forward. And we applaud the efforts to date to take that surplus and apply it as a downpayment. But thats as its seen. as a downpayment. There are many more installments to come in order for us to build hope in the lives of people. and thats what its about. You hear it. Weve talked about it. I hear it in my district. The fear with which people speak. the uncertainty of their tomorrow. the need for us to provide jobs for the youngest in society who are being released from higher ed who are in search of employment. Those who have been chronically unemployed. as you point out. before this recession hit and as it hit. chronic unemployment in many of our neighborhoods. All of this has to be taken into a fullpicture view and create those situations that allow us to be competitive. And I think we can do it. For instance. in the energyrelated areas. we can grow jobs of the green collar variety. We can reduce demand for energy in this country. Were the most gluttonous society as it comes to use of our energy supplies. We send hundreds of billions of dollars into the treasuries of unfriendly nations. those who inspire terrorist activities in our country and around the world. Were sending hundreds of billions of dollars there. And do you think we could move forward with an energy security agenda. growing our energy independence. providing for energy audits. creating energy teams that can go into neighborhoods. allowing jobs for those who have been chronically unemployed or those recently unemployed. training. retraining programs through our community colleges to advance those energy audits and then to do the implementation of the audits as theyre developed? These are great jobs that reduce our demand of energy through an energy efficiency program. allow us to create American jobs as we generate our supplies locally through embracing our intellectual capacity as a Nation. inspiring investments in R&D. research and development. and that will also deploy these ideas that are coming from public and private sector R&D centers. put those into working capacity for our Nations people.

1110016542,Mr. President. I rise today in support of H.R. 1105. the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009. This is a measure that should have been completed last year but was not because of the previous administrations unwillingness to negotiate in good faith. But today we have the opportunity to put partisanship behind us and to continue the task of rebuilding our economy. reinvesting in America and. frankly. making our Government work again. I want to point out that today is March 2. We are now almost halfway through the fiscal year. Except for Defense. Veterans. and Homeland Security. our executive branch agencies are all still operating on a continuing resolution. Under the continuing resolution. no new programs can begin. Funding levels are held to last years level. This means that even things such as price increases due to inflation and the cost of civil servant pay raises must be absorbed within the existing agency funding levels. Many worthy initiatives which were approved by the Appropriations Committee are being held at artificially low spending totals. And. as we all know. the continuing resolution will expire on Fridaythis Friday. It is not in the best interes.ts of the taxpayer or the agencies we are funding to operate the Federal Government on autopilot. A yearlong continuing resolution does not allow a Federal agency any flexibility to address changing priorities. Passage of H.R. 1105 begins the process of returning our Departments and agencies to a more regular order. We simply must complete this bill this weekin fact. this Thursday. The 2009 omnibus bill has strong support from both sides of the aisle. including the vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee. Senator THAD COCHRAN. Further. the distinguished minority leader was accurate with his comments in January that this bill has been fully vetted and is ready for immediate passage. This measure is not. as some have suggested. duplicative of the spending provided by the recently enacted American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. This argument misses the point entirely. The purpose of the recovery package is to jumpstart economic growth by making significant investments above the annual budget. The omnibus is the baseline budget. But equally important to the funding contained in the bill is the fact that the omnibus bill will provide much needed guidance to executive branch agencies that have been operating without such guidance under the continuing resolution. In addition. there are a number of new initiatives across the Government that cannot be implemented without passage of this bill. So it is my sincere hope this is the last omnibus bill we will see for some time to come. as it is my intention as chairman of the Appropriations Committee to pass each of our annual appropriations measures through the regular order. But having said that. it is clearly impossible for fiscal year 2009. and for all the reasons mentioned above. there is no doubt that this bill is far superior to yet another continuing resolution. The $410 billion in spending contained in this measure will accomplish a number of objectives. including giving extra momentum to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. by funding additional projects and. therefore. saving thousands of additional jobs. In this time of economic crisis. nothing is more important than keeping America working. I will offer a few examples of the kinds of initiatives that I included in this 2009 omnibus. Energy security: There is perhaps no issue more critical to the future safety and prosperity of our Nation than energy security. This omnibus bill invests in Americas security by prioritizing research and development of renewable energy and energy efficiency. including solar power. biofuels. vehicle technologies. energyefficient buildings. and advanced energy research. Law enforcement: In the absence of strong support for law enforcement. the current economic downturn threatens to increase violent crime throughout our Nation. As cashstrapped States struggle with tight budgets. this bill will help keep Americans safe by supporting the Community Oriented Policing Services or the COPS Program. and the Byrne Justice Assistance Grants. which help State and local law enforcement fight and prevent crime in communities across America. Public health and safety: In the wake of disturbing incidents of compromised food safety that have jeopardized the health of our citizens. we have significantly increased investments for the Food and Drug Administration to strengthen the Food Safety and Inspection efforts. This bill will also protect the health and wellbeing of Americans by cleaning our air and our water. It contains investments significantly above the former administrations inadequate request for clean drinking water and wastewater. cleaning up hazardous waste and toxic sites. and for the implementation of the Clean Air Act. Health care: Millions of Americans are struggling to gain access to quality affordable health care. particularly during these difficult economic times. This measure will give scores of Americans better access to health care through State access health grants and State highrisk insurance pools and by supporting community health centers and rural health facilities. Education: As our economy struggles to regain its footing. millions of Americans are understandably fearful they will not be able to afford to pay for their childrens college education. This measure provides $1.9 billion to support student financial aid programs. including Perkins loans and Federal supplemental educational opportunity grants. Every day. thousands of Americans are losing their jobsevery day. Every day. State and local governments see increased demand and decreased resources. Every day. projects that could provide good jobs for working Americans are delayed or canceled due to an inability to properly fund them. This Omnibus appropriations act will provide resources. guidance. and new initiatives at a time when they are desperately needed. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the passage of this measure. Mr. President. I have two documents. one relating to reasons why this omnibus bill should be enacted and the other a copy of a press release made a few weeks ago. I ask unanimous consent that these two documents be printed in the RECORD.,111116401,INOUYE,DANIEL,S,HI,M,D,,voting,2009-03-02,92,Mr. INOUYE,2844,3032,03022009.txt,6343,995,111,2009,mr presid rise today support hr omnibu appropri act measur complet last year previou administr unwilling negoti good faith today opportun put partisanship behind us continu task rebuild economi reinvest america frankli make govern work want point today march almost halfway fiscal year except defens veteran homeland secur execut branch agenc still oper continu resolut continu resolut new program begin fund level held last year level mean even thing price increas due inflat cost civil servant pay rais must absorb within exist agenc fund level mani worthi initi approv appropri committe held artifici low spend total know continu resolut expir friday best interest taxpay agenc fund oper feder govern autopilot yearlong continu resolut allow feder agenc flexibl address chang prioriti passag hr begin process return depart agenc regular order simpli must complet bill weekin fact thursday omnibu bill strong support side aisl includ vice chairman appropri committe senat thad cochran distinguish minor leader accur comment januari bill fulli vet readi immedi passag measur suggest duplic spend provid recent enact american recoveri reinvest act argument miss point entir purpos recoveri packag jumpstart econom growth make signific invest annual budget omnibu baselin budget equal import fund contain bill fact omnibu bill provid much need guidanc execut branch agenc oper without guidanc continu resolut addit number new initi across govern implement without passag bill sincer hope last omnibu bill see time come intent chairman appropri committe pass annual appropri measur regular order said clearli imposs fiscal year reason mention doubt bill far superior yet anoth continu resolut billion spend contain measur accomplish number object includ give extra momentum american recoveri reinvest act fund addit project therefor save thousand addit job time econom crisi noth import keep america work offer exampl kind initi includ omnibu energi secur perhap issu critic futur safeti prosper nation energi secur omnibu bill invest america secur priorit research develop renew energi energi effici includ solar power biofuel vehicl technolog energyeffici build advanc energi research law enforc absenc strong support law enforc current econom downturn threaten increas violent crime throughout nation cashstrap state struggl tight budget bill help keep american safe support commun orient polic servic cop program byrn justic assist grant help state local law enforc fight prevent crime commun across america public health safeti wake disturb incid compromis food safeti jeopard health citizen significantli increas invest food drug administr strengthen food safeti inspect effort bill also protect health wellb american clean air water contain invest significantli former administr inadequ request clean drink water wastewat clean hazard wast toxic site implement clean air act health care million american struggl gain access qualiti afford health care particularli difficult econom time measur give score american better access health care state access health grant state highrisk insur pool support commun health center rural health facil educ economi struggl regain foot million american understand fear abl afford pay children colleg educ measur provid billion support student financi aid program includ perkin loan feder supplement educ opportun grant everi day thousand american lose day everi day state local govern see increas demand decreas resourc everi day project could provid good job work american delay cancel due inabl properli fund omnibu appropri act provid resourc guidanc new initi time desper need urg colleagu join support passag measur mr presid two document one relat reason omnibu bill enact copi press releas made week ago ask unanim consent two document print record,567,TRUE

1110023941,Mr. Speaker. the government answer to governmentcreated problems is to tax people and businesses that are producing. The economic philosophy is simple: Punish success by the power of the tax. The latest government tax plan is the energy tax. The idea is. tax anything that uses energy. And it contains several philosophies. The first one is raise the gasoline tax 10 cents. I guess the government bureaucrats dont think gasoline prices are high enough already. Americans pay 18 cents in Federal gasoline tax. about 20 cents in State tax. and gasoline is approaching $2 a gallon. so they are going to raise taxes and make it harder for us to drive. But that is not all. The idea also is to tax mileage of cars. It is called the car user tax. In other words. for every mile an American citizen drives. they are going to get taxed for that mile. Of course. that hurts people in rural areas. it hurts people who dont have mass transit and dont have a choochoo train to ride to work. But it is the car user tax. and we dont know yet how much that is going to be. But we have more. The idea also is to tax the use of energy in your home. In other words. when you turn on the lights. you are using electricity and you are going to get taxed for using that energy. If you have hot water in your home and you use a hot water heater that is run by natural gas and you turn on the hot water. since you are using natural gas you are going to get taxed again for the use of energy. And of course in the winter in some places in the United States they use home heating oil to keep warm in the winter. And since they are using energy. they are going to get taxed for that. It is the home use energy tax on all Americans. And of course the same is going to be applied to businesses. But businesses. they are going to pass their taxes on down to the consumer who has to pay all of those taxes as well. There is more. There is the capandtrade tax. or the cap tax as I call it. What that is. it is based on the unproven mythical theory of global warming and the use of C02. so if you use any C02. you are going to get taxed for that. There are other taxes. Those include taxes on energy production. What that is. is those businesseswe call them oil companiesthat produce energy for the rest of us to use. they are going to be taxed with so many different taxes I dont have time to go through it. but what it amounts to. it will cost the American consumer another 41 cents per gallon of gasoline to pay for that tax on energy production that is being passed from the oil companies down to the American consumer. And. of course. the effect of that. whether intended or unintended. will be to send those energyproducing companies. those oil companies. somewhere else. We already find out that some of them are moving to Switzerland. When that happens. we will get less tax revenue to begin with. You see. we already have the second highest corporate income tax in the World. And why would we fault oil companies for moving overseas when they are already paying so much taxes? And these energy taxes will increase and encourage people to move offshore and to other places. Mr. Speaker. whether people know it or not. we do not have alternatives for the use of crude oil or gasoline yet. Some day we might have one of those electric cars that we all get to drive around in. but we dont have it now. So if we keep sending energy companies overseas. make it harder for them to produce. tax the energy consumption. it is going to be more difficult for us to exist in this world. So why dont we do something a little novel. Why dont we allow more energy exploration. instead of continuing to subsidize the Middle Eastern oil countries who dont like us anyway. If we explore more. that will create jobs that stay in America. It will bring revenue to the American Treasury. because those oil companies have to pay for those leases. We can then get more tax revenue from those oil companies. and money will stay here. instead of shipping it overseas to foreign countries. A novel idea. And there is not a tax included in any of that. But it seems to me. Mr. Speaker. that the current bureaucrats never saw a tax they didnt like. So we will all just get to ride bicycles and freeze in the cold dark of winter. and for light we will have to use candles since we cant afford to pay the electricity tax on our homes.

1110012997,Mr. President. I rise today in support of the economic recovery package on which we will soon vote. We are in the midst of the most severe recession since the Great Depression. Families and small businesses across this country and in my home State of New Hampshire are hurting. As a former Governor and small business owner. I know it is business and not government that creates jobs and drives new ideas and innovation. But I believe government has a vital role to play in helping business create jobs. especially in these very difficult economic times. These are very difficult economic times. New Hampshire is a small State. We have just over 1.3 million people. Yet. in December alone. nearly 73.000 weekly claims were filed for unemployment compensation. As you can see on this chart. that is more than double the number of unemployment claims of a year ago and almost triple what the unemployment claims were 2 years ago. Nationally. we lost almost 600.000 jobs in January alone. We are shedding jobs at an alarmingly fast rate in New Hampshire and across this country. That is why it is critical that we pass a robust economic recovery package and that we do it immediately. The economic recovery bill we are going to vote on is not perfect. I would have preferred more investment for roads and bridges. *for water treatment plants. for K12 and higher education buildings. Over the past year in New Hampshire. we lost almost 10 percent of our construction jobs. and investing in infrastructure creates goodpaying construction jobs now. with the money earned by these workers generating a multiplier effect of economic activity so that it strengthens our economy. not just now but in the future. If it were up to me alone. we would be investing more heavily in infrastructure. But. as President Obama said the other day. we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. This economic recovery bill is good. For example. with this bill. over $132 million in highway funding will come to New Hampshire for road and bridge construction. Monday. I toured the construction site for a long planned access road to our major airport in New Hampshire. the ManchesterBoston Regional Airport. The highway funding in this economic recovery package will expedite the completion of that access road to our major airport in Manchester. It will create 1.000 construction jobs. and it will unleash the full potential of the Manchester Airport. Almost $60 million will come bo New Hampshire for water and wastewater treatment plants. That will create good construction jobs. It will enable cities and towns to move forward with long overdue projects. The economic recovery package will also help small businesses obtain the financing they need to retain and create good jobs. This is critically important in New Hampshire. where 94 percent of our businesses have fewer than 100 employees. yet they employ half of the States workforce. The credit crunch has hit small businesses particularly hard. By temporarily waiving the Small Business Administration fees and increasing the loan guarantee cap. this economic recovery package is estimated to stimulate up to $20 billion in small business loans. We may need to do more in the coming months to help small businesses access the working capital they need to survive during the recession. Too many small businesses today are relying on credit cards and they are paying exorbitant interest rates to obtain working capital. As a member of the Small Business Committee. I will be vigilant at monitoring whether the actions we are taking now in this economic package are sufficient to provide small businesses with access to financing. This economic package will also put us on the path to energy independence by doubling our renewable energygenerating capacity over the next 3 years. By passing this legislation. we will make it possible for great projects across the country to get up and running. I had the opportunity to talk to some people behind one of those projects in our capital city of Concord. NH. A company called Concord Steam has a fully permitted 20megawatt biomass plant that is ready to go right now. Their challenge is getting the financing they need. If they are able to go forward. this combined heat and power plant will be built on a restored brownfields site. It will employ over 100 construction workers for the next year and a half. and it will create 25 permanent jobs at the plant. Because its fuel will be New Hampshire forest waste. this renewable powerplant will also create about 100 jobs in the timber industry. This project will benefit every single American because the steam heat and power that it produces will displace 12 million gallons of foreign oil each year. We need to pass this economic recovery package. not only because it will put people back to work and lay a foundation for longterm economic growth but also because we need to restore confidence in our economy. The American people have always risen to meet every challenge. They need to see their Government is ready to meet this economic challenge as well. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this economic recovery package and doing it as soon as possible.

They are promoting access to basic services. including clean water. sanitation facilities. food. and health care for poor women and girls. Yet Senator WICKER and other supporters of this amendment would deny women around the world this basic care because they believe misinformation that has been spread by antichoice lobbyists who say this fund would pay for coerced abortions. The reality is that our government already prohibits any money from being used to fund coerced abortions. ApLd. no U.S. money goes to China. This bill actually continues that policy. So all Senator WICKERS amendment would do is prevent women around the world from getting access to basic health care servicesservices that we take for granted here in the United States. All of us would agree that we want to see fewer abortions in the world. I certainly do not condone funding coercive abortion practices in China or anywhere else. And I cannot accept that we would deny women lifesaving care because of a dishonest lobbying campaign. Not only is contributing to UNFPA the right thing to doit is in our best interest. By helping to lift families out of poverty. and slow the spread of disease. we can reduce conflicts and bring stability and hope to some of the most troubled regions in the world. I am proud that President Obama is pledging to refund UNFPA after the previous administration consistently canceled funding for the agency. I urge my colleagues to vote down the Wicker amendment. So let me simply say that I believe that women around the world should have access to safe health care that will help them plan their families and stay free of diseases. These are basic rights. and that is why I oppose the amendment that is being offered by Senator WICKER to block funding to the United Nations Population Fund.",111120621,MURRAY,PATTY,S,WA,F,D,,voting,2009-03-05,102,Mrs. MURRAY,3902,4003,03052009.txt,3067,517,111,2009,madam presid believ women around world access safe health care help plan famili stay free diseas basic right rise opposit amend offer senat wicker block fund unit nation popul fund develop world complic pregnanc still one lead caus women half million women die yearon everi prevent complic pregnanc childbirth madam presid million women get access safe modern contracept even en want nev case hiv occur everi day mission ensur everi pregnanc want everi birth safe everi young person free everi girl woman treat digniti respect unit nation popul fund work everi day make thing better nearli year unfpa provid billion aid countri voluntari famili plan matern child health care help women surviv childbirth provid contracept help women plan famili stay free hivaid promot access basic servic includ clean water sanit facil food health care poor women girl yet senat wicker support amend would deni women around world basic care believ misinform spread antichoic lobbyist say fund would pay coerc abort realiti govern alreadi prohibit money use fund coerc abort us money goe china bill actual continu polici senat wicker amend would prevent women around world get access basic health care servicesservic take grant unit state us would agre want see fewer abort world certainli condon fund coerciv abort practic china anywher els accept would deni women lifesav care dishonest lobbi campaign contribut unfpa right thing doit best interest help lift famili poverti slow spread diseas reduc conflict bring stabil hope troubl region world proud presid obama pledg refund unfpa previou administr consist cancel fund agenc urg colleagu vote wicker amend let simpli say believ women around world access safe health care help plan famili stay free diseas basic right oppos amend offer senat wicker block fund unit nation popul fund,295,FALSE
1110030793,Mr. President. I support the budget resolution for fiscal year 2010. The resolution embraces many priorities that I strongly support. They include a renewed commitment to energy efficiency. educational improvements. middleclass tax cuts. and our veterans. The resolution preserves the major priorities in President Obamas budget that was submitted to Congress. The Presidents budget outlined a blueprint for addressing and reversing the effects of the deep recession. collapse of the housing and credit markets. and the rise in joblessness that we inherited from the previous administration by setting the stage for sustained economic growth through investments in energy. education. and infrastructure. which were begun in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. ARRA. Since President Obamas budget was submitted to Congress. the CBOs reestimate of that budget has added $2.3 trillion to longterm deficit projections. Accordingly. the resolution adjusts the Presidents budget to cut the longterm deficit in half from $1.2 trillion in fiscal year 2010 to $508 billion in fiscal year 2014 while retaining the Presidents core priorities. The resolution matches the funding level in the Presidents budget for fiscal year 2010 energy discretionary funding to reduce our dependence on foreign sources of fuel. produce green jobs. promote renewable energy development. and improve the electric transmission grid. while encouraging energy conservation and efficiency: I am pleased that this resolution continues with green investments made in the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act and provides increases for the energy efficiency and renewable energy program. The resolution will enable investments in further research and development in clean and sustainable energy technologies from resources that are abundant -in my State of Hawaii. such as wind. solar. ocean. hydrogen. and biomass. The resolution invests in our Nations future by fully funding the Presidents request for discretionary education and training programs. This includes expanding early childhood education programs that have proven to be so instrumental in preparing our Nations children for future success. The budget also increases support for programs designed to reach out to lowincome students so that every child has an equal opportunity to succeed. Similarly. by providing the necessary funding to support a $5.550 maximum Pell grant award in the 20102011 school year. this budget resolution will provide much needed assistance to individuals striving to achieve their higher education goals including adults returning to school to revise and revamp their skills in order to more effectively compete in todays workforce. I was also pleased to see that funding was included in the budget resolution to enhance and improve the capability of the Federal acquisition workforce. In my role as both chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management and a senior member of the Armed Services Committee. I have long advocated for improvements in the hiring and retention of Federal employees. Similarly. I strongly support funding for the reform of Department of Defense processes for the acquisition of weapons systems inclilding the reduction of nobid and costplus contracts. As chairman of the Federal Workforce Subcommittee. I am pleased the resolution provides pay parity between Federal civilian and military service.members in the average annual pay raise. which is consistent with more than 20 years of congressional precedent and my priorities. Turning to items in the budget resolution for the Department of Veterans Affairs. the resolution includes the Presidents request. plus $540 million to compensate for the illadvised proposal that would have billed veterans insurance companies for serviceconnected care. President Obama made the right decision not to move forward with that proposal. Veterans care and benefits are a cost of war and treatment for conditions directly related to service is the responsibility of the government alone. The resolution also includes mandatory budget authority for important benefits. such as compensation and pension. for veterans and their survivors. I look forward to working with my colleagues and the administration to enact the funding increases and targeted programs to help VA adapt to the changing needs of veterans and their loved ones. My colleagues. this resolution. with its targeted investments and changed publicpolicy priorities. will help us address the essential needs of the Nation. I urge my colleagues to support the budget resolution for fiscal year 2010.,111116411,AKAKA,DANIEL,S,HI,M,D,,voting,2009-04-02,1510,Mr. AKAKA,51788,51928,04022009.txt,4610,690,111,2009,mr presid support budget resolut fiscal year resolut embrac mani prioriti strongli support includ renew commit energi effici educ improv middleclass tax cut veteran resolut preserv major prioriti presid obama budget submit congress presid budget outlin blueprint address revers effect deep recess collaps hous credit market rise jobless inherit previou administr set stage sustain econom growth invest energi educ infrastructur begun american recoveri reinvest act arra sinc presid obama budget submit congress cbo reestim budget ad trillion longterm deficit project accordingli resolut adjust presid budget cut longterm deficit half trillion fiscal year billion fiscal year retain presid core prioriti resolut match fund level presid budget fiscal year energi discretionari fund reduc depend foreign sourc fuel produc green job promot renew energi develop improv electr transmiss grid encourag energi conserv effici pleas resolut continu green invest made american reinvest recoveri act provid increas energi effici renew energi program resolut enabl invest research develop clean sustain energi technolog resourc abund state hawaii wind solar ocean hydrogen biomass resolut invest nation futur fulli fund presid request discretionari educ train program includ expand earli childhood educ program proven instrument prepar nation children futur success budget also increas support program design reach lowincom student everi child equal opportun succeed similarli provid necessari fund support maximum pell grant award school year budget resolut provid much need assist individu strive achiev higher educ goal includ adult return school revis revamp skill order effect compet today workforc also pleas see fund includ budget resolut enhanc improv capabl feder acquisit workforc role chairman subcommitte oversight govern manag senior member arm servic committe long advoc improv hire retent feder employe similarli strongli support fund reform depart defens process acquisit weapon system reduct nobid costplu contract chairman feder workforc subcommitte pleas resolut provid pay pariti feder civilian militari servicememb averag annual pay rais consist year congression preced prioriti turn item budget resolut depart veteran affair resolut includ presid request plu million compens illadvis propos would bill veteran insur compani serviceconnect care presid obama made right decis move forward propos veteran care benefit cost war treatment condit directli relat servic respons govern alon resolut also includ mandatori budget author import benefit compens pension veteran survivor look forward work colleagu administr enact fund increas target program help va adapt chang need veteran love one colleagu resolut target invest chang publicpolici prioriti help us address essenti need nation urg colleagu support budget resolut fiscal year,402,TRUE

1110047222,"Madam President. I am proud to join my colleagues in expressing first and foremost my admiration for Senator KENNEDY. for his longstanding. vigorous leadership. which has been the impetus behind this legislation. Undeniably. Senator KENNEDY continues to serve as the strongest of champions on so many matters relating to health care. and I am certainly. as we all are. grateful for his tireless contributions to this major initiative. I also commend Senator DODD. who has been guiding this legislation here in the Senate. and I certainly appreciate all of his efforts to make sure that- this legislation becomes a reality. I also appreciate- the public health agencies and advocates who work ceaselessly to address -these serious public health problems associated with tobacco. as we all well know. and who are committed to the task of reducing youth smoking. I certainly want to commend States such as Maine that have- used their funds from the 1998 tobacco settlement. to reduce smoking rates. First and foremost. it is regrettable as the first decade of the 21st century draws to a close that we are even having this debate when the American Lung Association reports that cigarette smoke contains more than 4.800 chemicals. 69 of which are known to cause cancer. and that smoking is directly responsible for approximately 90 percent of lung cancer deaths. and that 8.6 million people in the United States have at least one serious illness caused by smoking. -In addition. the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that smoking costs the country $96 billion a year in health care costs and another $97 billion a year in lost productivity. It didnt have to be this way. Looking back over the last several Congresses. I can tell you that many of my Senate colleagues have engaged on this issue of tobacco usages ill effects for. the better part of a decade. I well recall during the 105th Congress at least five comprehensive tobacco policy bills which were introduced in the Senate. The Senate Commerce Committee. on which I have served. held no fewer than 10 hearings on issues ranging from how to implement the tobacco settlement to protecting children from the health risks of becoming a smoker to reviewing marketing and labeling restrictions that were. under consideration at the time. In 1997. Senator McCAIN. who then chaired the Commerce Committee. introduced the National Tobacco Policy and Youth Smoking Reduction Act. which contained many of the very same safeguards as the measure currently before us. While on the one hand it is irrefutable that protecting youth from the harms of smoking and ensuring tobacco products are manufactured under high standards was the correct course of action in 1997. how is it conceivable it has taken 12 years to get this right? Why. after the first warning 25 years ago by the Surgeon General on the hazards of smoking. has that message not been translated into law? Why is Congress taking this action now? What has changed since 1997 to prompt this renewed action? For one. there has been a justifiable drumbeat of outrage over fraudulent findings that has grown louder by the decade as the tobacco industry has been less than forthcoming. and at times deceitful. in providing consumers with information to make informed decisions about smoking. In fact. in August of 2006. a district court judge found that several tobacco companies intentionally manipulated information. lied. and conspired ""to bring new. young and hopefully longlived smokers into the market in order to replace those who die or quit."" Furthermore. the Harvard School of Public Health study in 2008 found that cigarette companies strategically manipulated menthol levels in cigarettes to attract and addict young people. It is bad enough Congress could have acted and chose not to do so. but what makes the situation even worse is that. in the interim. tobacco companies have ratcheted up their marketing campaigns. Congress is tackling the tobacco issue again in the wake of discovering how. tobacco manufacturers add substances to cigarettes to increase their addictiveness. enhance the tasteand this is unbelievablemaking them more palatable to children. Menthol makes an individuals airways less reactive to the harsh effects of smoking. and ammonia is often added to speed the delivery of nicotine to the smokers brain. That is not to say we havent made progress in trying to limit some of the negative health effects of cigarette smoking. We have. Since 1983. the proportion of Americans who smoke has declined from 30 to 24 percent. and since the landmark 1964 Surgeon General report. our knowledge of health risks of tobacco has expanded greatly. And yet. without substantial initiatives by Congress. in the past 10 years the rate of tobacco usehas not dropped but merely stabilized. Today. approximately 1 in 5 youth and adults smokes regularly. The first step toward addressing the enormous toll taken on our Nation by smoking is to equip the Federal Government with the tools it requires to hold purveyors of tobacco to account. For too long. there has been a vacuum in authority when it comes to regulating smoking at the Federal level. Our bill. the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. would create the kind of restrictions that the Food and Drug Administration unsuccessfully tried to impose on the tobacco industry in 2000. Unfortunately. the Supreme Court held that Congress had not yet granted the FDA explicit authority to regulate tobacco. The purpose of the FDA restrictions was to prevent the tobacco industry from marketing its products to kids or to create products that are specifically attractive to children. such as flavored cigarettes. Granting FDA the authority to protect the children from these potentially deadly products is paramount. Thus. the legislation before us would allow regulation of manufacturers of tobacco products in order to ensure standards of content-. label. and marketing. Under our bill. the Secretary of Health and Human Services would be authorized to develop regulations- that impose guidelines on the advertising and promotion of a tobacco product consistent with and to the full extent permitted by the first amendment to the Constitution. These regulations would be based on whether they would be appropriate for the protection of public health. It is imperative that we provide the FDA the flexibility to respond to inevitable tobacco industry attempts to circumvent restrictions. while acknowledging the rights of the tobacco industry to sell its products to consenting adults. While this bill allows that informed adults ought to be able to purchase to-. bacco products. we must also understand that many smokers want to quit smoking. In 2006. 44 percent of smokers stopped smoking at least 1 day in the preceding year because they were trying to quit smoking completely. Undoubtedly. for some. cessation is more difficult. and as they struggle to limit their risk. those individuals will seek out products which they understand to be less hazardous. such as lower tar.and nicotine products. While these actions are admirable. their benefits are indisputably limited. That is partially because the tobacco industry has waged a marketing campaign to convince consumers that they can continue to smoke and - mitigate the negative health impacts of smoking by choosing alternatives. such as light. low tar. and low nicotine cigarettes. Again. an FDA with the authority to regulate the production and marketing of tobacco productsis the most viable answer. Our approach would also ensure that the scientific expertise of the FDA is applied to appropriately regulate tobacco. Current smokers deserve to learn moreabout the products they consume. Additionally. we must have much improved marketing oversight. so that children and adults are not targeted with false or deceptive adver: tising of a dangerous product. To that end. I was pleased to join with Senator LAUTENBERG in sponsoring legislation that would end the fraud of allowing the tobacco industry to perpetuate the Orwellian idea of the safer cigarette. The Truth in Cigarette Labeling Act was a bill Senator LAUTENBERG and I introduced to prohibit the cigarette companies from usingthe ""FTC method"" for measuring tar and nicotine. which had been found to be a deceptive method of presenting data on tar and nicotine exposure through smoking. Thankfully. the Federal Trade Commission agreed to implement the LautenbergSnowe bill by not allowing tobacco companies to label their products with low tar. low nicotine. and light. To augment that effort. Senator LAUTENBERG and I sent a letter to the FTC supporting the decision to curtail these deceptive marketing tactics and finally holding cigarette producers to higher standards in advertising their products. As I stated at the outset. since 2000. efforts at smoking reduction have largely atrophied. A Harris poll released just last year demonstrated that after two decades of reduction in smoking rates. progress has stalled. In 2009. do we really want to say that one in four Americans smoking is an acceptable statistic. and that we will turn a blind eye to the fact that all too many young Americans have taken up smoking? Do we really want to say that although in the last 12 years America created YouTube. the IPod. the Iphone and moreyet we cant keep children from smoking altogether or substantially lower the instances of smoking by adults. Our response must be nothing less than the bill we are championing today. And make no mistake. time is of the essence. The reality is the average smoker begins at age 19. So many individuals take up tobacco use before they can ever legally purchase the product. And let there be no mistake about itour youth are targeted to be the next generation of tobacco consumers.  In fact. in my home State of Maine. 1 in 7 high school students currently smokes. and each year. 1.600 youth become new daily smokers. And most concerning. an estimated 27.000 youth now living in Maine will die prematurely from health consequences related to cigarette smoking. and health care costs in Maine directly caused by smoking have reached a whopping $602 million annually. Maine has responded with a comprehensive tobacbo prevention and control program known as the Partnership for a TobaccoFree Maine which is funded with proceeds from the tobacco settlement. And I am proud to say that Maine is among the States that have maximized their tobacco settlement money for the :purpose of reducing smoking rates and easing related he alth problems. That is why Maine has established Healthy Maine Partnerships. including 31 local partnerships that span the entire geography of Maine. which are engaging in more than 156 policy and environmental change efforts to reduce tobacco use. increase physical activity. and encourage healthy eating at local schools. worksites. hospitals. recreation centers and other community sites. While I commend the efforts of States such as Maine in- attempting to stem the tide of youth smoking. what we have not yet dealt with is the known practices of tobacco companies marketing directly to our children. The fact is. the industry has not only targeted children as its new customers. but it has designed products for them as well. Even as one prohibition is imposedsuch as restricting the use of cartoon characters like ""Joe Camel""we find that the tobacco industry devises a new scheme. We witnessed the new flavored products in packaging which was designed to appeal to a new generation. Many ""childoriented"" flavors have been developed including such varieties as chocolate. vanilla. berry. lime and the package I am holdingcoconutandpineappleflavored Kauai Koala. Although Statelevel bills to ban flavored cigarettes have been introduced in New York. Minnesota. West Virginia. Connecticut. Illinois. North Carolina. and Texasa move in the right direction to ..be surethere -is more we must do. It is time for Congress to act to protect .our youthto safeguard our children and in the process send a clear message to those in the tobacco industry that we willnot permit them to recruit our children at increasingly younger ages to become lifelong cigarette smokers. . Our bill will achieve .what we failed to accomplish 12 years ago. and we can ill afford to allow this opportunity to pass. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this timely and necessary legislation to protect the health of all Americans. especially the millions of children at risk of becoming cigarette smokers.

1110061857,Many of the czars on the list seem to either duplicate or dilute the statutory authority and responsibilities that Congress has already conferred upon Cabinet level officials and other senior executive branch officials who go through the normal constitutional process whereby the Senate gives its consent to these nominees. As I said when I first introduced this amendment. I do not consider every position that has been identified as a czar in various media reports to be problematic. Some of those positions are established by law. Some of them are subject to Senate confirmation. Rather. my amendment is carefully tailored so it would not cover and would not apply to positions recognized in law or subject to Senate confirmation. For example. the proposal I have would not apply to the Director of National Intelligence. to the National Security Advisor. to the Homeland Security Advisor. to the Chairman of the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board. or to the socalled information or regulatory czar within OMB. These positions. because they are recognized in law. or they are subject to Senate confirmation. simply do not raise the same kinds of concerns about accountability. transparency. oversight. and vetting. Instead. my amendment has been carefully tailored to cover officials that the President has unilaterally designated as responsible for significant policy matters. It would not have covered the Presidents Chief of Staff. for example. and it would not cover less senior White House officials. despite some misinformation to the contrary. Because the White House has raised so many objections to my amendment. I have offered to sit down with the White House counsel and narrow the scope of the amendment further. to address any concerns the White House might have. Unfortunately. the White House has failed to provide any modification to the text of my amendment. Instead. they said they did not want any of these officials to be called to testify before Congress. Let me explain exactly what my amendment would have done. so you can see how modest indeed the amendment was. The amendment simply would have required that the President certify to Congress that officials in these important positions would respond to all reasonable requests to testify before or provide information to congressional committees with jurisdiction over the issues involved. Second. it simply would have required these officials to submit a biannual report to the congressional committee with jurisdiction. describing the activities of the official and his or her office. and any rule. regulation. or policy that the official participated in or assisted in the development of. That is it. How can we possibly be against that kind of accountability. transparency. and oversight? It is our job as Members of Congress to conduct such oversight. We cannot do so when the administration sets up a structure where there is an energy czar. an urban affairs czar. an environmental czar. a cybersecurity czarthe list goes on and on. It creates confusion over who is in charge. who is making policy. Lets take the area of health care. Is the top policy position in this administration NancyAnn DeParle. who is the health care czar within the Executive Office of the Presidenta person. by the way. for whom I have the greatest respector is it Senateconfirmed Kathleen Sebelius. the Secretary of Health and Human Services? Who is in charge? Whom do we hold accountable? What the President has done by creating so many czar positions within the White House that appear to duplicate the executive branch officials who are subject to Senate confirmation is to blur the lines of authority.

1110026390,Mr. President. I am today introducing legislation to make various improvements to VA rural health care. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senators MAX BAUCUS and MARK BEGICH. The legislation is designed to bring more doctors into small communities. promote the use of volunteer counselors to help with mental health issues. expand telemedicine services. and create incentives for VAs community partners to provide high quality services to veterans. As the drawdown of forces in Iraq begins. VA must be prepared to meet the health care needs of veterans upon their return. Many veterans live in small towns and communities. This includes a large number of Guard members and Reservists who have served in such an integral role in Iraq and Afghanistan. Members of the Guard and Reserve face challenges that are different than those faced by their active duty counterparts. who return to military bases with the support of their unit and programs geared toward reacclimating them to life outside of the combat zone. When members of the Guard or Reserves return home. they often are isolated from their units. leaving them to reintegrate back into their communities without a strong VA or DoD presence or support system. When health care is needed. a rural community may not have providers who offer mental health services. such as group counseling. and may not be familiar with treating combatrelated disorders. I believe strongly that there is an obligation to care for all veterans in need. regardless of where they live. We must ensure that adequate resources are available to serve those who live in rural communities. and that VA works closely with local health care providers to help meet the need for care. It is critical that VA reach out to veterans living in rural communities so that they receive the care they need. Every resource must be united in the effort to care for wounded warriors. whether in a community hospital or VA clinic. When there is no VA presence in a community. VA may need to pay community providers for the reasonable costs of care. Last month. the Committee on Veterans Affairs held a hearing on health care for veterans in rural areas. We heard from the chief executive officer of a community hospital. from a former director of a rural health clinic. and from outreach orgaftizations who work to bridge the gap between VA and community health care systems. These witnesses testified about how hard it is for veterans who live in rural areas to find health care in the communities where they live. and about how difficult it is for community hospitals and clinics to provide quality services with the limited resources available to them. Committee on Veterans Affairs staff also conducted an oversight visit to Hawaii and saw firsthand the needs of veterans living in rural communities on the neighbor islands. Many of those veterans find it hard to access VA health care because of travel restrictions and a shortage of services in their communities. Committee staff found that technology was not being used to bridge this gap. indeed. the use of telemedicine is actually declining in Hawaii. The legislation we are introducing today would help address the needs of veterans living in rural communities in a number of ways. First. the bill would bring more doctors to targeted communities by repaying their student loans while they work for VA. Currently. VAs loan repayment program is capped at an amount that is less than 13 the average cost of medical school. This bill would remove the cap. allowing VA to offer full loan repayment so as to provide a much more effective recruitment tool. In addition. this bill would encourage VA and HHS to use the National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program to recruit physicians for VA facilities located in underserved areas. The National Health Service Corps pays for medical school up front in exchange for a doctors agreement to work in an underserved area after graduation. To address the shortage of mental health providers in many communities. this legislation would also allow VA to shorten the credentialing and privileging process for licensed volunteer counselors who could provide mental health services to our veterans. The legislation would also create a pilot program to place VA doctors in community hospitals so as to enable them to provide more continuous care for veterans. Under this pilot. VA doctors working in communities without a VA hospital would be able to follow their patients when admitted to the local hospital. Participating VA doctors would earn additional compensation for assuming these responsibilities. thereby creating financial incentives for doctors to stay within VA. Since many nonVA hospitals do not have mental health providers or other providers experienced in the treatment of conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder that disproportionately affect veterans. this would also bring needed expertise into other care communities. This bill would also allow VA to monitor the quality of care provided in nonVA facilities. Currently. there is no way for VA to do such quality assurance in a systematic way. This bill would encourage VAs community partners to participate in quality programs like peer review. or to seek accreditation by an outside organization. This bill also would bring new technologies to rural communities. By modifying VAs internal mechanism for distributing funds. the legislation would provide incentives for VA hospitals and clinics to use telehealth technologies. VA currently bases the distribution of funds to its facilities on workload and does not currently count all telehealth visits in a facilitys workload. By requiring VA to give hospitals and clinics credit for telehealth visits. this bill will promote the natural expansion of these services to our veterans. Finally. for those veterans who must travel by air to obtain their health carebecause of their health status. geography or other barriersthis bill would allow VA to pay beneficiary travel benefits for airfare to those veterans who cannot afford it. In recognition of the cost of airfare. a different income eligibility standard from that used for grbind transportation would be used in connection with reimbursement of the costs of air travel. I urge our colleagues to work with me and the other members of the Veterans Affairs Committee to improve access tohealth care for veterans who live in rural areas. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.,111116411,AKAKA,DANIEL,S,HI,M,D,,voting,2009-03-30,164,Mr. AKAKA,11540,11735,03302009.txt,6533,1065,111,2009,mr presid today introduc legisl make variou improv va rural health care pleas join effort senat max baucu mark begich legisl design bring doctor small commun promot use volunt counselor help mental health issu expand telemedicin servic creat incent va commun partner provid high qualiti servic veteran drawdown forc iraq begin va must prepar meet health care need veteran upon return mani veteran live small town commun includ larg number guard member reservist serv integr role iraq afghanistan member guard reserv face challeng differ face activ duti counterpart return militari base support unit program gear toward life outsid combat zone member guard reserv return home often isol unit leav reintegr back commun without strong va dod presenc support system health care need rural commun may provid offer mental health servic group counsel may familiar treat combatrel disord believ strongli oblig care veteran need regardless live must ensur adequ resourc avail serv live rural commun va work close local health care provid help meet need care critic va reach veteran live rural commun receiv care need everi resourc must unit effort care wound warrior whether commun hospit va clinic va presenc commun va may need pay commun provid reason cost care last month committe veteran affair held hear health care veteran rural area heard chief execut offic commun hospit former director rural health clinic outreach work bridg gap va commun health care system wit testifi hard veteran live rural area find health care commun live difficult commun hospit clinic provid qualiti servic limit resourc avail committe veteran affair staff also conduct oversight visit hawaii saw firsthand need veteran live rural commun neighbor island mani veteran find hard access va health care travel restrict shortag servic commun committe staff found technolog use bridg gap inde use telemedicin actual declin hawaii legisl introduc today would help address need veteran live rural commun number way first bill would bring doctor target commun repay student loan work va current va loan repay program cap amount less averag cost medic school bill would remov cap allow va offer full loan repay provid much effect recruit tool addit bill would encourag va hh use nation health servic corp scholarship program recruit physician va facil locat underserv area nation health servic corp pay medic school front exchang doctor agreement work underserv area graduat address shortag mental health provid mani commun legisl would also allow va shorten credenti privileg process licens volunt counselor could provid mental health servic veteran legisl would also creat pilot program place va doctor commun hospit enabl provid continu care veteran pilot va doctor work commun without va hospit would abl follow patient admit local hospit particip va doctor would earn addit compens assum respons therebi creat financi incent doctor stay within va sinc mani nonva hospit mental health provid provid experienc treatment condit posttraumat stress disord disproportion affect veteran would also bring need expertis care commun bill would also allow va monitor qualiti care provid nonva facil current way va qualiti assur systemat way bill would encourag va commun partner particip qualiti program like peer review seek accredit outsid organ bill also would bring new technolog rural commun modifi va intern mechan distribut fund legisl would provid incent va hospit clinic use telehealth technolog va current base distribut fund facil workload current count telehealth visit facil workload requir va give hospit clinic credit telehealth visit bill promot natur expans servic veteran final veteran must travel air obtain health carebecaus health statu geographi bill would allow va pay beneficiari travel benefit airfar veteran afford recognit cost airfar differ incom elig standard use transport would use connect reimburs cost air travel urg colleagu work member veteran affair committe improv access care veteran live rural area mr presid ask unanim consent text bill print record,633,FALSE

1110004060,Madam President. I appreciate the leadership of the chair of our Foreign Relations Committee. Senator KERRY. In the short time he has assumed the responsibilities of that most important committee. he has done a remarkably good job. and the best is yet to come. He mentioned here briefly some of the things he wants to do dealing with the scourge we find ourselves in with global warming. and it is going to be remarkable. the work he does. Madam President. we are moving forward on the vote on the nomination of Senator HILLARY CLINTON to be Secretary of State. Senator CLINTON is uniquely capable and profoundly prepared to lead our State Department at a time of unprecedented global challenges. and at a time when quick confirmation of President Obamas national security team is critical to protect us here at home. We face two wars abroad. a complex and unpredictable crisis in the Middle East. the nuclear ambitions of a volatile Iranian regime. together with the complexities of dealing with North Korea. Senator CLINTON has earned the admiration and respect of the global community with her understafiding that our international power must be both strong and smart. that the true measure of our influence is not just the size and strength of our military. but also how we use other tools. including diplomacy and foreign assistance. to make the world safer and more free. Senator CLINTONS exemplary qualifications and wise world view were demonstrated in her confirmation hearings. where she showed a tremendous breadth and depth of knowledge on the major foreign policy issues we face in the world today. We all remember HILLARY CLINTONs arrival in the Senate a few short years ago8 years ago. Some wonderedand some out loudwhether a former First Lady who had become a favored target of the rightwing could forge the relationships necessary to be an effective Senator for the people of New York State. She answered that loud. and she answered it very clear. Some questioned whether a person of such national and international acclaim would put in the time to get to know the inner workings of the Senate and the nittygritty of the legislative process. She answered that big time. It took no time for Senator CLINTON to make believers from those doubters. She became an instant favorite of Democrats and Republicans alike. a forceful advocate for both smart foreign policies and domestic policies. and a remarkably effective student of bipartisanship. In her time as First Lady of our country. serving as an American emissary to the world. and then in the Senate as a member of the Armed Services Committee. HILLARY CLINTON built the diplomatic skills and breadth of knowledge one needs to be our next Secretary of State. She has the full package. All but one member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to approve this outstanding nominee. Democrats and Republicans alike stand in support of our friend and colleague. Senator CLINTON. I want spread on the RECORD my appreciation for JOHN MCCAIN coming to the floor and saying: Lets approve her now. He tried to do that earlier today. I ask all my colleagues to join me in sending the world a clear message that we stand behind President Obama and our new Secretary of State as they proceed together to the task of rebuilding our foreign policy to be stronger. smarter. and more able to effectively lead the world with moral strength once again.

1110017726,Mr. President. I take the floor in defense of one of our most successful environmental statutes. Since its nearly unanimous passage in 1973. the Endangered Species Act has protected nearly 2.000 species from extinction. That success has contributed significantly to the economic benefit of this Nation. According to a study by the Fish and Wildlife Service. wildliferelated recreationmeaning hunting and fishing and wildlife watchinggenerated more than $122 billion in revenue in 2006. So this statute has protected wildlife diversity and has protected our economy. In my home State of Maryland. wildlife watching generated over $1 billion in revenue and sustained over 10.000 jobs. . In December of 2008. the Bush administration finalized two rules that undercut the success of the Endangered Species. Act. Now. that was in December of 2008. after the elections. after Senator Obama was elected President of the United States. The Bush administration issued two regulations in an effort to undermine the Endangered Species Act. One rule undermines important safeguards for all threatened and endangered species. The other withholds key protections from the polar bear. I believe it is critical the safeguards that have worked to protect endangered species for decades be reinstated. Section 429 of the fiscal year 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act would give the Secretaries of Interior and Commerce the authority they need to do that. It will allow the Secretaries to reverse the Bush administrations midnight regulations and reinstate the regulations previously in place. To understand why this special authority is needed. I think it is helpful to understand how devastating the rule changes are. So let me say a little bit about the two rules President Bush put in place. For decades. under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act. Federal agencies have consulted with scientists at the Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service to make sure an agencys planned actions do not jeopardize a threatened or endangered species. In line with a long record that expressed a low regard for science. in December. 2008. the Bush administration finalized a rule that effectively eliminated the critical role scientists play in the section 7 system of checks and balances. What the Bush administration regulation did was to allow a Federal agency to avoid consultation with the scientists in making its determination as to whether th6re was an impact on an endangered species. Professional scientific organizations argued. came out and said. quite frankly. this is unacceptable. The agency does not have the capacity to make a determination as to whether a species is endangered by the action of the agency. They do not have the budget. They do not have the expertise. And. quite frankly. they have a different mission. So the impact of this regulation could have a devastating impact on the protectionlegitimate protection--of wildlife. Now. some of my colleagues argue that requiring consultation with independent scientists will slow infrastructure projects funded through the recently passed American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. But let me remind my colleagues that the projects that are ready to go have already gone through this environmental review. They are ready to go. They will not be delayed as a result of section 7 of the Endangered Species Act. We are ready to proceed. And as President Obama recently said: With smart. sustainable policies. we can grow our economy today and preserve the environment. But. quite frankly. these changes to the consultation rule were not the only regulations the Bush administration issued. We had the one that would compromise consultation with scientists in issuing the appropriate safeguards under the Endangered Species Act. The other was specifically aimed toward the polar bear. The new rule granted no new protections to the polar bear. Now. the Presidents regulations said differently. but that is not the case. The special rule not only denied additional protections normally provided under the Endangered Species Act. but it set a bad precedent for weakening ESA safeguards. The new rule does not require plans to monitor. minimize. or mitigate impacts that could harm the bears. And the rule does not allow scientists and agencies to even consider climate change as a factor that could injure polar bears. Last year. I had the opportunity. along with members of the Environment and Public Works Committee. to visit Greenland. We saw firsthand what is happening in regard to the loss of the snow caps and the impact it is having on the polar bear population. Global climate change is clearly affecting the future stability of the polar bears. and the regulation that was issued in December compromises that. It is quite clear why. Seven editorials from newspapers in 32 States oppose the Bush administrations efforts. Dozens of wildlife. scientific. and environmental organizations oppose the change. In addition. eight State attorneys general. including the attorney general of Maryland. have filed suit to have these regulations withdrawn. So we have an amendment that has been offered. The amendment would take out of the omnibus bill the additional authority we want to give to the agencies so that they can reverse the midnight changes attempted by the Bush administration. I would urge my colleagues to reject that amendment. Lets not compromise the protections we have in -the Endangered Species Act that allow Federal agencies to have the best information before they take action on their projects. It is what we should be doing. It does preserve the diversity of wildlife in this Nation. It maintains the leadership of the United States on these types of issues. It is the right policy. We should go through regular order when we change it. The Bush administration did not do that. They did this as a lastminute gesture of the Bush administration. Lets restore the status quo. and then lets look at the normal regulation process for modifications that may be needed. I would urge my colleagues to reject the amendment offered that will undermine the Endangered Species Act. With that. I yield the floor.,111118121,CARDIN,BENJAMIN,S,MD,M,D,,voting,2009-03-05,32,Mr. CARDIN,660,835,03052009.txt,6188,992,111,2009,mr presid take floor defens one success environment statut sinc nearli unanim passag endang speci act protect nearli speci extinct success contribut significantli econom benefit nation accord studi fish wildlif servic wildliferel hunt fish wildlif billion revenu statut protect wildlif divers protect economi home state maryland wildlif watch gener billion revenu sustain job decemb bush administr final two rule undercut success endang speci act decemb elect senat obama elect presid unit state bush administr issu two regul effort undermin endang speci act one rule undermin import safeguard threaten endang speci withhold key protect polar bear believ critic safeguard work protect endang speci decad reinstat section fiscal year omnibu appropri act would give secretari interior commerc author need allow secretari revers bush administr midnight regul reinstat regul previous place understand special author need think help understand devast rule chang let say littl bit two rule presid bush put place decad section endang speci act feder agenc consult scientist fish wildlif servic nation marin fisheri servic make sure agenc plan action jeopard threaten endang speci line long record express low regard scienc decemb bush administr final rule effect elimin critic role scientist play section system check balanc bush administr regul allow feder agenc avoid consult scientist make determin whether thre impact endang speci profession scientif organ argu came said quit frankli unaccept agenc capac make determin whether speci endang action agenc budget expertis quit frankli differ mission impact regul could devast impact protectionof wildlif colleagu argu requir consult independ scientist slow infrastructur project fund recent pass american recoveri reinvest act let remind colleagu project readi go alreadi gone environment review readi go delay result section endang speci act readi proceed presid obama recent said smart sustain polici grow economi today preserv environ quit frankli chang consult rule regul bush administr issu one would compromis consult scientist issu appropri safeguard endang speci act specif aim toward polar bear new rule grant new protect polar bear presid regul said differ case special rule deni addit protect normal provid endang speci act set bad preced weaken esa safeguard new rule requir plan monitor minim mitig impact could harm bear rule allow scientist agenc even consid climat chang factor could injur polar bear last year opportun along member environ public work committe visit greenland saw firsthand happen regard loss snow cap impact polar bear popul global climat chang clearli affect futur stabil polar bear regul issu decemb compromis quit clear seven editori newspap state oppos bush administr effort dozen wildlif scientif environment organ oppos chang addit eight state attorney gener includ attorney gener maryland file suit regul withdrawn amend offer amend would take omnibu bill addit author want give agenc revers midnight chang attempt bush administr would urg colleagu reject amend let compromis protect endang speci act allow feder agenc best inform take action project preserv divers wildlif nation maintain leadership unit state type issu right polici go regular order chang bush administr lastminut gestur bush administr let restor statu quo let look normal regul process modif may need would urg colleagu reject amend offer undermin endang speci act yield floor,518,TRUE
1110029562,Madam Chair. today I rise in support of the fiscal year 2010 budget resolution. Todays vote on the budget is a critical one. not only because it finally invests resources in domestic priorities. but because it also takes into consideration the needs of our families. Our economy is suffering. financial markets are in turmoil. and back home in Michigan we are facing an unemployment rate of 12 percent. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle suggest cutting our spending. while also providing huge tax cuts for their fat cat friends and more subsidies for oil and gas companies. These are not the folks that need govemment tax breaks and subsidies. If it is not the govemment who will pump money into our economy. provide tax cuts to our families and make health care and education more affordable. then who will? We know that our banks are not lending. families are living paycheck to paycheck. and our small businesses and companies are struggling to maintain their payroll. The status quo is not an option. For the first time in eight long years we have a President who proposed a budget that takes into consideration the longterm stability of our country and provides a strong economic plan to guide us out of this recession. To that end. Congress proposes cutting the deficit by neary twothirds by 2013. reducing discretionary spending to its lowest level ever. and including initiatives to cut waste. fraud and abuse. saving taxpayers neariy $50 billion. And for the first time. Congress and the administration are including the costs of the Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in the budget. no longer hiding the costs in supplemental legislation. Yes. Congress -and this administration is tackling a lot at once. not only because the last administration left a platter of problems at our feet. but also because we can no longer afford to put off health care reform. or climate change. or quality education. Our country and our economy need a longterm solution. Through this budget we will begin to tackle the rising costs of healthcare by reducing high administrative costs and rooting out inefficiencies. We will ensure that Medicare physician payments -provide clear incentives for better quality care and ensure that primary care physicians are compensated for the hard work that they do. All of these steps will set the stage for health care reform and provide a down payment for legislation this summer. This budget also continues our investment in education by raising the maximum Pell grant award. including additional assistance to help more lowincome students complete college. This is critical to ensuring that our current and future employers continue to have a highly educated workforce. We need to keep our workforce competitive with our neighbors abroad and I strongly believe that ensuring access to education for all is one way to do that. Finally. we will look towards laying the foundation for climate change legislation this summer by ensuring that funding and tax incentives in the stimulus bill receive significant fundingproducing new sources of energy and creating green jobs across the country. Further. it will set aside funding to be used to pay for climate change legislation that the House and Senate are working on as we speak. This will ensure that the final product that makes it to the Presidents desk is paid for. allowing for responsible legislation that will cut greenhouse gas emissions. promote energy independence. and create new jobs in the energy sector. I want to commend the leadership of the Obama administration and Chairman SPRAr for all of their hard work to put together this budget proposal. I know that producing a budget that will address the problems of the last eight years. while also investing in the priorities of our families. was not an easy task. However. it is high time that the budget helps all Americans. not just the wealthy.

1110064771,"Mr. President. my home State of Delaware has been the recipient of some good news this week and so I thought this would be a good time to come to the floor and discuss how Delaware is leading the way in responding to the challenge of climate change and creating green jobs. This is a critical time in our history. At stake are the jobs and economic future of our children and grandchildren. Unfortunately. as we emerge from this economic crisis. many of the jobs we have lost will not return. To make a full recovery. we need to create the next generation of jobs. I believe that the jobs leading the way will be the clean and green energy industries of tomorrow. I am proud to say that my home State of Delaware is already leading the way. Like many States. my State once had a proud record of automobile manufacturing. All of my colleagues know. though. that the recent economic downturn has hit already downtrodden auto companies especially hard. and. in recent months. our two auto plants were closed. This is not simply a question of economics. For the families who saw paychecks end and the dignity of work disappear. these closures were a real personal tragedy. The men and women who worked in our auto plants are some of the most dedicated. capable workers I have ever met. They embraced an American dreamthe chance to work hard at a decent job and provide for a family. And then. in the midst of an economic crisis not seen in decades. they found themselves looking to start over. They did their job. They held up their side of the bargain. They went to work everyday and worked hard at their joband in the process made our GM plant and our Chrysler plant two of the most productive and efficient plants around. That is why we from Delaware have been fighting to help them land on their feet. We know the potential of these trained. hardworking. eager employees. and we know the decency of these families. Just recently. I was able to join Vice President BIDEN. Delaware Governor Markell. and our congressional delegation in announcing that Fisker Automotive will begin building plugin hybrids at the old General Motors Boxwood Road plant. In a few years time. we expect that Fisker will be building cars that get more than 100 miles per gallonand building as many as 100.000 of them per year. This will mean nearly 1.500 permanent manufacturing jobs. Before we get there. there will be hundreds or thousands of good construction jobs created by revamping and renovating the plant to produce these stateoftheart vehicles. But this happy tale is not possible without crucial support. Fisker was awarded a loan by the Department of Energy. part of a program designed to jump start the production of advanced vehicles. At the same time. Governor Jack Markell has worked hard to keep the plant in condition to be retooled. and to convince Fisker that Delaware offers the ideal market to begin building tomorrows cars. And I believe the clincher was the highly trained workforce we had to offer. In fact. Fisker will be hiring many of the GM employees to work back in their old buildingto work at building a stateoftheart advanced car. At the same time. the University of Delaware has announced a plan to buy the old Chrylser Newark plant and convert it to an advanced research facility. These 272 acres adjacent to the campus are truly. as University of Delaware president Patrick Harker has said. a ""once in a lifetime opportunity."" And the university has indicated that much of this research and development to be carried out there will be toward the energy technologies we will need to combat climate change and to compete in tomorrows economy. In fact. the university is already a leader in any of these fields. It is a recognized center of excellence for solar power research and education. as designated by the Department of Energy. and a center of excellence for composite materials as well. Just this week. the university was awarded nearly $4.5 million for research into magnetic materials from a new program called ARPAE. The Advanced Research Projects AgencyEnergy has a mission. ""to develop nimble. creative. and inventive approaches to transform the global energy landscape while advancing Americas technology leadership."" The research the University of Delaware is doing could greatly increase the efficiency of electric motorsfor electric and hybrid vehicles and for wind turbines alike. At the same time. it could drastically reduce our imports of rare Earth minerals that often come from the darkest corners of our world. At the same time. DuPont was winning $9 million from ARPAE for its research into seaweedbased biobutanol. What is biobutanol. my colleagues may ask. The answer is that biobutanol is an advanced fuel designed for use in place of gasoline. We have heard a lot about ethanol and how it can transform our energy landscape and it will play a very significant roleand already does. But it is not flawless. It tends to be corrosive. meaning that we cannot use our existing pipeline infrastructure and that we must retrofit our vehicles. At the same time. it has a lower energy density than gasolinein other words. fewer miles per gallon. Biobutanol may very well have fixed those problems. It has nearly the energy density of gasoline and is much less corrosive than ethanol. And now. thanks to research from DuPont and others. we are learning how to make it from seaweed. Imagine a scalable source of biomasssolarpowered. lowcarbon bioenergythat does not take up existing arable land or demand potable water. Imagine a fuel built from that source that operates like conventional gasoline. Wouldnt that be a big step forward for addressing our climate challenges and for ensuring that tomorrows vehicles will be powered by American ideas? And DuPont is leading in several other fields. It is an innovator in thinfilm solar panels. cellulosic ethanol. and fuel cells. Across town. W.L. Gore. whom we all know for the miracle fabric GoreTex. is a market leader in the membranes essential for fuel cells. If we hope to move someday to a hydrogen vehicle. and I do. we will need their expertise and excellence. Perhaps the most significant renewable energy project underway in Delaware. however. is actually happening just outside of Delaware. It is happening in our ocean. A company called Bluewater Wind is leading the way in developing offshore wind power in the United States. In countries like Denmark and the United Kingdom. they have already recognized that the abundant ocean breezes provide a vast. constant. renewable source of electricity. It is time for us to catch up. In fact. the Delaware offshore wind park will be larger than all offshore wind farms currently in existence. although other large farms are being planned and built in other countries. What it will be is Americas first. In fact. Delaware yesterday hosted the Nations first Federal offshore renewable energy task force meeting. When the Department of Energy has concluded that offshore wind can meet 70 percent of all domestic electricity needs. how can we afford to ignore this resource? And when nations around the world have wind. waves. and electricity demand. shouldnt we try to claim the leadership position in this technology? That is why I am glad that the Federal Government. by providing the right incentives for wind power. and the State of Delaware. by working with Bluewater to ensure that there will be demand for that power. have convinced Bluewater Wind that Delaware is the place to start. Mr. President. I could name hundreds of other areas where Delaware and Delawareans are leading the way in creating tomorrows jobs. We are installing combined heat and power projects to increase the efficiency of a chemical factory and of a community college. Our port is aiming to revamp its infrastructure to take advantage of green technologies that will make it cleaner and cheaper to operate. We have set up an innovative new financing mechanism. the Sustainable Energy Utility. that will help get clean technologies through the socalled ""valley of death."" Even our schools are getting in on the act. installing solar panels on gymnasium rooftops. We have small start up companies that are leading the way on a whole host of technologies. from less toxic disinfectants to safety reflectors. windmills and biofuels to recycling old carpet. Companies like ILC Dover. that manufacture components of space suits. are leading the way in developing advanced materials. while CMI Electric. a solar panel seller and installer. has a banner on its Web site that says ""We are hiring apply here."" We need more of those five words. I congratulate the leaders of my State. in industry and government. in academia and private life. for recognizing that the future of our economy and. thus. the legacy we leave future generations depends on leading the way on green technologies and in green industries.",111116211,KAUFMAN,EDWARD,S,DE,M,D,,voting,2009-10-30,20,Mr. KAUFMAN,2844,3130,10302009.txt,8912,1500,111,2009,mr presid home

1110039920,"Mr. President. for the last several weeks there has been a hue and cry from the other side of the aisle. a steady procession of Republican Senators. concerning the Presidents intention to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. I would like to remind colleagues this is a problem President Obama inherited from the previous administration. and it is worth a few moments to review the history. After the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States. the Bush administration decided to set aside treaties that had served us in past conflicts. They sent detainees to the Guantanamo facility and claimed the right to seize anyone. including American citizens in the United States. and to hold them indefinitely without legal rights. GEN Colin Powell. then the Sec.retary of.State to President George W. Bush. objected. He said the administrations policy: Will reverse over a century of U.S. policy and practice . . . and undermine the protections of the law of war for our own troops I I I It will undermine public support among critical allies. making military cooperation more difficult to sustain. GEN Colin Powell. former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. then Secretary of State to George W. Bush. Secretary Powells words were prophetic. Guantanamo became an international embarrassment for the United States and. sadly. tragically. a recruiting tool for terrorists such as alQaida. The Supreme Court repeatedly held that the adminisfrations detention policies were illegal. As Justice Sandra Day OConnor famously wrote for the majority inthe Hamdi difficult decision: A state of war is not a blank check for the President. Today. nearly 8 years after the 9/11 attacks. none of the terrorists who planned those attacks has been brought to justice. After he left the Bush administration. Colin Powell spoke out publicly again. He said: Guantanamo has become a major. major problem . . . in the way the world perceives America. ... We dont need it and it is causing us far more damage than any good we get for it. That is not a quote from the ACLU. That came from GEN Colin .Powell. former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former Secretary of State. A lot of others agree. Four other former Secretaries of State. Republican and Democratic. have weighed in: Henry Kissinger. Madeleine Albright. James Baker. and Warren Christopher have all called for Guantanamo to be closed. As Secretary Baker explained: We all agreed one of the best things that could happen would be to close Guantanamo. which is a very serious blot on our reputation. Former Navy general counsel Alberto Mora testified in the Senate Armed Services Committee. saying: There are serving U.S. flakrank officers who maintain that the first and second identifiable causes of U.S. combat deaths ip Iraqas judged by their effectiveness In recruiting insurgent flghtes into combat--axe respectively the symbols of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo. This -was not some leftwing columnist. This is the former Navy general counsel. Alberto Mora. Retired Air Force MAJ Matthew Alexander led the interrogation team that tracked down Abu Musab alZarqawi. the leader of alQaida in Iraq. He used legal and traditional interrogation tactics which he believes are. more effective than torture. Here is what Major Alexander said: I listened time and time again to foreign fighters. and Sunni Iraqis. state that the number one reason they decided to pick up arms and join Al Qaeda was the abuses at Abu Ghraib and the authorized torture and abuse at Guantanamo Bay .... Its no exaggeration to say that at least half of our losses and casualties in that country have come at the hands of foreigners who joined the fray because of our program of detainee abuse. Let me remind those listening again. the source of this quote is not some liberalleaning columnist. angry at policies of the United States. It is MAJ Matthew Alexander from the Air Force. a man who dedicated a large part of his life to serving our country and risking his life in its defense. I visited Guantanamo in 2006. I left with a feeling of pride and admiration for the soldiers and sailors serving there. They are great Americans doing a tough job in a very bleak climate. But they are being asked to carry a heavy burden created by the previous administrations policies. which have turned Guantanamo. sadly. into a recruiting poster for alQaida. By 2006. even former President George W. Bush said he wanted to close Guantanamo Bay. He acknowledged the problem. He didnt do anything to solve it. As an aside. it is interesting to note that there were no complaints from the Republican side of the aisle whenPresident Bush said he wanted to close Guantanamo. The Republican leader of the Senate did not come down to the floor to object when his President made thd suggestion. He started making a regular trip to the floor to object when the suggestion was made by President Obama. President Obama has shown courag6 in taking on this difficult challenge. Within 48 hours of his inauguration. President Obama issued executive orders prohibiting torture. stating that Guantanamo will be closed within I year and setting up a review process for all detainees who are currently held at Guantanamo. Here is what President Obama said: The United States intends to prosecute the ongoing struggle against violence and terrorism and we are going to do so vigilantly. we are going to do so effectively. and we are going to do so in a manner that is consistent with our values and our ideals. At the signing of the Executive orders. the President was joined by 16 retired admirals and generals. These distinguished Americans issued a statement saying: President Obama& actions today will restore the moral authority and strengthen the national security of the United States ... President Obama has rejected the false choice between national security and our ideals. Our Nation will be stronger and safer for it. In response to the Executive orders. Republican Senators JOHN MCCAIN andLINDSEY GRAHAM said: We support President Obamas decision to close the prison at Guantanamo. reaffirm Americas adherence to the Geneva Conventions. and begin a process that will. we hope. lead to the resolution of all cases of Guantaname detainees. Keep in mind. I have just read a Quote from Senator JOHN MCCAIN. a man who. of course. was President Obamas opponent in the last election. but a man who had a personal life experience of over 5 years of captivity during the Vietnam war. and a colleague of mine who has shown extraordinary courage and political courage and leadership in leading the effort to say. once and for all. that we were going to prohibit torture as part of Americas policy. It was Senator MCCAIN. along with his colleague Senator GRAHAM. who said these supportive .things after President Obamas announcement. It was a strong bipartisan statement. a strong day f~r our country. But now things have changed. and I do not know why. The Republicans are on the attack. They claim that the President does not have a plan to close Guantanamo. and yet at the same time they are arguing that the President does have a plan. which is to release terrorists into the United States. Imagine that. These claims are notonly contradictory. they are preposterous. The truth is. the President is taking the time to carefully plan for the closure of Guantanamo. and he is going to do it in a way that is consistent with Americas security. Here is how the Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair explained it: [Guantanamo] is a rallying cry for terrorist recruitment and harmful to our national security. so closing itis important for our national security. The guiding principles for closing the center should be protecting our national security. respecting the Geneva Conventions and the rule of law. and respecting the existing institutions of justice in this country. Closing this center and satisfying these principles will take time. and is the work of many departments and agencies. In recent weeks. Republicans have regularly come to the floor of the Senate and the House to make dozens of statements criticizing President Obama on Guantanamo. The distinguished minority leader. Senator MCCONNELL of Kentucky. alone. has spoken on this issue on 9 separate occasions over the last 11 days the Senate has been in session. It is interesting that the Republicans are spending so much time focused on the fate of Guantanamo while President ObaMa and others in Congress are focused on get-. ting our economy back on track after 8 years of failed economic policies. What -is the explanation? According to a recent story in Politico: Congressional Republicans have stoked parochial fears of releasing Guantanamo detainees to the U.S. mainland. and GOP aides privately acknowledge that this issue is one of the few on which they believe they have a real edge on the Obama administration. Somehow arguing on the floor of the Senate that President Barack Obama cannot wait to close Guantanamo and turn terrorists loose in the United Statesincredible. The Hill newspaper reported: . As polls show most Americans approve of the job Obama is doing on issues like the economy. the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and others. Republicans are desperate to find an issue on which they can come out ahead. In other words. the Republicans are trying to turn Guantanamo into a political issue. Richard Clarke was President George W. Bushs first counterterrorism chief. Listen to what he said last week: Recent Republican attacks on Guantanamo are more desperate attempts from a demoralized party to politicize national security and the safety of the American people. Lets examine two of the specific claims from the other sideof the aisle. They argue that transferring Guantanamo detainees to U.S. prisons will put Americans at risk. Well. earlier today my colleague SHELDON WHITEHOUSEI serve on the Judiciary Committee with himhad a very interesting hearing. which I am sure will be noted by many people when they follow the news. where he talked about the detention and interrogation policies and brought some critical witnesses to testify who had dissented from President Bushs policies during the course of his administration. During his hearing in the Judiciary Committee today. one of the witnesses was Phillip Zelikow. Phillip Zelikow was the Executive Director of the 9/11 Commission. which has received high marks from virtually everyone for the professional job they did under the leadership of Governor Kean of New Jersey and former Congressman Hamilton of Indiana. Mr. Zelikow also served as counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.-He comes to this issue with ample experience. Mr. Zelikow was intimately involved with these issues during the Bush administration. and he strongly. supports closing Guantanamo. He told mein the hearing it will be safe to transfer Guantanamo detainees to U.S. prisons and facilities. and some of the most dangerous terrorists are already incarcerated in the United States. Here are a few examples: Ramzi Yousef. the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade. Center bombingshe is being safely and securely held in an American detention facility. 9/11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui. Richard Reid. the socalled shoe bomber. and numerous alQaida terrorists responsible for bombing United States Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. If we can safely hold these individuals. I believe we can safely hold any Guantanamo detainees who need to be held. I should note no prisoner has ever escaped from a Federal supermaximum security facility in the United States. -Republicans also claim the administration wants to release terrorists into our communities. What an incredible charge. and patently false. President Obama has made clear that Guantanamo will be closed in a manner consistent with our national security. Even the Bush administration acknowledged that there are people being held at Guantanamo who were wrongly detained and who are not terrorists. Let me give you one example. There is an attorney in Chicago who is a friend of mine who volunteered to represent one of the detainees at Guantanamo. At his own expense. he flies down to Guantanamo and meets with this man periodically. He tells me that the man is now 26 years old. He is originally from Gaza. He has been held now for 7 years7 years--because at the time we were offering rewards to people in various parts of the world who would turn in suspects. So the money was offered. This man was turned in. eventually sent to Guantanamo. The attorney tells me he was sent to Guantanamo at the age of 19. He is now 26. Fifteen months ago. our Government sent a message to this attorney saying: We have reviewed this case in. detailafter 6 yearsreviewed this case in detail. We have no charges against this man being held in detention. This man is being held in Guantanamo. which is a very bleak setting if you have been there. and he has now been held an additional 15 months with no pending charges."" Our Government did not believe he is a dangerous individual. What they were trying to do is to find a place where he can go and. for 15 months. he has been sitting in detention in Guantanamo. Is that consistent with .justice in America? Is that the kind of image we want? Of course we want to be safe. But the rule of law suggests that if the man has done nothing wrong. he should not be punished for it and continue to be In this secure setting in Guantanamo. separated from his family now foi 7 years. with no charges brought against him. Even the Bush administration. which started this Guantanamo detention. realized after some time that literally hundreds of people who were detained there were not in any way. shape. or form a threat to the United States and they were releasedmany of them back to their home countries. Back in 2002. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld described the detainees at Guantanamo as ""the hardest of the hard core"" and ""among the most dangerous. best trained. vicious killers on the face of the Earth."" Those are the words of Secretary Rumsfeld. However. since that statement by Secretary Rumsfeld. two out of three of the detainees in Guantanamo have been released. They have also cleared dozens of additional detainees for release but cannot return -them to their home countries. much like the one I described. because of the risk they may be tortured if they return. We need our allies to accept some of these detainees. but they have made it clear they will not do so unless the United States admits a small number of detainees who do not present any threat to our country. As Senator SESSIONS. the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee. has pointed out. it is illegal under U.S. law to resettle terrorists in the United States_one of the charges being made on the Republican side of the aisle. Unlike the previous administration. President Obama does not believe that he can set aside any laws enacted by Congress. No one can be admitted to this country to live freely until they have been through a thorough background and security check and cleared of wrongdoing. President Obama inherited the Guantanamo mess from the previous administration. Solving this problem is not easy. There will be difficult choices. and it will take time. But the President has shown he is willing to step up and lead and make hard decisions that are in the best interests of the security of the United States. I applaud the President for engaging in a careful and deliberative process to close Guantanamo. As Colin Powell. James Baker. JOHN MCCAIN. and many military officials have said. closing Guantanamo will make us a safer nation. I urge foy Republican colleagues to take another look at this issue and understand that this important national security issue is best solved in a bipartisan way. and that we should continue the work of closing Guantanamo. suggested by President George W. Bush. by doing it in a fashion that is consistent with Americas values. Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.",111118321,DURBIN,RICHARD,S,IL,M,D,,voting,2009-05-13,96,Mr. DURBIN,5264,5742,05132009.txt,16065,2685,111,2009,mr presid last sever week hue cri side aisl steadi

1110043307,Mr. Speaker. the crazy capandtax idea advanced by my liberal colleagues would create $640 billion in new taxes on American businesses and raise electrical bills by $3.100 per household per year. This capandtax proposal creates an artificial market to find revenue to pa. for various social programs that this administration plans to enact. such as government takeover of our health care. This boondoggle will cap* our growth and trade our jobs. Companies looking to invest in our economy Will simply move overseas to escape this enormous tax increase. You dont believe me? Look ii the crystal ball at Spain. which has been on this plan for 10 years. After losing a number of companies. seeing utility prices skyrocket and suffering a 17.5 percent unemployment rate. we can see our future clearly. Even worse. experts tell us that capandtax will do nothing to cap greenhouse gases. but it will put the United States at a. global economic disadvantage becauseChina! and India will ignore this scheme. In fact. it will also serve as an economic stimulus for all developing countries which will be happy to accept our jobs.

1110032444,"Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker. I would like to start off by. first of all. saying. and I comment on this a lot. I have tremendous respect for the chairman of the Budget Committee. Mr. SPRATT. He is an admirable man who has a very difficult job. I would like to hearken back to a day where bipartisanship on the budget worked. the year before I came into Congress. and Mr. SPRATTr was a key part of this. That was the 1997 budget agreement. That is when reconciliation was used for its intended purpose. In that 1997 budget agreement. where you had a Democratic President and a Republican House. they came together in bipartisan fashion to reduce spending and to reduce taxes. and it is that budget agreement that paved the way for the surpluses that then occurred and followed that helped us pay down debt. The fact is. Madam Speaker. that both parties should claim credit for that job and that improvement in our fiscal situation. for bringing those surpluses. for balancing the budget and for having a substantial contribution to debt reduction. Both parties did that. Both parties should get credit for that But here we are today. taking this process that has been used to good effect in the past. fulfilling the spirit of the process. and we are just turning it upside down. "" Lets review the contents of this. We very well might have. with as little as 35 hours of debate between the two Chambers and no more than 105 hours of debate because of this fasttrack procedure. the greatest transformation of our Federal Government since the New Deal. Lets review the issues. Taxes: What this budget proposes to do is to impose a new national energy tax on everybody who consumes energy: a tax on manufacturing. a tax on coalburning States like my own. a tax that is bad for our economy. Higher taxes on small businesses. Higher taxes on investments. Higher taxes in a recession. We proposed an alternative in our budget. We said. no. lets not raise taxes in a recession. Lets make our businesses more competitive in the global economy so we can create jobs in this recession. That was rejected. Now there they are steamrolling these tax increases through with very little debate and very few amendments. Lets talk about capandtrade. The chairman gave an articulate defense for how capandtrade is not happening here. It is not in this budget. Well. then why on Earth is the Commerce Committee marking up capandtrade legislation next week? They are having hearings right now. and they are marking this bill up next week. and they are bringing it to the floor. Here is the problem with capandtrade. We dont think it works. Even if you think you have a carbon problem. hitting our economy with this while our very competitors in China and India wont do it will not even reduce carbon in the atmosphere. It will actually increase carbon. but from China and India. For every one ton of greenhouse gases we reduce in America. China increases theirs by three or four .tons. We lose our manufacturing jobs. They get the jobs. They emit carbon in the atmosphere. There is more carbon in the atmosphere and America has fewer jobs. How is that a good idea? We proposed an alternative in our budget. We said lets drill for oil and gas in our own country. where we have a lot of it. and lets invest the proceeds of it in a clean energy trust fund so we innovate our way toward a clean energy system. so we innovate our way for nuclear. clean coal. renewables. biomass. wind. solar. all these things. fuel cells. Americans are innovators. Lets not hit ourselves with a huge energy tax that costs jobs. Lets innovate our way out of this problem through a cleaner energy economy. That is our alternative. That was rejected. Now this capandtrade thing could get swept through with as little as 35 hours of debate. Lets talk about health care. I just eame from the Ways and Means Committee. another committee I serve on. before coming to the -floor here today. where they are discussing how in the budget reconciliation they are going to have a new health care plan that has a governmentrun plan option. The problem with the governmentrun plan option is it quickly becomes a governmentrun plan monopoly. One of the leading health insurance actuaries in America. the Lewin Group. is telling us that as many as 120 million Americans would lose their private health insurance under this governmentrun plan option. This is governmentrun health care. It may not say it in name. it may not be what it says it is going to do tomorrow. but it is clearly what all the actuaries and the economists are telling us what it becomes. The advocates in the Ways and Means Committee are already telling us. why have private health insurance in the first place? Lets just have the government run it all. So clearly the intention is being made known. and this confiscation of 17 percent of our economy will run through Congress with as little as 35 hours of debate. This is what we are talking about. Should we have a government takeover of health care in America? Lets have a debate about that. Lets not have 35 hours of debate. Should we impose the largest energy tax in the history of this country on our manufacturers. on seniors. on the upper Midwest where we have cold winters. or should we just ram this thing through with 35 hours of debate? Should we hit our economy in the middle of a recession with the largest tax increase in history. ram it through with no amendments with as little as 35 hours of debate? Should we transform the Federal Government. the largest transformation we have seen since the New Deal. with as little as 35 hours of debate? We think no. And we agree with the Democrats in the Senate who agree with us that the answer should be no. Lets concur with the Senate Democrats.

1110003138,Madam President. S. 22. the Omnibus Public Land Management Act. includes five bills vital for increasing our Nations understanding of our oceans. Great Lakes. and coastal areas. The ocean bills included in this package are all strong bipartisan pieces of legislation that were favorably reported by the Senate Commerce Committee in the 110th Congress and passed the House of Representatives. The oceans cover twothirds of our planet. yet we know little about what lies beneath them or how the changing climate is affecting marine resources. Millions of Americans depend directly and indirectly on healthy and bountiful oceans. In 2007. our Nations coastal economies contributed nearly 50 percent. or $6.7 trillion. to the national gross domestic product. While our Nation relies on our ocean. Great Lakes. and coastal resources. tremendous gaps exist in our knowledge of these ecosystems. The Senate Commerce Committee provisions included in S. 22 will strengthen and improve our marine. coastal. and. scientific programs. and will help us make the best possible decisions about how to manage. conserve. and protectthese valuable resources. The Ocean Exploration and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA. Undersea Research Program Act. included in this package. will give us a better understanding of our marine ecosystems and resources. This legislation reflects a long history of bipartisan collaboration in the Senate. It passed the Senate by unanimous consent in the both the 108th and 109th Congresses and was reported favorably in the 110th Congress by the Commerce Committee. The provision establishes an interdisciplinary ocean exploration program to gather observations and data from areas in the ocean we have previously been unable to explore. In addition. this legislation would help strengthen and coordinate NOAAs National Undersea Research Program. The National Undersea Research Program seeks to increase scientific knowledge for the management. use. and preservation of ocean. Great Lakes. and coastal resources through undersea research. exploration. education. and technology development. These essential activities are imperative given that approximately 95 percent of the ocean floor remains unexplored. Ocean exploration and undersea research provides unprecedented opportunities to discover items of natural. cultural. and economic value including new sources of minerals. drugs. habitats. species. artifacts. and shipwrecks. The Ocean and Coastal Mapping Integration Act included in S. 22 would integrate Federal and coastal mapping activities throughout the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. Approximately 90 percent of our Nations maritime territory remains unmapped by modern technology. Improved mapping of our Nations coastal and ocean waters will increase our understanding of the marine environment. thereby increasing the safety of navigation in our maritime domain. supporting national security missions of the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard. and allowing for better management of marine ecosystems and resources. This bill also has a longstanding history of broad bipartisan support in both the Senate and House. The Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation System Act would build on current regional systems to establish a national integrated ocean. Great Lakes. and coastal observing system to collect. compile. and make available data to support marine commerce. weather. climate. and marine forecasting. energy siting and production. navigation. ecosystembased resource management. and public safety. The legislation passed the Senate by unanimous consent in both the 108th and 109th Congresses. During the 110th Congress. the legislation passed the House and was reported favorably by the Senate Commerce Committee. The Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act in S. 22 mandates that steps be taken to understand and address climate change and its impacts on our oceans. a much needed and important action. Over the past 200 years. human activities have resulted in dramatic increases in greenhouse gases that are altering the Earths climate. The oceans mitigate the effects of global warming by absorbing approximately half of all this atmospheric carbon dioxide. However. as the oceans absorb more carbon dioxide. their chemistry is changing and the oceans are becoming more acidic. The Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act would establish an interagency committee to develop a strategic research plan on ocean acidification and establish an ocean acidification program within NOAA to conduct research and longterm monitoring on our acidifying oceans and to develop adaptation strategies and techniques for conserving marine ecosystems. This legislation represents a bipartisan effort to promote climate change research and adaptation activities. The bill was reported favorably by the Senate Commerce Committee and passed the House in the 110th Congress. The final oceans bill included in S. 22 is the Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program Act. As the U.S. population grows and more people move to the coasts. our coastal lands and ecosystems are threatened by unsustainable development. This legislation authorizes NOAA to award competitive grants to coastal States. including the Great Lakes. to protect coastal and estuarine areas which have significant conservation. recreation. ecological. historic. or watershed protection value and are threatened by conversion to other uses. As chairman of the Commerce Committee during the. 110th Congress. I was pleased to favorably report these important ocean .policy bills. Unfortunately. we were unable to pass these bills last Congress. I am glad that the Senate is considering their passage as one of the first major pieces of legislation in the 111th Congress. Our oceans. Great Lakes. and coasts provide many environmental and economic benefits to our Nation. and their conservation must be one of our highest national priorities.,111116401,INOUYE,DANIEL,S,HI,M,D,,voting,2009-01-15,422,Mr. INOUYE,20662,20840,01152009.txt,5975,879,111,2009,madam presid omnibu public land manag act includ five bill vital increas nation understand ocean great lake coastal area ocean bill includ packag strong bipartisan piec legisl favor report senat commerc committe th congress pass hous repres ocean cover twothird planet yet know littl lie beneath chang climat affect marin resourc million american depend directli indirectli healthi bounti ocean nation coastal economi contribut nearli percent trillion nation gross domest product nation reli ocean great lake coastal resourc tremend gap exist knowledg ecosystem senat commerc committe provis includ strengthen improv marin coastal scientif program help us make best possibl decis manag conserv valuabl resourc ocean explor nation ocean atmospher administr noaa undersea research program act includ packag give us better understand marin ecosystem resourc legisl reflect long histori bipartisan collabor senat pass senat unanim consent th th congress report favor th congress commerc committe provis establish interdisciplinari ocean explor program gather observ data area ocean previous unabl explor addit legisl would help strengthen coordin noaa nation undersea research program nation undersea research program seek increas scientif knowledg manag use preserv ocean great lake coastal resourc undersea research explor educ technolog develop essenti activ imper given approxim percent ocean floor remain unexplor ocean explor undersea research provid unpreced opportun discov item natur cultur econom valu includ new sourc miner drug habitat speci artifact shipwreck ocean coastal map integr act includ would integr feder coastal map activ throughout us exclus econom zone approxim percent nation maritim territori remain unmap modern technolog improv map nation coastal ocean water increas understand marin environ therebi increas safeti navig maritim domain support nation secur mission us navi coast guard allow better manag marin ecosystem resourc bill also longstand histori broad bipartisan support senat hous integr coastal ocean observ system act would build current region system establish nation integr ocean great lake coastal observ system collect compil make avail data support marin commerc weather climat marin forecast energi site product navig ecosystembas resourc manag public safeti legisl pass senat unanim consent th th congress th congress legisl pass hous report favor senat commerc committe feder ocean acidif research monitor act mandat step taken understand address climat chang impact ocean much need import action past year human activ result dramat increas greenhous gase alter earth climat ocean mitig effect global warm absorb approxim half atmospher carbon dioxid howev ocean absorb carbon dioxid chemistri chang ocean becom acid feder ocean acidif research monitor act would establish interag committe develop strateg research plan ocean acidif establish ocean acidif program within noaa conduct research longterm monitor acidifi ocean develop adapt strategi techniqu conserv marin ecosystem legisl repres bipartisan effort promot climat chang research adapt activ bill report favor senat commerc committe pass hous th congress final ocean bill includ coastal estuarin land conserv program act us popul grow peopl move coast coastal land ecosystem threaten unsustain develop legisl author noaa award competit grant coastal state includ great lake protect coastal estuarin area signific conserv recreat ecolog histor watersh protect valu threaten convers use chairman commerc committe th congress pleas favor report import ocean polici bill unfortun unabl pass bill last congress glad senat consid passag one first major piec legisl th congress ocean great lake coast provid mani environment econom benefit nation conserv must one highest nation prioriti,547,TRUE
1110056231,"Madam Speaker. I rise to support and discuss regulations I included in the American Clean Energy and Security Act to prevent excessive energy speculation. which has played a role in the run away energy prices we saw last year. and are seeing in the first half of 2009.. In January. oil was trading at $35 per barrel. Today. it is trading near $70 per barrel. The price for oil has doubled in the midst of a global recession. Oil supplies are at a 20year high. and demand is at a 10year low. yet oil prices have skyrocketed since the beginning of the year. If this is based on supply and demand. what is happening to explain rising oil prices? If supply is up and demand is down during this global recession. why would oil continue to climb? The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. the Senate. as well as a number of respected oil market traders and analysts. have pointed to excessive speculation in the energy markets as the primary reason we see price spikes and volatility in the marketplace. In May. I introduced the Prevent Unfair Manipulation of Prices Act. or the PUMP Act of 2009. I worked with Energy and Commerce Chairman WAXMAN and Subcommittee Chairman MARKEY to include the bulk of my bill into the American Clean Energy and Security Act. which is on the floor today. This legislation is not new. I have been introducing this bill in one form or another since April 2006. But new weaknesses in our regulatory structure. brought to light by the financial crisis and spikes in the price of oil last year. are addressed in the 2009 PUMP Act. The need for this legislation is two fold: 1. the dramatic rise in prices of oil and natural gas. and 2. the new carbon derivatives trading market created by the ACES bill. Some object to the inclusion of regulations on derivatives in this energy bill. I believe ACES proposed capandtrade program is fatally flawed without strong regulations to police this market from runaway price swings on carbon. Addressing excessive energy speculation should be a key part of any new energy policy pursued. because a dramatic spike in oil prices or carbon -prices. would further devastate our already weakened economy. Acdording to NYMEX officials. less than ViO of one percent of futures trades in crude oil ever result in physical delivery. Most futures traders are not interested in delivery of a product. they are interested in profit. When speculators increase their investments. physical hedgersbusinesses like airlines. trucking companies. and other industries that actually use the energy being tradedrepresent a smaller and smaller portion of the market. They are being squeezed out! As a growing majority of the market is controlled by speculators. crude oil is morphed from a commodity into a financial asset. traded for its financial value instead of its energy value! As a result. this excessive speculation by index speculators is a significant factor in the price Americans are paying for gasoline. diesel- and home heating oil. and has similar ""affects on agricultural prices. For too long. through loopholes. exemptions. and poor enforcement by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. energy speculaJors bave -been able to avoid position limits: As a result. excessive speculation has exploded. My legislation in the 2009 PUMP Act and in ACES is comprehensive. and changes the regulations for the energy markets in fundamental ways. It makes the Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulate all overthecounter trades that are currently not regulated. it regulates foreign boards of trades energy transactions that trade for delivery in the United States or on a computer located in the United States. These boards aresubject to the same regulations as current markets. including large trader reporting. recordkeeping. and prohibitions against fraud and market manipulation. My bill closes the swapsloophole. no longer allowing energy transactions to be excluded from the requirements of the Commodity Exchange Act. This would require the CFTC to provide greater oversight over these swap transactions. It bans naked credit default swaps. Naked credit default swaps. or one where the holder has no risk obligation on the swap. which creates a moral hazard by incentivizing economic loss. It sets aggregate position limits for energy speculators across all markets. it includes a CFTC Inspector General provision that makes that office independent and accountable. It also requires all trades be cleared through a designated clearing organization. eliminating the unregulated ""dark markets."" My bill allows the CFTC to collect fees and create an independent funding stream for oversight and enforcement of commodity markets. Finally. it includes carbon derivatives as a regulated energy commodities under the authority of the CFTC. This incorporates all greenhouse gas emissions. offsets. and financial products derived from carbon credits. As the House works on the ACES bill. it is important that carbon trading not lead to a speculative bubble like we saw in the 2008 oil markets. Congress needs to pass legislation to set strong position limits. and ensure that excessive speculation does not allow speculators to detach carbon or energy prices from supply and demand fundamentals. I am committed to continuing to work with my colleagues in passing legislation for the President to sign that sets strong position limits and improves CFTC enforcement to end this excessive speculation and provide relief to American consumers.",111116100,STUPAK,BART,H,MI,M,D,1,voting,2009-06-26,597,Mr. STUPAK,57552,57681,06262009.txt,5490,883,111,2009,madam speaker rise support discuss regul includ american clean energi secur act prevent excess energi specul play role run away energi price saw last year see first half januari oil trade per barrel today trade near per barrel price oil doubl midst global recess oil suppli year high demand year low yet oil price skyrocket sinc begin year base suppli demand happen explain rise oil price suppli demand global recess would oil continu climb feder energi regulatori commiss senat well number respect oil market trader analyst point excess specul energi market primari reason see price spike volatil marketplac may introduc prevent unfair manipul price act pump act work energi commerc chairman waxman subcommitte chairman markey includ bulk bill american clean energi secur act floor today legisl new introduc bill one form anoth sinc april new weak regulatori structur brought light financi crisi spike price oil last year address pump act need legisl two fold dramat rise price oil natur ga new carbon deriv trade market creat ace bill object inclus regul deriv energi bill believ ace propos capandtrad program fatal flaw without strong regul polic market runaway price swing carbon address excess energi specul key part new energi polici pursu dramat spike oil price carbon price would devast alreadi weaken economi nymex offici less vio one percent futur trade crude oil ever result physic deliveri futur trader interest deliveri product interest profit specul increas invest physic like airlin truck compani industri actual use energi smaller smaller portion market squeez grow major market control specul crude oil morph commod financi asset trade financi valu instead energi valu result excess specul index specul signific factor price american pay gasolin diesel home heat oil similar affect agricultur price long loophol exempt poor enforc commod futur trade commiss energi bave abl avoid posit limit result excess specul explod legisl pump act ace comprehens chang regul energi market fundament way make commod futur trade commiss regul overthecount trade current regul regul foreign board trade energi transact trade deliveri unit state comput locat unit state board regul current market includ larg trader report recordkeep prohibit fraud market manipul bill close longer allow energi transact exclud requir commod exchang act would requir cftc provid greater oversight swap transact ban nake credit default swap nake credit default swap one holder risk oblig swap creat moral hazard incentiv econom loss set aggreg posit limit energi specul across market includ cftc inspector gener provis make offic independ account also requir trade clear design clear organ elimin unregul dark market bill allow cftc collect fee creat independ fund stream oversight enforc commod market final includ carbon deriv regul energi commod author cftc incorpor greenhous ga emiss offset financi product deriv carbon credit hous work ace bill import carbon trade lead specul bubbl like saw oil market congress need pass legisl set strong posit limit ensur excess specul allow specul detach carbon energi price suppli demand fundament commit continu work colleagu pass legisl presid sign set strong posit limit improv cftc enforc end excess specul provid relief american consum,513,TRUE

1110022324,Mr. Speaker. while our Nation is suffering a severe economic recession. the Democrat majority is working behind closed doors to enact the largest carbon regulatory scheme in our Nations history in the form of a capandtax system. In fact. President Obamas budget includes a $646 billion capandtrade energy tax that will be paid by every American who drives a car. turns on a light switch. or buys a product made in the United States. And thats every single American. regardless of income. No matter how you slice it. this issue is a huge tax. Government revenues are. of course. taxes on the American people. This capandtax scheme would cost the average American household in every State up to $3.000 a year. and thats a very conservative estimate. This is really not a good way to stimulate our economy in economic bad times like we are in. I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to reject the flawed capandtax program in the Presidents budget.

1110060291,"Mr. Speaker. this motion the ""Defund to recommit is critical at this time. As many people in this body realize. the scandals surrounding the criminal activities of ACORN have called into question their role in all aspects of government. including aspects covered in this bill. The funding theyve received under Health and Human Services. title IV. which is covered in this bill. and other areas make it extremely important that we consider it at this time. ACORN. as our committee had previously reported. is an organization with a long history of criminal indictments and activities. so much so that in fact the Census Bureau has. on its own. removed its funding. The Senate has voted 837 to remove funding. we must do the same thing. This motion to recommit deliberately is here because in fact this is a fundingrelated activity. This is one in which we understand that the very fundamental of taxpayer dollars being properly used and supported is at stake. There is no question as to where ACORN stands. where the administration and multiple Governors. including my own Governor. Arnold Schwarzenegger. have called for this investigation. 130 Members of this body have called on the President in fact to defund. So the motion to recommit. narrow in scope. simply makes the defunding of ACORN a portion of this bill. makes it clear that the Members of this House do not support ACORNs activities. including child trafficking. prostitution. and in fact a great many other criminal activities. including voter fraud. This is timely. it is targeted. and it is time that this House act. I move the motion. and ask for it to be voted positively. Mr. Speaker. this motion to recommit is simple. Its about protecting students and taxpayers. Earlier this week. more than 130 House Republicans wrote to President Obama requesting that he take immediate action to cut off all federal funding of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now. or ACORN. ACORN has been linked to multiple instances of voter registration fraud and other illicit activity. In recent days. media accounts have detailed ACORN employees alleged complicity in illegal schemes too unseemly to discuss in this chamber. To continue funding this organization would not just be indefensibleit would be an outrage. An analysis of federal data shows that ACORN has received more than $53 million in direct funding from the Federal Government since 1994. and has likely received substantially more indirectly through States and localities that receive Federal block grants. The Census Bureau recently decided to sever all ties with ACORN to ensure the integrity of their operations. This was the right decision. Unfortunately. ACORNs links to the Federal Government do not stop with the Census Bureau. This organization has infiltrated a host of federal programs. consuming taxpayer dollars even as it has repeatedly been found to engage in criminal activity. To fully protect taxpayers. we must enact a comprehensive ban on Federal funding for this corrupt and criminal organization. This motion to recommit will do exactly that. Republicans have introduced legislationthe Defund ACORN Actto put an immediate stop to Federal funding for this crooked bunch. U.S. International Agreements: The iron and steel section states: ""This section shall be applied in a manner consistent with United States obligations under international agreements."" This applies governmentwide. Any and all Federal agencies: Section 505(a) is open to other entities the Secretary deems appropriatean openended inclusion that could apply to any Federal agency. The tentacles of this legislation reach into the economy. our education system. our workforce system. and a host of other areas. It is truly a comprehensive billand a comprehensive ban on funding for ACORN. such as that included in this motion. is what is needed. Mr. Speaker.

1110010839,"Mr. President. this amendment is based on my Community Revitalization Energy"" Conservation Act. S. 222. and I am very pleased to be joined by the Senator from Michigan in offering it. This amendment will address our energy and economic challenges while putting Americans to work. Supporting energy efficiency improvements to Americas homes and businesses is one of the smartest ways we can face these challenges to create jobs and reduce our energy consumption. The goal of this amendment is to decrease energy consumption. create green jobs. and increase the number of energy efficient projects by reducing the significant cost barriers. such as the prohibitive upfront costs to homeowners and businesses who want to make improvements to their homes and buildings. Aggressively- pursuing energy efficiency will help put us on a path toward energy security. Presently. buildings account for 40 percent of total U.S. energy consumption and 70 percent of U.S. electricity consumption. In order for us to decrease our reliance on fossilbased fuels. this has to change. We can achieve 20 to 30 percent energy reduction through better insulation. lighting. and HVAC equipment and controls. Potentially. we have the opportunity to save over $200 billion through building efficiency alone. The economic recovery package increases the bond limit for the Qualified Energy Conservation Bond Program. which supports conservation upgrades to buildings. It does that by taking that number from $800 million to $3.2 billion. I support this provision. and the FeingoldStabenow amendment builds on it by modifying the Qualified Energy Conservation Bond Program to include conservation in private buildings using a financing mechanism that would eliminate the prohibitive upfront costs of energy efficiency improvements between homeowners and businesses. Meanwhile. the amendment would allow State and local governments to promote energy efficiency products by use of electric and water utilities as intermediaries. By using utilities as intermediaries. homeowners and businesses incur no upfront costs and they can then gradually pay back the cost of the energy efficiency retrofits through their electricity or water bills at a rate that does not exceed what they have historically paid. For example. if a monthly water bill before improvements is $150. and with the improvement the energy costs are down to $110. at most a homeowner or business would pay $40 more monthly toward paying off the cost of the energy efficiency building retrofits which were made possible by this program. This has worked. Already several States and cities. including Hawaii. Michigan. Berkeley. CA. and Babylon. NY. are beginning to tackle the issue of energy efficiency in residential buildings. In my home State of Wisconsin. efforts are already underway in Milwaukee to use this novel financing mechanism to promote energy efficiency. In partnership with the Center on Wisconsin Strategy. the city is pursuing Me2.. or the Milwaukee Energy Efficiency Program. Initial estimates from the Center on Wisconsin Strategy suggest that if you could retrofit nearly all of the existing housing stock in Milwaukee. an initial investment of just under $250 million. it could result in annual energy savings of over $80 million. All of these efforts to conserve energy require investments in time and money. By combining .efforts on two of our greatest challenges. energy and employment. we can create a great opportunity. Energy efficiency and conservation are. of course. in our national interest for our longterm economic wellbeing. for the health and safety of our citizens and the world as we mitigate the effects of climate change. and for our independence and security as well. This amendment is endorsed by many key groups. including the Apollo Alliance. the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy. Air Conditioning Contractors of America. National Electrical Contractors Association. and the PlumbingHeatingCooling Contractors National Association. I thank the Senator from Montana. Senator BAUCUS. for working with me on this amendment and for his support on the amendment. I urge my all of my colleagues to support it.

1110057201,Thats the money that we reinvest back into those costsaving measures. that we reinvest back into preventive care so that kids will have dental. kids will have oral. which could be the same thing. Kids will have hearing checkups. All of these things will be included for young kids. Vision. These are all things that. as we save this money and steer it back into the front end of this program. we are going to have healthier citizens. Now I was reading an article last night that hit me about energy. and it also makes a good point about health care. We are in a direct competition. Mr. Speaker. with China. I dont think anybody will deny that. I think we all know that we are in a direct competition with Asia and with China. In China they lose 400.000 people a year. who die because of the air pollution in China. So the point on the energy bill is. they are clearly not doing enough. At some point those people are going to say. We want clean air. And once we jump ahead in the energy field and start making these products and exporting them to China. we now have created a massive export market. But the philosophy is different because we are saying that our values. our priorities here are about putting the money on the front end. making sure everybodys covered. This chart here. the difference in the $6.000 that we spend per citizen and the $3.000 and some change that Canada. France and Germany spend and have a higher life expectancy is because they cover everyone. They allow people to get preventive care so theyre healthier. so that they can go to work. so that they dont miss weeks at a time of work. They get the prescription. and they can go back to work. I mean. we heard a lot over the last decade or two about family values. What is a deeper value than the health of your kids and the health of our families? There is not one. Because if you dont have health. you dont even have happiness. There are very few unhealthy happy people. When you are unhealthy. you are unhappy. So this is fundamental to the values that we have as a country. It will unleash a level of productivity in this country. All of the anxiety that people have will be channeled and unleashed into more positive endeavors and at the same time begin to move us in a direction where we are not going to bankrupt the country. We are going to make the country healthier. more productive. create more wealth and at the same time contain our health care costs. which will probably end up saving us a lot of money in Medicare. I mean. one of the things that people forget is. all of these people who dont have health care that are older. that think. Im going to wait until I get on Medicare. and then once they get on Medicare. the problem is exacerbated. The cancer has spread. and a variety of other problems ensue. So this is an opportunity for us to say that as we try to compete in a global marketplace. we have the opportunity to enhance the intellect. the productivity and the health of our citizens.,111121170,RYAN,TIM,H,OH,M,D,17,voting,2009-07-15,602,Mr. RYAN of Ohio,20795,20877,07152009.txt,2988,556,111,2009,that money reinvest back costsav measur reinvest back prevent care kid dental kid oral could thing kid hear checkup thing includ young kid vision thing save money steer back front end program go healthier citizen read articl last night hit energi also make good point health care direct competit mr speaker china dont think anybodi deni think know direct competit asia china china lose peopl year die air pollut china point energi bill clearli enough point peopl go say want clean air jump ahead energi field start make product export china creat massiv export market philosophi differ say valu prioriti put money front end make sure everybodi cover chart differ spend per citizen chang canada franc germani spend higher life expect cover everyon allow peopl get prevent care theyr healthier go work dont miss week time work get prescript go back work mean heard lot last decad two famili valu deeper valu health kid health famili one dont health dont even happi unhealthi happi peopl unhealthi unhappi fundament valu countri unleash level product countri anxieti peopl channel unleash posit endeavor time begin move us direct go bankrupt countri go make countri healthier product creat wealth time contain health care cost probabl end save us lot money medicar mean one thing peopl forget peopl dont health care older think im go wait get medicar get medicar problem exacerb cancer spread varieti problem ensu opportun us say tri compet global marketplac opportun enhanc intellect product health citizen,245,TRUE
1110071358,"Mr. President. I thank the Senator from South Dakota for his enthusiasm and passion and ability to explain things. The passion we have seen throughout the day from the Republicans who have spoken is a reflection of the passion we are hearing in our telephone calls and in our emails and in our letters. Our volume is much higher than the 61 percent the CNN poll says. Of course. we wouldnt expect the CNN poll to necessarily reflect our constituents. That enthusiasm across America. that passion. that concern should be reflected in this Chamber. I get a lot of mail and even phone calls from other States. and they say: How come my Senator isnt listening to me? How come he is not listening to all of my friends? Thank you for what you are doing on health care. What we are doing on health care. of course. is asking that it be done step by step so that we can get the confidence of the American people. not do something grandiose that cant be well thought out because it is so big. I spent time as the ranking member of the Health. Education. Labor. and Pensions Committee in an extensive markup on a bill that we had no input in writing. The other side says we had input into the amendments. and we did do some amendments and some were accepted. There were even some that were fairly significant that were accepted. Of course. what was disappointing was that after the August recessthey didnt print it before the August recess because they didnt want people to know what was actually in it at that time. But following the August recess. when they finally printed it. we found out that provisions we had put in by agreement had been ripped out. Never have I had that happen in my 12 years in the U.S. Senate. Then I was part of the Gang of 6the Group of 6. my mother would prefer to call it because she told me never to join a gang. But over a period of at least 60 days. we spent a lot of time and effort from morning until night trying to get a health care bill that would work for America. One of the things we discovered is that it is very extensive. Nobody can comprehend how big health care is in America. We talked about it being 16 percent of the whole economy. Well. does that register with you? We talk about the trillions that are involved. I dont understand trillions. We spend billions around here. but trillions is a whole other level. I dont even think the kids who work on billions understand trillions. When we say 1 trillion. a lot of people say: Well. that is just 1. Well. it is a thousand billion. and a billion is a thousand million. So it is a lot of money. But when we were doing this in this Gang of 6. what we did was kind of divide the issues up into 13 different partsyou might call them steps. We started working through those. Sometimes we would have to leave one because we had basic questions we needed to ask about those sections so we would have a big enough understanding to be able to draft legislation for it. Basic questions. Basic questions. We only made it through slightly more than half the 13 areas before we were faced with a phony deadline. They said September 15 is the dropdead date for this group to finish work. If you dont have it done by then. we will put something together anyway. If you are still getting basic questions answered. dont you think you ought to work on it a little longer and have a few more people in? One of the groups we had in were the Governors. We were going to have a vast expansion of Medicaidnot quite as vast as is in here. and what is in this new bill that we have not yet seen. even though we are quite a ways into this. but a vast expansion of Medicaid. Medicaid works through the States and the States have to pick up part of the costsactually. they pick up a lot of the costs. As we have expanded Medicaid and expanded the rolls on Medicaid. we have put a greater burden not only on the Federal Government. though it is on the Federal Government. too. but also on the State governments. The State governments dont get to vote on it at all. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. who used to be a college president and was also a Secretary of Education. pointed out a number of times that when Governors are faced with this budget crunch on Medicaid. what do they do? Virtually the only place they can cut is universities and colleges. That is why there has been this dramatic increase in college tuitionbecause of what Medicaid has done to the States. Now we are talking about another drastic increase in the number of people in Medicaid. We thought it would be a good idea if we got the Governors on the phonewe hoped the Governors task force on Medicaid would meet with us. and I think they might have. but we were trying to rush it into a short period of time. so we did conference calls. They wanted to know how it was going to affect their States. We knew how many billions it was going to cost as a whole for those States. but we didnt have a breakdown individually. CBO and the Joint Tax Commission dont do breakdowns by States. But we had some people on staffDemocratic staffwho thought they could break that down. and they did. They presented us with these numbers. and I called my Governor and said: I know this is going to be a problem. and I will see what I can do about it. but it is a lot of money. Of course. if I am talking about how much it was for Wyoming. it would not sound nearly as much as for New York. but it is the same kind of percentages. we just have less population. Another surprising thing that happened to us was it looked like Nevada and New York would be hit real hard. The next day we got numbers andwe had the same CBO and Joint Tax score. That didnt change a bit. There was one set of numbers. But the evaluation. the next day. looked a lot better for Nevada and New York. It didnt bring it down enough. so there was a special provision that has been put in the billit was not done in the Gang of 6that made it much nicer for Nevada and New York. We said: Wait a minute. why are you doing that for Nevada and New York? Some of the influential people around here from Nevada and New York said this economy is in a real downturn. and we are being hit harder than anybody else. I said: Well. that is a nice gesture. but this part of the bill isnt going into effect for 4 years. How do we know that in 4 years Nevada and New York are the ones that are going to be hard hit? We ought to have provisions for whoever is hard hit. Those are the kinds of things we were trying to take care of in committee with inadequate numbers. As we worked throughwell. the President wanted to do a speech to the Nation. a joint session speech. They do those over on the House side. and the House and Senate show up for it. It was on health care. Following that health care speech. the next morning we went to the Gang of 6 meeting. I kept notes on what the President said. I had about 12 areas we had tried to draft legislation on that he had pretty specific suggestions on. I had to say: This is something we didnt do. We didnt do this yet. We talked about that for a whole day. Immigration was one of the big ones. Medical malpractice was another. That has been a huge concern to the medical community. I have several things I need to say on this health care bill. I know we are talking in the 30 hours following the appropriations bill. I have things to say about the appropriations bill too. I usually dont talk for very long down here. but I have some of that pentup passion from all the calls and things I have gotten. So I will talk about both spending and health care. I will start with the spending because we just voted for a bill that costs $446.8 billion. and Senators didnt have any opportunity to debate the critical issues within that bill. Of the six bills. threeFinancial Services. LaborHHS. and State and Foreign Opswere airdropped into conference with no opportunity for debate on this floor. So we had no opportunity for consideration. The Transportation bill. the HUD bill. received a 23percent increase over last year. The State and Foreign Ops bill received a 33percent increase over last year. Collectively. the six appropriations bills account for a 12percent increase in Federal spending over last year. Our national deficit for the past fiscal year stands at $1.4 trillion. I dont see that going down at all. Our current unemployment level is at 10 percent. despite the administrations insistence earlier in the year that Congress pass a $1 trillionplus stimulus package. The Senate is currently in the middle of a debate on a health care reform bill that has a 10year implementation cost of $2.5 trillion. Sometime in the next month. we will be forced to raise the Nations debt ceiling for the second time this year to a level that exceeds the current ceiling of $12.1 trillion. The bill makes a number of significant policy changes with respect to the fairness doctrine. This omnibus does not include the fiscal year 2008 ban on Federal funds being used to enforce or implement the socalled fairness doctrine. The bill makes changes to several longstanding policy provisions contained in the Financial Services bill and specifically the District of Columbia section dealing with abortion. medical marijuana. needle exchanges. domestic partners. and the DC Opportunity Scholarships. The bill also contains 5.224 earmarks that total $3.8 billion. Well. let me go into the definition of an earmark. According to the champion of it for many years. Senator MCCAIN. it is not an earmark if you take a specific project to the committee of jurisdiction. where they can debate it and decide whether it is a valid project and how it might fit in with other formulas and things they are already working on. If the committee that actually works that issue approves it. it is not an earmark. But. of course. it has to be put in. in the authorization process. not dropped in by airmail when the conference committee is meeting at the end of the bill. It is considered an earmark when it is just sent to conference. nobody got to debate it and vote on it. and it was shoved into the bill. There are ways special projects can be done and approved by several votes. Normally. it would be the committee of authorization and then the Appropriations Committee and then the floor of the Senate. and that same process would have already been done on the House side because they start all funding bills. So that is probably six or seven votes on an item before it can actually get passed. if it goes through the regular procedure. Of course. it is easier to have somebody to champion it and quietly slip it in without any votes. except a final vote. The final vote is what we are doing right now. It is on the whole package. You cannot pick out a section or an earmark and have a vote on that. Besides that. with 5.224 earmarks. that would take a long time. But it totals $3.8 billion. That is still a lot of money. It has been denigrated since we went into the trilliondollar category. but $3.8 billion is still a lot of money. How is this playing out around the country? I found a blog I hadnt seen before. It kind of speaks to what we are doing in appropriations right now. This is uglytruthstudios.com. It begins: Dont tell me where your priorities are. Show me where you spend your money and I will tell you what they are. That is James W. Frick. who is not the author of this. The author then goes on to say: I was mad when I decided to start this blog and podcast. I was mad about the current state of our congressional spending. I know. I know. a lot of folks are upset about the government and what they spend. My anger starts with the simple fact that they cannot complete the spending process. They havent been able to complete the process. not even one time. since 1999. You can see that this is directed against both sides of the aisle. Folks. you are right to be mad about the out of control spending of the Federal Government. but we all must start with a hard look at how the money is being spent before we can take an honest look at what its being spent on. Take for instance the topic of Healthcare. You will be hard pressed to find a single soul in this country that doesnt think the system needs to be reevaluated. For the last eight plus months we have heard on the morning news. the Sunday talk shows. from congressional leaders. the President of the United States. and even concerned citizens about the impending healthcare crisis. Primetime television has been interrupted for Presidential addresses. The President addressed a joint session of Congress. he held town meetings. he held focus group meetings. he met with members of industry. Congress itself has begged and pleaded for people to not get too excited about their plans. to work with them on putting reform in place. This was a crisis. A crisis that needed to be addressed immediately. the citizens of the United States of America needed to get behind the effort they were putting forth. The media was dominated with the urgency to get something done. Television showed outraged Americans at town hall meetings. Congress exchanged ideas and both sides pointed the finger at the other side trying to show that their side was most in tune with what our country needed. They were on top of this situation. Well they have ""sort of"" been tending to the business of our nations healthcare. The ugly truth though is this: in their rush to be in the media on the Healthcare crisis. Congress has not yet completed the Labor. HHS and Education Appropriation for the 2010 Federal Fiscal year. The House completed their version of the bill on July 27. The Senate has not yet passed a version of the bill. The Senate in all their talk about getting Healthcare done has yet to even take the bill up on the floor for a vote. Well. that part isnt true anymore. It has been finally taken up. It was supposed to be October 1. but we are tardy in that. Now. mind you. tomorrow night you will probably have your football game. family dinner or general quiet evening interrupted by the Senate working through the weekend. That is where we are now. A vote of monumental importance during prime time television. but not on the job that they should have been doing. no. no. this is a vote on what they want to do. For simple reference sake this is the equivalent of taking out a trillion plus dollar loan. making commitments associated to the loan. and never spending a second asking yourself the following questions: Is this in the budget? Can we afford it? Hell have we even thought about what we are willing to spend on it? Have we decided yet what we are spending on healthcare this year? Healthcare was not a big enough problem this year for the United States Senate to complete the normal course of business by appropriating the spending for Fiscal Year 2010. However. it apparently is a big enough to deal to forward spend a conservative average of over $85 billion a year. It is not a big enough deal to spend the $160 Plus Billion this year that includes Labor and Education as well. The House of Representatives despite passing their appropriation in July has not accounted for the spending in their passage of a conservatively estimated $1.2 trillion Healthcare Plan. I am sure they would argue that they have. their actual spending doesnt start for a few years. I would argue that you had better start thinking about doubling spending in 5 years now. That is a slap in the face to hard working Americans. In my book we all have roles to play. If you got elected to Congress or in this specific case. the Senate. you were placed in a position of public trusteeship. You were elected to spend the peoples money and make sure we are a solvent nation. I bet that they just got so caught up in solving the problem that they forgot to handle the process of budgeting and spending. But wait. they continue to spend. and they make forward commitments with our money that never come in on budget. You will find that I am not a big call to action guy. I am actually kicking myself for not stopping my normal job and getting started railing on this problem before now. I have watched in great horror over the last 10 years as both parties have ignored the process of spending. and funded our government with our tax dollars through one size fits all process. A one size fits all process that generally is traded on our hard earned tax dollars. votes exchanged for passage. It is time for the nonsense to stop. Keep watching them. I have heard and firmly believe that you can track someones intentions by how they plan and spend their money. No matter what the claimed intentions may be. people normally put their money where their mouth is. Congress is putting our money where their mouth is. If Healthcare isnt important enough to finish the appropriations process on. then dont take the time to spend more money on it. RememberIts all about the money stupid. Mr. President. we are finally getting to the spending. We have been spending all year. but we are finally getting to some of these pieces. It still leaves the defense piece undone. We are continuing last years appropriations up to the current time. I have some things I have gleaned from different places. I particularly thank the Wall Street Journal for their articles and editorials that inform America. I think if I were picking one source of information. that is the one I would pick. I read the Washington Post. the Washington Times. the Wall Street Journal. and I get clips from every newspaper in Wyoming. I get a couple of those newspapers complete. I read a lot of news. but from a national perspective and one that is actually paying attention to what we are doing here. my favorite is the Wall Street Journal. Earlier in the week. I quoted from a cost article I had found in the Wall Street Journal. I was chastised for using them as a source and then was countered by a Senator using Wikipedia. You can go into Wikipedia and do your own editing. I am not sure if that is a good source. I would prefer to rely on the Wall Street Journal. There is not any article or opinion that cannot be quibbled with. and that is just like the amendments we have here. What I prefer to think is when an amendment or an article or a speech is given. we ought to be looking for the idea. the grain of truth. the juice of it that should be used. and we are not doing that right now. We are just doing amendments there and amendments here. We are defeating the amendments here. And it kind of bothers me that we have all these amendments from this side because. first of all. our amendments were voted down. all except two. when we went through the Health. Education. Labor. and Pensions Committee process to get the bill out of committee and when we went to the Finance Committee. the same thing happened. I think we had two amendments that were taken as well over a whole week of amendments. The two bills were taken to a closed door back here and were massaged into a new bill. Some pieces of those two bills can be found there. but not all of it and not in the same form. We had no input to that at all. No input at all. Now it is on the Senate floor. and we have the chance to do amendments. I contend the Democrats are filibustering their own bill because every time we put up an amendment. they put up an amendment. If you wrote the bill. that bill ought to be good enough that you do not have to keep countering your own bill. We did not get to write the bill so we ought to be able to make at least some points about what ought to be changed by using our amendments. Last weekone of the most fascinating things around here that I have seenthere was a Democratic amendment and then a Democratic sidebyside to it. Normally we get to present the sidebysides. They are arguing within themselves. It is on a very important issue. Getting back to the spending. I will mention that since taking office. Mr. Obama pushed through a $787 billion stimulus bill. Hardly any of that money has actually gone out. I would guess about 25 percent of it is all because there is health IT in there. It is $47 billion. and that is not going to go out for 4 years. I dont know how you put something in a stimulus bill where you are trying to get something done immediately and not release the money for 4 years. Granted. there is some work that needs to be done in that 4 years in order to make that money worth anything at all. It just fascinates me. We had a $787 billion stimulus bill that was not anticipated to go into effect right away. $33 billion expansion of SCHIP. a $410 billion Omnibus appropriations spending bill. and an $80 billion car company bailout. The President also pushed an $821 billion capandtrade bill through the House and is now urging Congress to pass a nearly $1 trillion health care bill. The administration says it is now instructing agencies to either freeze spending or propose 5percent cuts in their budget for next year. This will not add up to much unless agencies use the budget they had before the stimulus inflated their spending on their baseline in calculating their cuts. That is why we are talking about this bill right now. the minibus or omnibus that is pretty ominous. with all the spending in it. with every one of those bills having a huge increase over a year ago. That will get built into the baseline so next year there can be another huge increase. They compound dramatically. If the Education Department uses its current stimulusinflated budget of $141 billion instead of the $60 billion budget it had before the President moved into the White House. freezing its budget will do nothing to fix the fiscal mess that has been created. As I mentioned. there is this little thing of seconddegreeing their own amendment. The Democrats are having a little problem deciding on their message. On the one hand. the President said just this week that we have to ""spend our way out of this recession. On the other they keep telling us the deficit is too large and isnt sustainable. In this tug of political spin. watch what they spend. not what they say. And that means watching this weekends expected Senate vote."" which we have had. ""on the 1.088page $445 billion""ominous-"" omnibus package of spending bills to fund the government for fiscal 2010. The House passed a similar elephant earlier this week""-I dont know why they are referring to it that way. it is similar to a donkey-""allowing spending federal agency budgets to increase spending by some $48 billion. or about 12 percent from 2009. That increasewhen inflation is negligibleis in addition to the $311 billion in stimulus already authorized or out the door for these programs. Adding this new stash means that federal agencies will have received nearly a 70 percent increase in the last 2 years."" Has anybody gotten that kind of increase? ""Oh. and thats not all. The President and Congress also want to spend as much as $200 billion more from the Troubled Asset Relief Program""-which is another stimulus. but it was done as a series of loans. so we are supposed to get the money back from that. What they are talking about doing is taking the money from that program and using it for some other programs. Anything that comes back is supposed to go to reduce the deficit. Lord knows that is big enough. As I mentioned. there are 5.324 earmarks in this bill. That brings the total for the year to about 10.000 or about 23 for every congressional district. That is after a promise that the President would not sign any bill that had earmarks. but he has already done that once. Hopefully. he will not do it twice. We have been talking about jobs this week. I even got invited to the White House to talk to the President about jobs. Of course. the message the Senator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. and I delivered to the President is. we ought to get the Workforce Investment Act done. That is a job training program that would train 900.000 people a year to higher skill levels to meet some of the skill levels we are missing in this country that we are having to export. What has been the status on this bill? We have been working on this for 4 years4 years. This country did not need jobs before. Now we need jobs. so maybe we are going to get something done on that. She. I. and Senator Kennedy passed this bill through the Senate twice unanimously. but the House has never taken it up. I dont know how we are going to get jobs done if something that is that bipartisanit passed the Senate both times with everybody voting for it. We cannot get more bipartisan than everybody voting for it. We are talking about bipartisan bills. That is really important. Talking about jobs. one of the things I mentioned at the White House was that 2 days before this meeting. the EPA had put out the notice of the new regulation where they are going to take care of greenhouse gas emissions. C02 and seven other chemicals. According to Kimberly A. Strassel: In the high stakes game of chicken the Obama White House has been playing with Congress over who will regulate the Earths climate. Right now the Copenhagen meeting is going onThe presidents team just motored into a ditch. So much for threats. The threat the White House has been leveling at Congress is the Environmental Protection Agencys ""endangerment finding."" which EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson finally issued this week. The finding lays the groundwork for the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions across the entire economy. on the grounds that global warming is hazardous to human health. From the start. the Obama team has wielded the EPA action as a club. warning Congress that if it did not come up with capandtrade legislation the EPA would act on its own and in a far more blunt fashion than Congress preferred. As one anonymous administration official menaced again this week: ""If [Congress doesnt] pass this legislation."" the EPA is going to have to ""regulate in a commandandcontrol way. which will probably generate even more uncertainty."" The thing about threats. though. is that at some point you have to act on them. The EPA has been sitting on its finding for months. much to the agitation of the environmental groups that have been upping the pressure for action. President Obama. having failed to get climate legislation. didnt want to show up to the Copenhagen climate talks with big. fat nothing. So the EPA pulled the pin. In doing so. it exploded its own threat. Far from alarm. the feeling sweeping through many quarters of the Democratic Congress is relief. Voters know capandtrade is Washington code for painful new energy taxes. With a recession on. the subject has become poisonous in congressional districts. Blue Dogs and swingstate senators watched in alarm as local Democrats in the recent Virginia and New Jersey elections were pounded on the issue. and lost their seats. But now? Hurrah! Its the administrations problem! No one can say Washington isnt doing something. the EPA has it under control. The agencys move gives Congress a further excuse not to act. ""The Obama administration now owns this political hot potato."" says one industry source. ""If Im [Nebraska Senator] Ben Nelson or [North Dakota Senator] Kent Conrad. why would I ever want to take it back?"" All the more so. in Congresss view. because the EPA ""command and control"" threat may yet prove hollow. Now that the endangerment finding has become reality. the litigation is also about to become real. Green groups pioneered the art of environmental lawsuits. It turns out the business community took careful notes. Industry groups are gearing up for a legal onslaught. and dont underestimate their prospects. The leaked emails from the Climatic Research Unit in England alone are a gold mine for those who want to challenge the science underlying the theory of manmade global warming. But the EPAs legal vulnerabilities go beyond that. The agency derives its authority to regulate pollutants from the Clean Air Act. To use that law to regulate greenhouse gases. the EPA has to prove those gases are harmful to human health. That is the endangerment finding. One is C02. and I am breathing that out right know. Put another way. it must provide ""science"" showing that a slightly warmer earth will cause Americans injury or death. Given that most climate scientists admit that a warmer earth could provide ""net benefits"" to the West. this is a tall order. Then there are the rules stemming from the finding. Not wanting to take on the political nightmare of regulating every American lawn mower. the EPA has produced a ""tailoring rule"" that it says allows it to focus solely on large greenhouse gas emitters. Yet the Clean Air Actauthored by Congress clearly directs EPA to also regulate small emitters. This is where the green groups come in. The Tailoring rule ""invites suits."" says Sen. John Barrasso Who is the other Senator from Wyomingwho has merged as a top Senate watchdog of EPA actions. Talk of business litigation aside. Mr. Barrasso sees ""most of the lawsuits coming from the environmental groups"" who want to force the EPA to regulate everything. [The President] may emerge from Copenhagen with some sort of ""deal."" But his real problem is getting Congress to act. and his EPA move may have just made that job harder. I thank Kimberly Strassel for those words. Staying on the topic of jobs: House Democrats keep stepping on President Obamas applause lines about innovation and job creation. On Tuesday. Mr. Obama announced that ""were proposing a complete elimination of capital gains taxes on small business investment"" for 1 year. Responding with rare dispatch. the House voted yesterday Actually. that would be the day before yesterday now. Some of these things I wrote and hoped I would give before now. the House voted yesterday to change the capital gains rate for venture capitalists who invest in technology startups. But rather than eliminating the tax. the House more than doubled it. moving the tax rate to 35 percent from 15 percent by reclassifying such gains as ordinary income. Private equity fund managers and managers of realestate and oilandgas partnerships would also get socked with a 133 percent taxrate increase. Now. theres a way to encourage economic growth and new jobs. Knowing how popular tax increases are with unemployment at 10 percent. the House majority rushed the bill to the floor without a hearing or even a committee vote. Then they buried it in a package advertised as an extension of tax cuts for research and development. And that is how it will come over here. And. of course. there are some other problems in the United States with jobs. There are projections that show unemployment in construction will rise by about 1.3 million and that will be outweighed by the continued drop in manufacturing and mining jobs. Goodsproducing employment as a whole is expected to show virtually no growth in total jobs. according to the report. By 2018. that sector will account for 12.9 percent of the jobs. down from 14.2 percent of the jobs. You know. in order to grow the economy. you either have to produce something or you have to sell something. So separately. the number of workers filing new jobless claims rose 17.000 to 474.000 last week. the Labor Department said. which is an unwelcome change after 5 weeks of declines. Of course. accounting is one of my favorite things. I am the accountant in the Senate. and we have been doing some accounting on jobs that are saved. Clear back at the very beginning of the administration. when Secretary Geithner was appearing before the Finance Committee and the President was saying he will create or save 3 million jobs. I asked what is the definition of saving a job? After he explained a little bit on that. I said: Well. I think probably anybody who is employed. still employed would meet that criteria. so why dont you save or create 180 million jobs? But now we have had some measurements done on jobs that were saved. and this one particularly stuck with me. There is a report on the stimulus for a shoe store in Kentucky. and since I used to be in the shoe business as well. that kind of stuck out. This is from the Washington Examinera ticker on stimulus jobs createdand what they said is a shoe store owner claimed to create nine jobs on an $889 contract. when in fact he supplied nine pairs of shoes to the Army Corps of Engineers. A lot of accounting problems around here. and talking about saving jobs without a good definition is only one of them. Lets see. The government has taken over the banking industry. the car industry. trying to take over the health care industry. trying to take over the energy industry. none of which Washington knows much about. but one that hasnt had much said about it yet is student loans. and I am not sure exactly when that is coming to this body. but I did want to mention that the Department of Education right now is pressuring schools to move to a governmentrun student loan program in lieu of utilizing private lenders. who are more efficient and have traditionally offered better customer service. That is why people stay with them. is the better customer service. if the price is the same. However. it is also important to note that the proposed student loan takeover. which is H.R. 3221. would cause private lenders to cut an estimated 35.000 jobs across the country. That is according to a survey by the Federal Family Education Loan Program Industry Groups. With the unemployment rate lingering around 10 percent. it is nothing short of amazing that presumably vulnerable politicians continue to advocate big government programs that will result in privatesector job loss. We will be saying more about that as it comes up. I am not sure when it is going to come up. but I did hear the Secretary of Educationand again. this is good government accountingsaid it would provide another $80 billion for them to work with. Under the best of government accounting. it would be $40 billion. I believe. And even that is only because of the way it is accounted for. Another problem we have now is with taxes. with the estate tax. and that is one that wont die because the Democrats are afraid to let the tax rate hit zero. For years. we have had people saying that the estate tax is not fair. that in this country you get taxed when you earn money. you get taxed when you buy something. you get taxed when you use something. you get taxed when you sell something. but the tax people are upset about is the tax you get after you are dead. We had a bill that already passed. The hated death tax is scheduled to expire. with the rate falling from 45 percent to zero for 2010. Then it will be restructured in 2011 at a rate of 55 percent. This bizarre policy goes back to 2001. when the Democrats wouldnt let President Bush permanently kill the death tax. So the Republicans bet if the tax were eliminated for 1 year. it would never come back. Well. the moment of truth has arrived and the House Democrats recently voted to cancel that repeal and hold the rate permanently at 45 percent with a $312 million exemption. So now the majority leader wants to do the same. and would suspend the health care debate and turn to that estate tax. but he would need 60 votes to do that. and I think that is because all the Republicans and many of the Democrats are saying no to that. BLANCHE LINCOLN and JON KYL. Arkansas and Arizona. have placed some proposals out there. The correct way to tax a gain in the value of assets bequeathed to an heir with capital gains of 15 percent is when the assets are sold. There ought to be some actual action that derives some revenue for it. otherwise. people out our way are having to sell off ranches prematurely in order to have the money to pay off death taxes when the founder of the family passes away. A recent problem we have had with that is that the land values are going up. I suppose they have stagnated at the moment. but it is hard to tell. These ranchers were putting money in. trying to do estate planning so they could pay this with not having to sell off part of the farm. and were doing a pretty good job of that. Of course. they made some adjustments when we made adjustments and started giving them a decline. And there is going to be a lot more said on that yet. We have this massive spending bill. this huge increase in spending. and I want to share with you some of the words of Douglas HoltzEakin. the former Director of the Congressional Budget Office. which we talk about here regularly and point out as being a nonpartisan office. He spoke recently at the Senate Committee on the Budget. or relatively recentlyNovember 10. This is kind of what he said: President Barack Obama took office promising to lead from the center and solve big problems. He has exerted enormous political energy attempting to reform the Nations healthcare system. But the biggest economic problem facing the Nation is not health care. Its the deficit. Recently. the White House signaled that it will get serious about reducing the deficit next yearafter it locks into place the massive new healthcare entitlements. This is a recipe for disaster. as it will create a new appetite for increased spending and yet another powerful interest group to oppose deficitreduction measures. Our fiscal situation has deteriorated rapidly in just the past few years. The Federal Government ran a 2009 deficit of $1.4 trillionthe highest since World War II as spending reached nearly 25 percent of GDP and total revenues fell below 15 percent of GDP. Shortfalls like these have not been seen in more than 50 years. Going forward. there is no relief in sight. as spending far outpaces revenues and the Federal budget is projected to be in enormous deficit every year. Our national debt is projected to stand at $17.1 trillion 10 years from now. or over $50.000 per American. And per American means every man. woman and child. Continuing to quote: By 2019. according to the Congressional Budget Offices analysis of the Presidents budget. the budget deficit will still be roughly $1 trillion. even though the economic situation will have improved and revenues will be above historical norms. The planned deficits will have destructive consequences for both fairness and economic growth. They will force upon our children and grandchildren the bill for our overconsumption. Federal deficits will crowd out domestic investment and physical capital. human capital. and technologies that increase potential GDP and the standard of living. Financing deficits could crowd out exports and harm our international competitiveness. as we can already see happening with the large borrowing we are doing from competitors like China. Yes. the President went to China recently. Secretary Geithner has been to China. They werent over there trying to visit the Great Wall. They were over there trying to explain to China how we would be able to pay off our bonds. And last week. it was said that Standard & Poors and Moodys were taking a look at the United Kingdom and the United States to see if there shouldnt be a downgrade in their rating. And so Mr. HoltzEakin says: At what point. financial analysts ask. do rating agencies downgrade the United States? When do lenders price additional risk to Federal borrowing. leading to a damaging spike in interest rates? How quickly will international investors flee the dollar for a new reserve currency? And how will the resulting higher interest rates. diminished dollar. higher inflation. and economic distress manifest itself? Given the Presidents recent reception in China friendly but fruitlessthese answers may come sooner than any of us would like. Mr. Obama and his advisers say they understand these concerns. but the administrations policy changes are the equivalent of steering the economy toward an iceberg. Perhaps the most vivid example of sending the wrong message to international capital markets are the healthcare reform billsone that passed the House earlier this month and another under consideration in the Senate. Whatever their good intentions. they have too many flaws to be defensible. First and foremost. neither bends the healthcost curve downward. The CBO found the House bill fails to reduce the pace of healthcare spending growth. An audit of the bill by Richard Foster. the chief actuary for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid ServicesAnd that is the CMS. which is a division of Health and Human Services. So this is the chief actuary issuing this report. found that the pace of national healthcare spending will increase by 2.1 percent over 10 years. or by about $750 billion. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reids bill grows just as fast as the House version. Yesterday. or the day before yesterday. we got a new actuarial report that addressed the Reid bill as opposed to the House bill. and we talked about that fairly extensively. I havent seen any articles about it yet. But one summary comment on it is that. according to this Actuary of CMSwhich is a part of the administrationthe cost of health care under the Reid bill will increase by seventenths of 1 percent. That doesnt sound like much. but it is seventenths of 1 percent moremorethan if we did nothing. That is not bending the cost curve down. Mr. HoltzEakin goes on to say: Second. each bill sets up a new entitlement program that grows at 8 percent annually as far the eye can see faster than the economy will grow. faster than tax revenues will grow. and just as fast as the alreadybroken Medicare and Medicaid programs. They also create a second new entitlement program. a federally run. longtermcare insurance plan. Finally. the bills are fiscally dishonest. using every budget gimmick and trick in the book: Leave out inconvenient spending. backload spending to disguise the true scale. frontload tax revenues. let inflation push up tax revenues. promise spending cuts to doctors and hospitals that have no record of materializing. and so on. If there really are savings to be found in Medicare. those savings should be directed toward deficit reduction and preserving Medicare. not to financing huge new entitlement programs. Getting longterm budgets under control is hard enough today. The job will be nearly impossible with a slew of new entitlements in place. In short. any combination of what is moving through Congress is economically dangerous and invites the rapid acceleration of a debt crisis. It is a dramatic statement to finance markets that the federal government does not understand that it must get its fiscal house in order.... The time to worry about the deficit is not next year. but now. There is no time to waste. Again. Mr. HoltzEakin is the former Director of the Congressional Budget Office and a fellow at the Manhattan Institute. This is adapted from testimony he gave to the Senate Committee on the Budget on November 10. Since that time I have been talking about how we have maxed out our credit cards. but this is something known across the Nation. I have to share something. I mentioned I get things from all the papers in Wyoming. This comes from the Lovell Chronicle. That is a place that is probably about 120 miles from Yellowstone Park. That is always how I describe our State. in terms of Yellowstone Park. because a lot of people know where that is. Her name is Diane Badget and she writes a column regularly. My dad used to play this silly game with us. Wed hear ""THUMP. THUMP"" coming from the kitchen. One of us would ask. ""Dad. what are you doing?"" Hed reply. ""Beating my head against the wall."" At that point another of us would dutifully respond. ""Why?"" Then wed wait a second for the expected reply: ""Cause it feels so good when I quit!"" Has the bickering in Washington sickened you to the point where you almost dont care what they do as long as they shut up? Be careful! Thats what some are hoping for. They are disdainful of our feeble attempts to get them to listen to us. They hope that if we beat our heads against the wall long enough well realize how much better wed feel if wed just quit. She goes on to talk a little about Copenhagen. The plans for building safe. clean nuclear power plants to provide electricity evaporated when the promise of a secure place to store spent nuclear fuel suddenly ended. Yet this same administration has decried coal fired plants as ""ecological disasters"" and largescale wind and solar energy as too expensive to build yet. Nothing has been done to utilize the vast reserves of resources in Alaska. Okay. if we cant use coal plants. cant afford wind or sun. Alaska doesnt exist. and nuclear options just got flushed. what should we do? Oh. I know! Lets gather up half of the overzealous geniuses who supported Obamas decision and put them on giant hamster wheels hooked to generators! Then well take the other half and utilize their hot air to turn turbines! It makes as much sense as anything in the Cap and Trade bill. My grandkids cant pray in school. but other kids are provided with prayer mats. No wonder so many terrorists are found right here in the very country they have sworn to destroy. How many more radicals are walking among us. undetected? She talks about: The decision to try the 9/11 conspirators in our court system is a travesty. These murderers have already pleaded guilty in a military tribunal. They are not entitled by our Constitution to a trial. U.S. citizens are entitled to a trial before a jury of their peers. But she does move on to healthcare as well. Are you confused yet? Apparently Congress is. The health care plan that the Senate voted to send to the floor for debate is a perfect example. One side says that it will be deficit neutral. will ensure competition. will not affect Medicare and wont result in more taxes. The other side says it will cost too much. eliminate competition. slash Medicare and tax us out of our underwear. Barbara Boxer (D. Ca) touted Medicare as a great example of how seniors are able to chose a ""public option"". Excuse me? When we turn 65 we are required to sign up for Medicare. How is that optional? I think at this point both sides of the aisle are trying to sell us snake oil. and somewhere in the middle is the truth. Are you worried yet? Are your children and grandchildren going to enjoy the same freedoms and opportunities that we enjoyed? The future of my grandchildren should have been better than the life I had. and my life has been pretty doggone good. Instead. future generations are going to be paying. financially and personally. for the mistakes made right now by a president who presumes too much power and a system of checks and balances that no longer works. We have been talking about having a bipartisan bill here. Maybe that would end the contradiction and furor that we are talking about here. I think a lot of people must have missed the speech OLYMPIA SNOWE made about durable social reform always being bipartisan. I want to share some comments on that. I know her speech wasnt noticed by the press corps. With Majority Leader Harry Reids announcement this week of a doublesecret bargain that Democrats hope will squeeze ObamaCare through the Senate after nine whole days of debate so far in the worlds greatest deliberative body the Maine Republicans words seem more pertinent than ever. Mrs. Snowe began by noting that this years health debate is ""one of the most complex and intricate undertakings the Congress has ever confronted."" and that she. too. has devoted much of her threedecade political career to promoting cheaper. better quality insurance. ""But it must be done in an effective. commonsense and bipartisan way."" she cautioned. Far from ""systematically working through the concerns. the issues and the alternatives."" Mrs. Snowe added. Democrats have instead favored ""artificially generated haste"" and settled on a strategy ""to ram it. to jam it"" through Congress. The Senator detailed her goodfaith participation in the ""group of six"" on the Senate Finance Committee. which met some 31 times over the spring and summer and reflected ""the kind of extensive. meticulous process that an issue of this magnitude requires."" The negotiators tried to build a consensus. blending the best ideas from both parties. Or at least they did before the group of six. and Mrs. Snowe in particular. became a liberal political target for supposed obstructionism. Chairman Max Baucus then pushed their unfinished work to the Senate floor. where Mr. REID is now rushing to pass a bill in a race against its rising unpopularity and President Obamas falling approval

1110029071,Madam Chainan. outlined in the Democrats budget proposal is something called capandtrade. Not many people are familiar with what capandtrade means. But simply. its an energy tax. Its a tax on everyone who drives a car. flips on a light switch. or consumes a manufactured item made in the United States. In fact. its the largest tax increase in American history. amounting to almost $2 trillion. and it will impact everyone. This is why I refer to it as capandtax. Even President Obama admitted to the San Francisco Chronicle that. under this capandtax scheme. energy prices would skyrocket. Total costs of this tax are estimated at nearly $2.000 for each American household. So what does this mean to the American household? What would they have to give up to make up for this $2.000? You could quit eating. Or just dont buy any furniture or appliances for the year. Or maybe dont buy your children any shoes or clothes for the year. Or if youre real concerned about global warming. just stop using electricity and stop heating your home. Or. like some people do today in Washington. just stop paying your property tax. That would make up the $2.000. Under this scheme. the Democrats treat energy as a luxury. When energy becomes a luxury. all else becomes a luxury too because energy makes everything possible. Seldom do the experts agree on much. but on capandtax. theres a clear consensus. It will destroy millions of jobs and devastate our economy. Republicans want to reduce carbon emissions. We believe its a worthy goal. The Republican budget alternative that we will talk about tomorrow expands domestic oil exploration in Alaska. on the Outer Continental Shelf and other untapped natural resources. This will create new American jobs today. highpaying jobs. not phantom green jobs. At the same time. the Republican budget mandates that the revenues from this new oil and gas exploration. literally hundreds of billions of dollars. be directed to things like solar panels and wind farms. No Democrat plan has ever contemplated such a massive investment in solar and wind. And this. all at no cost to the taxpayers. The oil companies pay for it. Our budget also highlights the importance of investments into nuclear energy. Nuclear power produces zero carbon emissions. Let me repeat. zero carbon emissions. It provides us with clean. cheap and abundant electricity. Construction of 200 nuclear reactors would reduce carbon emissions more than any disastrous capandtax scheme. An investment in nuclear power would also help America achieve energy independence. lower consumer prices and. in sharp contrast with the Democrats capandtax scheme. nuclear power investments would actually create jobs. A choice is hereby laid before this body:- A Democrat budget that taxes energy and creates the largest tax increase in American history. while having no impact on carbon emissions. or a Republican alternative that actually invests more in renewable energy than the Democrats. takes more carbon out of the air. and doesnt cost the taxpayers anything. A vote for the Democrat budget would represent much more than a lack of common sense. It would be a clear sign that the priorities of the Democrats rest. not with the American people. but with the special interests of the radical environmentalists. The Republican budget is about common sense. It uses American resources to create American jobs on behalf of the American people. I would urge my colleagues to reject the Democrat budget and. hopefully. we can get enough Blue Dogs to support the Republican alternative that well offer tomorrow.,111120700,NUNES,DEVIN,H,CA,M,R,21,voting,2009-04-01,1406,Mr. NUNES,65163,65278,04012009.txt,3597,589,111,2009,madam outlin democrat budget propos someth call capandtrad mani peopl familiar capandtrad mean simpli energi tax tax everyon drive car flip light switch consum manufactur item made unit state fact largest tax increas american histori amount almost trillion impact everyon refer capandtax even presid obama admit san francisco chronicl capandtax scheme energi price would skyrocket total cost tax estim nearli american household mean american household would give make could quit eat dont buy furnitur applianc year mayb dont buy children shoe cloth year your real concern global warm stop use electr stop heat home like peopl today washington stop pay properti tax would make scheme democrat treat energi luxuri energi becom luxuri els becom luxuri energi make everyth possibl seldom expert agre much capandtax there clear consensu destroy million job devast economi republican want reduc carbon emiss believ worthi goal republican budget altern talk tomorrow expand domest oil explor alaska outer continent shelf untap natur resourc creat new american job today highpay job phantom green job time republican budget mandat revenu new oil ga explor liter hundr billion dollar direct thing like solar panel wind farm democrat plan ever contempl massiv invest solar wind cost taxpay oil compani pay budget also highlight import invest nuclear energi nuclear power produc zero carbon emiss let repeat zero carbon emiss provid us clean cheap abund electr construct nuclear reactor would reduc carbon emiss disastr capandtax scheme invest nuclear power would also help america achiev energi independ lower consum price sharp contrast democrat capandtax scheme nuclear power invest would actual creat job choic herebi laid bodi democrat budget tax energi creat largest tax increas american histori impact carbon emiss republican altern actual invest renew energi democrat take carbon air doesnt cost taxpay anyth vote democrat budget would repres much lack common sens would clear sign prioriti democrat rest american peopl special interest radic environmentalist republican budget common sens use american resourc creat american job behalf american peopl would urg colleagu reject democrat budget hope get enough blue dog support republican altern well offer tomorrow,341,TRUE
1110033327,Mr. President. because ofthe procedure we are following at the moment. I cant make this motion right now. but we will offer the motion at the appropriate time. I rise today to speak about something I am bringing to the Senate. I am on the floor today because I think it is unwise and I also think it is unfair to the American people to use budget reconciliation to pass cap and trade. Just to review the history of this. I joined the senior Senator from West Virginia and circulated a letter asking the leadership of the Budget Committee not to include reconciliation instructions to pass cap and trade. I was very happy that a number of my colleagues agreed with us. Eight Democrats signed the letter. and 25 Republicanseven some who support cap and tradesigned the letter. Notably. the budget resolution which we considered on the floor of the Senate did not include reconciliation instructions. I commended members of the Budget Committee during floor debate for not including instructions for cap and trade. I do so again today. At the same time. I expressed concern that the real threat. though. came from the House in terms of what it had done with its resolution. The House budget. I think we all know. included. interestingly enough. reconciliation instructions. We all know why they included the instructions. The House has no use for them. They are not necessary under House rules. Therefore. there is no reason to include them other than to attempt to force capandtrade provisions into the conference report. We are nearing that day when a conference report will come to us. This would restrict input from the American people. or the Senate body. on a policy that would result in massive taxes and fees. I thank Members on the other side of the aisle. I think they should be commended for what they did next. Understanding that the House was trying to slip climate change into law without review. without debate. without amendment. without consideration. 26 of my colleagues from the other side voted with the Republicans in support of my amendment. What was the result? The result was that 67 Senators made it very clear just a few days ago that they would not support using budget reconciliation to pass cap and trade. This vote. I would offer. showed courage and leadership. Probably most importantly. it showed true bipartisan spirit. Today I am again asking for the support and leadership of my colleagues to stand in support of my motion to instruction the budget conferees. My motion just says: Dont just drop our amendment when you walk into the conference committee meeting. It says: Remember. we voted overwhelmingly against shutting off debate and using as little as a single legislative day to pass complex capandtrade legislation. It says: Dont forget that cap and trade. if passed. will radically change the economic landscape of this great Nation. Amendments to such a bill should not be narrowly limited by the rules of the budget process. a process that was really built for deficit reduction. not greenhouse gas reduction. It asks for leadership from our Senate conferees so the American people can witness a full debate on this very important issue. Where does that leave us today? One might ask the question: Why is the motion necessary? With such a strong showing against including instructions for cap and trade. isnt that message already clear? The message is clear. but I think we have to be vigilant for some simple reasons. First. we learned over the past several days that budget discussions are far from over. Reports indicate that negotiations will continue over the next several days. maybe into the next several weeks. Memories fade. If we think that budget reconciliation is off the table as time wears on. we could be very mistaken. Budget Committee leadership from both the House and the Senate has specifically noted that debate on the inclusion of reconciliation instructions continues to be very intense. In other words. the use of budget reconciliation for cap and trade does remain a possibility. Cap and trade could be slipped into law if the House instructions. as currently written. end up in the conference report. For me. todays motion is about being able to say to Nebraskans when I return hometo look them in the eye and say: Yes. I read that bill. and I carefully considered its impact on you. your families. your businesses. and your future. And. yes. I did everything I could to make sure people from Nebraska understood well the significant tax burden likely to result from the legislation. And. yes. after considering all of those things. I stood up and cast a vote. yes or no. We need to stand up to those who want to use reconciliation to stop transparency and limit debate. I believe both the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. whom I respect. and the Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee. whom I respect. are battling mightily to ensure that reconciliation instructions are not included. Today. on the floor of the Senate. I commend them for that bipartisan effort. But they need our help. They need an army of Senators whose primary concern is the interest of the American people. A vote in support of this motion can do just that. We need this vote. We need to pass this motion.

1110022785,I serve on the Energy and Commerce Committee. and we are having hearings every week. We had one today on the proposed new proposals. capandtrade they call it. of the Obama administration. Now in a time of economic uncertainty. families and small businesses have to conserve. They have to be more efficient. They have to save. They have to be a lot more frugal. This is not the time to massively expand the Federal Government. We should be doing what we are supposed to do in a more frugal way. a more efficient way. And yet the new administration is proposing vast new proposals in the area of governmentowned health care. in the area of capandtrade. which is a tax on all energy use in the United States.,111120840,PITTS,JOSEPH,H,PA,M,R,16,voting,2009-03-18,750,Mr. PITTS,41158,41178,03182009.txt,705,128,111,2009,serv energi commerc committe hear everi week one today propos new propos capandtrad call obama administr time econom uncertainti famili small busi conserv effici save lot frugal time massiv expand feder govern suppos frugal way effici way yet new administr propos vast new propos area governmentown health care area capandtrad tax energi use unit state,55,TRUE
1110037263,I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of House Resolution 338. which supports the goals and ideals of National Community College Month. This resolution recognizes community colleges all across the country for their enormous contribution to educational outcomes and to workforce development. Since the first community college. Joliet Junior College in Joliet. Illinois. was founded in 1901. community colleges have educated mdre than 100 million students in the United States. Community colleges provide a variety of roles for students. It is a place to receive an associates degree. to begin a bachelors degree. -or for workplace training. With more than 1.100 community colleges in the United States and over 11 million students currently enrolled in these schools. community colleges provide a highquality education and resources to students coming from widely diverse backgrounds. Community colleges enroll a diverse student body. In 2000. the United States Department of Education reported that 31 percent of community college students were minorities. and 61 percent of community college students received Pell Grants and met the income thresholds to qualify. Community colleges offer a number of advantages for students. The schools maintain affordable tuition at a time of increasing tuition costs. And for a majority of Americana. community colleges are located conveniently close to their homes. The close proximity allows working students to take courses parttime while keeping their employment. One community college in my district. Colorado Mountain College. has five campuses spread across the mountain areas to help ensure that they have presence close to the places of work and where people live. More students are enrolled parttime in community colleges than fulltime. Additionally. community colleges provide excellent job training to millions of Americans who have lost their jobs or who desire more lucrative opportunities. This is particularly critical in these tough economic times. It costs almost $2.500 per year to attend a community college. while it costs over $6.500 a year to attend a 4year instate college. on average. It is vital that community colleges remain affordable to the millions of students who attend every year. Furthermore. community colleges are at the forefront of innovation. With more than $100 billion included in the economic stimulus package for green job opportunities. community colleges are prepared to provide the type of training necessary to implement our new green investment and help make sure that the renewable energy sector is a strong growing sector with a workforce that is ready to take on the positions. This year. community colleges in our country will award more than 500.000 associate degrees and 270 associate certificates. Countless other students in community colleges will continue their education and transfer to 4year colleges and universities. Community colleges help spur the economy and provide a skilled workforce to contribute more than $31 billion to the Nations economy each year. In Colorados Second Congressional District that I have the honor to represent. Front Range Community College and the Colorado Mountain College are effectively addressing the needs of both students and families and employers. and represent an essential component for ongoing economic development as well as our community pride. The American Association of Community Colleges. the American Association of Community College Trustees. and community colleges across the country support this bill and this month. I urge my colleagues to support the bill as well and would like to thank Representative LATHAM for bringing this resolution forward. for community colleges are instrumental to our Nations economy.

1110034602,"I thank the gentleman. Madam Speaker. I rise today in support of the conference report for the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2010. The previous administration left us with a tremendous challenge to overcome the largest budget deficit ever. the highest unemployment rate in 25 years. housing values in freefall. consumer confidence at record lows. This budget encapsulates a bold vision for making crucial investments in righting our economy and helping our working families. I am pleased that. at my request. the budget reflects an investment in our Federal workforce. including parity between civilian and military Federal employees. Pay parity ensures equitable treatment for all Federal employees. I applaud the conference reports increase in the level of funding for international affairs. Madam Speaker. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in July. under the Bush administration. ""It has become clear that Americas civilian institutions of diplomacy and development have been chronically undermanned and underfunded for far too long."" Secretary Gates understands. and understood then. the value of diplomacy as a national security tool and we would be well served to support that critical investment. I am delighted the conference report has added back funds for the 150 Function. This budget is transformative and provides for the critical investments in America that have been neglected for too long. Deficit reduction. middleincome tax relief. health care reform. education and energy independence are the linchpins of this budget. With this budget. we will cut in half the current deficit of more than $1 trillion. most of it inherited from President Bush. It would further reduce that deficit by 2014 by twothirds. This budget reduces nondefense discretionary spending over the next 10 years to its lowest level as a percentage of the gross domestic product in almost a half a century. This budget supports the middle class by expanding the child tax credit. maintaining the elimination of the .marriage tax penalty. carrying forward the Making Work Pay tax credit. maintaining the estate tax and capital gains tax reductions and ensuring that the alternative minimum tax does not hit the millions of working Americans in danger otherwise of being affected. This budget supports meaningful health care reform. During the last 8 years. the number of Americans without health insurance increased from 13.7 percent to 15.3 percent of the population at the same time health care costs were skyrocketing. Under this budget. Madam Speaker. we will be able to offer health care to the 46 million Americans currently without insurance. This budget invests in energy independence and promotes a clean energy economy creating jobs. Increasing our investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies will promote Americas energy independence and safeguard our environment. In recognition of the critical role that education plays in our economic productivity. this budget also buildg upon the classroom support provided in the Recovery Act. From enhancing Head Start and other early childhood learning opportunities to making college more affordable through Pell Grants. this budget will prepare our children to become productive. contributing members of the global economy. This budget is the product of the hard work of Chairman SPRATT. Chairman CONRAD in the other body. and the budget conferees. and it carries forward the bold investments in America that President Obama has promised this country.

1110007049,Well. you know. today was a great day. When I think about what we have done on education. we provided $300 million for Job Corps centers. These are training. you know. young people who may have fallen through the cracks. but they need the skills to participate in this economy and in the 21st century economy. We have provided the resources for our Job Corps centers to train up those people. not just in my home State of Maryland. but in every single State. I think that there are something like 125 Job Corps centers around the country. $300 million. train them for a green economy. Get those workers out into the workforce. They are weatherizing our homes. they are maintaining and building solar panels and wind turbines and learning how to lay broadband and do the construction jobs that we need throughout the economy. So I think its a really great day for young people who want to go to college and whose parents may have lost a job. or not quite had the job that they had before this economy went into the tank. Those young people will be able to qualify for Pell Grants because we increased the opportunity for that. And so we will have our young people going into college. getting those 2- and 4year degrees so that they can come out to be really full participants in our economy. So I am excited about what we have done. and I agree with my colleague from New York.. YvETTE CLARKE. because we couldnt do everything in this bill. but we sure got a good start for January. 2009. for this new President and this new Congress.

1110068829,I thank my good friend from Michigan. Mr. Speaker. there is a long tradition of bipartisan support for extending these expiring tax relief provisions. I have personally been a strong supporter of the research and development tax credit. the 5year depreciation schedule for farm equipment. and taxfree charitable contributions from individual retirement accounts. That is why Im very disappointed that the majority party has chosen to bypass the Ways and Means Committee and bring a partisan extenders bill to the floor. The bill before us raises taxes by nearly $25 billion at a time of 10 percent unemployment. As our economy is struggling to recover. this tax increase directly targets hardhit sectors like real estate. It simply does not make sense that at the same time we are talking about the need to create jobs. this House is voting for the second time in as many weeks to raise taxes for next year. H.R. 4213 also fails to extend the renewable energy credit for openloop biomass plants. Thats very important to my northern California district. But the President and the Speaker heading overseas to talk about how we need more renewable energy. I cant imagine why we would pull the plug on successful biomass producers.

1110003938,Mr. President. yesterdaya historic daywe swore in a new President who has the vigor and the vision to restore Americas place in the world. I think we would all agree that yesterday he made very inspiring and bold statements about America and how we will invite the world to join us in the efforts to restore our values. in a sense. to the center stage of that debate. but also to join in a renewed effort to find peace and end conflict. I thought his words. particularly to the Muslim world. were very important. We hope. obviously. to be able to move on those initiatives as rapidly as pQssible. Already. the new administration is taking crucial. longawaited steps to embark on a new era of moral leadership and global outreach. It is an understatement to say these are challenging times. We are fighting two wars and the threat of terrorism. as we all know. is as strong as ever. As the President said. we labor under gathering clouds and raging storms of the severest economic crisis of our lifetime. At such a moment. it is essential that we provide the President with the tools and the resources he needs to effect change. That starts by making sure he has the national security team he has chosen inplace as soon as possible. Even this afternoon. the President will follow through on promises he has made to sit down on day one with his national security team. particularly with the military leadership. in order to talk about Iraq. Afghanistan. Pakistan. and the wars we are involved in. That team includes HILLARY CLINTON as Secretary of State. I think everyone can agree that at her confirmation hearing. Secretarydesignate HILLARY CLINTON demonstrated an impressive grasp of the numerous complex foreign policy issues we face and she demonstrated why she is going to make such an effective Secretary of State. She has the stature to project Americas leadership globally and to help build alliances at home and abroad. That is going to be vital to our success in the years ahead. Now. I understand the concerns that were raised about fundraising activities of the Clinton Foundation. Let me start by saying that Secretarydesignate CLINTON and former President Clinton have voluntarily entered into an ethics review and disclosure process with respect to donations to former President Clintons foundation that goes well beyond any requirements under the law or any applicable ethics regulations. This is an unprecedented situation none of us can contest. nor would we. There is no existing blueprint on which to draw here. Secretarydesignate CLINTON and former President Clinton have gone to considerable lengths to create a new review process tailored to these particular circumstances. Senator LUGAR. myself. and others on the Foreign Relations Committee expressed our own concerns about aspects of this new arrangement. We went through a thorough review of the relevant agreements that Senator CLINTON and former President Clinton have entered into. We submitted numerous questions for the record. and they were very direct and blunt questions. We examined this issue extensively in the leadup to Senator CLINTONs nomination hearing. and then again at the hearing itself. Senator LUGAR at quite some length expressed why he saw some issues here and expressed some concerns. but at the same time could not have been more clear about his supportenthusiastic supportfor Senator CLINTON assuming these responsibilities. The conclusion we reached was whatever the concerns some in this body may haveand we dont contest the legitimacy of believing that. as Senator LUGAR said. perhaps going further would have cleared some of the questions that still existbut that doesnt mean that on the other side there is an automaticthat there is a problem. So in essence. none of these questions call into question at all Senator CLINTONs fitness. readiness. and appropriateness in serving as Secretary of State. Senator LUGAR. in his very clearly stated view with respect to this issue. offered a series of wellthoughtout additional proposals. and he made clear that notwithstanding those proposalswhich iu his heart and in his mind he felt would have simply made this much clearerhe nevertheless was clear about his intention. without those being put in place. that he felt it was important that Senator CLINTON be confirmed. It is noteworthy that after a very lengthy discussion about review and disclosure and after the full consideration by the committee itself. the Foreign Relations Committee passed her nomination out and brought it here to the floor by a. vote of 16 to 1. Now. as we think about this issue. for anybody who is not yet decided about what they may or may not do. context is very important. The Clinton Foundation does extraordinary. worthwhile. lifesaving work in areas such as HIV/ AIDS. global climate change. and economic development in sohe of the most impoverished corners of this planet. It is important to remember that the Clintons do not in any way personally benefit financially from the actions of the foundation. So there is none of the sort of traditional notion of financial conflict of interest. It doesnt exist because there is no personal financial interest by either of them. Moreover. according to Secretarydesignate CLINTON. all donations to the Clinton Foundation. including donations to the Clinton Global Initiative. will be disclosed publicly. So nothing relevant to the measurement of a potential conflict is being withheld from the public. Transparency is critically important here. obviously. because it allows the American people. the media. and those of us here in Congress- with an oversight responsibility to be able to judge for ourselves that no conflicts. real or apparent. exist. Senator CLINTON was also very clear personally at the hearing. and in her answers to the questions for the record in saying that she fully understands her obligation and her interest in avoiding any kind of unwelcome distraction. I take her at her word. I hope the rest of our colleagues will do so also. I understand that Senator LUGAR and some others have requested that large donations from foreign entities ought to be disclosed more frequently than the onceayear requirement outlined in the agreement. I happen to agree that that would have been preferable. but the bottom line is that the desired deterrent effect still exists. and the bottom line is the public will still know. albeit in a different time frame. but it will know what the situation is.. Furthermore. all contributions by foreign governments will be subject to a review process by -the State Departments ethics officials. This review will occur prior to the receipt of any such contribution. and Senator CLINTON has made it clear that the process has been designed to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. As all of us know. the appearance of a conflict under the law is always as critical as the reality of a conflict. It stands at the same level of scrutiny and. therefore. I think her statement is a very important one. It is important to note that the pledges for future contributions by foreign governments will also be subject to this same review process. That was an issue of particular interest to me and some other members of the committee. and I appreciate the Willingness of Secretarydesignate CLINTON and the foundation to address the issues during the discussions we had over the memorandum of understanding leading up to the hearing. Again. I and others preferred that those pledges might have also been subject to disclosure requirements. Still. we take comfort in the fact that they are going to be subject to the ethics review process and subject also. frankly. to the stated interest Senator CLINTON expressed before the committee of avoiding any kind of conflict or perception issue. and I am confident she is going to bend over backward to try to make sure that happens. So. in the end. I fully respect the questions that have been raised. I acknowledge that some members of the committee felt that perhaps the final product could have expressed more. but the final product is not contained entirely within the framework of the four corners of the agreement. It is contained in the framework of the hearings and it is contained also in the expressions made publicly by Senator CLINTON about what she intends to do as a matter of personal oversight in this effort to live up to the standards that have been expressed. So I am confident that significant and sufficient checks and balances exist and that we should proceed forward and overwhelminglyI hope unanimously but certainly overwhelminglyconfirm Senator CLINTON. She needs to assume these responsibilities and begin serving the country as our Secretary of State. And while the Senate ponders the ethical implications of Senator CLINTONs charitable work and President Clintons charitable work. we need to remember that the world is moving at a fast pace. There isnt time to delay American engagement in ongoing crises. Gaza is waiting. the Middle East is waiting. Pakistan. Afghanistan. and a host of other issues. and our Secretary of State needs to be in place and empowered to engage in discussions that have been waiting all these months and weeks now. where President Obama has made so clear that we only have one President at a time. Well. now we have that President and that President needs and deserves his security team. So I hope my colleagues will join me in appreciating the larger importance of this moment. put aside those concerns with an appropriate. obvious sort of further expression of them but move forward to allow President Obama and his Secretary of State to confront the multiple crises and challenges that are going to be the measure of our achievement as a country and as a Senate and Congress over the course of the next few years.,111117261,KERRY,JOHN,S,MA,M,D,,voting,2009-01-21,324,Mt.

1110056961,Mr. Chairman. I rise today on behalf of the American taxpayer to continue my push to rein in Federal spending by just 5 percent. As with the other appropriations bills that my colleagues and I have attempted to amend this year. this proposal would enforce a 5 percent acrosstheboard cut to the Energy and Water appropriations bill. My amendment would save the taxpayer $1.7 billion and reset Energy and Water spending levels for the next budget. Spending on Energy and Water programs has increased by. get this. 183 percent over the past 3 years. Under the majoritys control. spending has increased 183 percent. The very programs being funded on the House floor this afternoon have already received $51 billion in stimulus funding and $7 billion in supplemental funding this year. this one year. This Congress has already spent more than $1 trillion than we have taken in. This trilliondollar deficit is the largest in American history. In my opinion. this deficit represents the height of fiscal irresponsibility and is absolutely unconscionable.

But a couple of recent occurrences highlight the fact that this bill really is an assault on coal. And however they try to clean it up. it is not working.

At a news conference briefing held last week at the United States Enetgy Association. FERC Chairman Wellinghoff told reporters that nuclear and coal power was too expensive.

We are just going to borrow from our children and grandchildren and continue to print money and print money and push it off onto the next generation.

1110026963,"Theres no words that can express how disappointed I was to see that the notable bottom of the funding once again went to Government Oversight and Reform. When Republicans took over the Congress in 1994. they dramatically reduced the size of Government Oversight. The following Congress. they did a 48 percent increase. which essentially put it back close to where it was. But not quite. After that time. increases under Republicans have been paltryin some cases. negative. President Obama told us it wasgoing to be different. Speaker PELOSI told us it was going to be different. They both said oversight was important. Now I come from a manufacturing background. and I understand what quality control is. Quality control is not in fact asking the worker if they did a good job. Its somebody indjependently checking. and when they find mistakes. failures. imperfections. design flaws. pointing them out and giving those on the line the opportunity to repair or to change in a way that gives real quality. Theres only one committee in the Congress that has that task. Its not Energy and Commercethe mdstfunded committee. its not Financial Serviceg--one of the other mostfunded committees. Its not even the Rules Committee. It is in fact Government Oversight and Reform. With over 3.200 GAO individuals and hundreds of millions of dollars being spent there. with $800 billion in the stimulus package and one IG with a $450 million budget. with a.$7 billion. and soon to be more. TARP. with virtually no rules and real questions about how much has already been lost. the very idea that. after President Obama includes in his inaugural address oversight. accountability. to defund that committee effectively by flatlining once againsomething that. I mustadmit. I can see the record. and its been done under both types of administrations. under both Congressesclearly makes the statement that is the antithesis of what was claimed. There will be not be -transparency in the Obama administration if in fact Government Oversight isnt properly funded to do its job. Now when I came with Chairman TOWNS before the committee. Chairman TOWNS made the request for the dollars. I didnt. Although I felt his request was modest and reasonable. I added while I was there the request for 30 more slots. Not more money. but more personnel. Because I was confident that Americas volunteerism would include people wanting to come to our committees for just a stipend if we could give them a slotan authorizedtoworkhere positionand that we would find people within a limited budget. Wed be able to work within the small increase that Chairman To s asked for. We didnt get those additional slots. And. notably. we are the only committee I can find that effectively asked for more and didnt get it. Im sad to see that. because I think it is in fact an accountability of Speaker PELOSI "" for not keeping President Obamas promise and commitment to the American people. T apureciate the chairman of this committee doing what he can within the funds. but I realize he does not make the actual decision. He clearly couldnt be making this decision unless he made a decision that oversight was not important. And I dont believe he did. So someone. somewhere in this Congress has decided that oversight is in fact not important. That accountability of this bureaucracynot of this President. as some would have you believebut of the bureaucracy that we. the Congress. have created and maintained and fund at $3.8 trillion. and growing. is in fact what were charged to do. The very idea that chairmen of other committees will in fact do their legislation and then check their legislation flies in the face of experience. It takes a second set of eyes and a second set of hands that have no prejudice toward the original creation of the law. Mr. Speaker. in closing. I would remind people that Oversight has no fundamental jurisdiction that is by any means broad. We dont. We take care of the post offices and we oversee Federal workers. What we do is research into waste. fraud. and abuse in the Federal Government. We are highly limited b& the lack of personnel and the lack of dollars to do it over a $3plus trillion market and countless billions of dollars that have already been wasted under the last administration and continue to be wasted under this administratiQn.

1110013988,"Of course. we know about DavisBacon that will inflate the construction costs of the bill by $17 billion. Section 604 requires that only domestic apparel and textile products may be procured by the Department of Homeland Security. unless the Secretary of DHS determines the quality and quantity cannot be procured in the United States at market prices. whatever ""market prices"" means. There is a provision which states that within 45 days of enactment. the Governor of each State shall certify that they will request and use taxpayer funds provided in the bill. It goes on to say that if any of the money provided by this bill is not accepted by the Governor. then that States legislature can simply pass a resolution to bypass the Governor and receive those funds. I have never seen a provision such as that in the Congress. I repeat. if the Governor of a State says his State doesnt need the money. then the States legislature can simply pass a resolution to bypass the elected Governor of the State and receive the funds. What does that say about States rights and States electing their Governors to lead. It is remarkable. Every Governor in America should be on notice that we may have established a precedent that if you dont want to take taxpayer money. then you can be bypassed by your legislature. It is unconstitutional and should be challenged in court. It adds a new farreaching policy with respect to unemployment compensation entitled ""Unemployment Compensation Modernization""-an interesting description. The new policy would allow a person to collect unemployment insurance for leaving his job to care for an immediate family members illness. any illness or disability as defined by the Secretary of Labor. This provision stems from legislation introduced in the Senate during the 110th Congress that was not approved. Each State would need to amend their unemployment insurance in order to receive a portion of the $7 billion added to the bill for this additional unemployment compensation program. It provides a total waiver of cost savings related to inland waterways projects. 50 percent of the cost is supposed to be carried by private companies that utilize the waterways. The report establishes the Federal Coordinating Council for comparative effectiveness research. The bill text does not use the term ""clinical"" when referring to comparative effectiveness research. leading to the possibility that the bill does not protect against the research being used to. make coverage decisions based on costeffectiveness rather than clinical effectiveness. It includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act. a massive overhaul of our health IT infrastructure that deserves more consideration. It is 1.071 pages and a 41page statement of the managers. a total of 1.492 pages. It was negotiated in a partisan fashion. behind closed doors. in direct contradiction to President Obamas commitments during the campaign. I understand his spokesman yesterday said it was ""an emergency."" It may have been an emergency. but that was not mentioned during the commitments made by thencandidate Obama. Among other things. the conference report contains $450 million for Amtrak security grants through the Department of Transportation. It wasnt in the House bill. wasnt in the Senate bill. It duplicates a program that already exists. I urge my colleagues. when they have a few spare moments. to look at the history of Amtrak. a railroad that was taken over by the Federal Government with the intent to turn it over to the private sector in a short period. We have propped it up with billions and billions of taxpayer dollars. funding that will never become profitable. A provision recreates the slush fund that was unanimously rejected by both the House and Senate. The slush fund allows agency heads to move money around between programs as they see fit without any real oversight by Congress. I mentioned highspeed rail. That is $8 billion. The Senate included $2 billion for these programs. and the House didnt include anything. The conference now has added $6 billion. I mentioned earlier the veterans and military construction spending has been cut by over $3 billion below both the House and Senate bills. Of course. the conference report. among many other items. contains $50 million for NEA. a worthwhile endeavor. but I dont see how you can make the argument it creates jobs. A commitment was made that the spending would be done quickly. The conference agreement drops provisions that require all funds in the bill to be awarded within 30 to 120 days of enactment. Instead. the report allows numerous programs to have 3 years or more to actually begin spending the funding. I know many of my colleagues. including my friend from Illinois. are here. I dont want to take too much time. as many of my colleagues wish to discuss the legislation. I wish to mention there is $2 billion for a neighborhood stabilization program which could go for money for groups such as ACORN. You could make arguments about whether ACORN should be funded. I do not see how that possibly creates jobs. I understand this bill will be passed this evenifig. I hope the next timemaybe with TARPbecause there are going to be other issues of enormous consequence that the Congress and the President of the United States will face in the coming weeks and months. I do not believe things are going to get better in the world real soon. We see activities around the world. from the behavior of the Russians to the Iranian testing of a missile. to renewed aggressive rhetoric by North Korea. to others. including developing a strategy for Afghanistan. But there are also enormous economic challenges here at home. The American people would like us to. and the message they have sent us is. that they want us to sit down and work together. As I said. this bill began with a statement by the Speaker of the House: We won. We write the bill. We need to sit down together before the bill is written. outline the principles. turn those principles we share into concrete legislation. and work together. I hope we never again have a repetition of a bill that has such enormous consequence that would pass through both bodies with literally no Republican supportthree Senators out of 178 Members in the House and 40 in the Senate. That is not bipartisanship. I think we passed up an opportunity this time. I hope the American people will respond again by sending us the message. They want us to address the economic woes we face. but they want us to address them together. This legislation. in my view. is very bad for the economic future of America. Mr. President.

1110019466,Mr. President. I rise today to speak in opposition to the Omnibus appropriations bill that is before us. I think this debate has been good. We have had amendments. I thank the majority leader for allowing amendments to be offered. I note that not one amendment has been agreed to. but nevertheless we have had the debate and I think the American people do deserve to know more about this bill and why there are so many objections to it. I am speaking against it today because of its sheer size. It is a $408 billion bill. But when you account for the previous bills that have already passed appropriations this fiscal year for defense. military construction. veterans affairs. and homeland security. the bottom line is for fiscal year 2009 we are going to spend $1 trillion. Passage of this bill will mark the first time in U.S. history that our regular appropriations process. funding Government in the routine and regular order. will surpass $1 trillion. Last week I offered an amendment. Senator MCCAIN offered an amendment. Senator COBURN offered several amendments. Senator DEMINT. Senator VITTER. Senator KYLso many amendments have been offered but they were basically different ways to bring down the cost of this bill to some kind of responsible. agreedupon area so we can say we are doing the peoples bidding by taking care of taxpayer dollars. That is what we tried to do. First. Senator MCCAIN offered an amendment to say lets do a continuing resolution that funds Government at 2008 levels until October 1. the end of the fiscal year. Next. an amendment was offered by Senator ENSIGN that basically said 2008 spending levels. but with the new bill. with the new authorizations. It will have all of the congressional imprint but it will be 2008 levels. That failed. My amendment was 2008 levels with the rate of inflation. so instead of an 8percent increase in spending in a 1year period. double the rate of inflation. it would have been a 3.8 percent increase from 2008. which I thought was quite reasonable. Furthermore. I said lets decide that we will only take it from the accounts in the bill before us that duplicate what we passed in the stimulus bill weeks ago. In that way. we would say to the American people we are going to fund the Government at 2008 levels plus the rate of inflation. and the way we are going to cut it back is to let the Appropriations Committee decide which of the duplicated accounts that were passed in the stimulus bill 2 weeks ago would be taken outeither the stimulus bill or the bill before us. That was iny amendment and it too failed. We have tried everything we know how to do in a reasonable and responsible way to say to the American people: Everyone is hurting right now and we should not be spending in the regular order on regular Government business. 8 percent above last years rate. My amendment would have been a 1percent cut from this bill and the Appropriations Committee could have chosen where that went. I also suggested that we take it out of the duplicate measures that we passed within 1 month of each other. The American people expect more responsible actions from Congress than spending without restraint. I hear from my constituents all the time. A lot of common sense is coming out of my constituents. I wish we could export the good old Texas common sense to the Congress because what we are saying is why dont we look at the big picture here? Instead of a $1 trillion stimulus spending package on top of $1 trillion to fund Government for the next 9 months. and furthermore we have not even dealt with the financial institutions yet. why dont we step back and look at the problem we have. which is that our financial institutions are not working. our small businesses are not getting credit so they are not able to borrow to stay in business. and the housing market is in the tank? We have not addressed those issues yet and here we are. spending as if there is no restraint. adding to the debt because we do not have the money in the bank. I cannot think of anything more irresponsible than what we are doing in these last couple of months in the Congress. Actually. the stimulus packages from last year were also erroneous. But couldnt we have learned from the mistakes? Couldnt we have learned from what did not worl in the first stimulus package? But. no. we do not seem to have learned. even though it was less than a year ago. I think the American people are showing the concern they have because the stock market is low. and is not getting stabilized. Now we have coming on the heels of this omnibus bill. which we are not accounting for. a $3.6 trillion budget proposed by the President with a deficit for 2010 projected at $1.75 trillion. The cumulative debt of America today is $11 trillion. The proposed budget plan recently suggested a doubling of this debt over the long term. Mr. President. 25 percent of the national debt that we are accumulating is owned by foreigners. The Chinese Government owns almost $700 billion of our debt. This is the same Chinese Government that last weekend took a rather hostile action toward one of our naval vessels in the South China Sea. I think we should be looking at the national security implications of having so much of our countrys debt in the hands of any foreign country or any foreign national. In addition to the concerns about whether the borrowers are going to buy our debt--what if they say: $10 trillion. $11 trillion. youknow. maybe we will buy your debt. but the risk is too great and we will have to jack up the interest rate? What is that going to do to an economy that is teetering so badly? I do not think we can turn a blind eye to the longterm consequences of this debt burden. It is not only irresponsible but it borders on being reckless. When are we going to stop it? If not today. then when? We have a chance today to say to the American people we will go back to the drawing boards and we will put reasonable limits on the amount of debt we are accumulating. We will put limits on the deficits that are being created. I think we should go. back to 2008 levels because we passed a $1 trillion spending plan. Why not go back to 2008 levels and take out the duplication from the stimulus bill and what is in the bill before us today? That would be a responsible action that might start giving confidence to the American people that the Congress and the President will be able to work together in a bipartisan way to act responsibly. with the big picture in mind. I urge the President of the United States not to go forward with the budget that he has put forward. not to go forward with an energy plan that is going to start increasing taxes on every electric bill that every consumer in this country will have. but instead to step back and say lets fix the financial industries. Lets fix the financial institutions. The idea has been propounded is that the FDIC is going to start putting an assessment on.every bank deposit to pay for these other schemes that have no impact whatsoever. There are a lot of things coming out of here that do not make sense. I think it is time for us to begin to show the American people we are going to step back. We are going to fix the financial markets so people can borrow to make payroll and keep people working. so people can stay in their homes and not get foreclosed. and to shore up the housing industry and help them start building and selling homes again. If we can start there. then we will know what kind of stimulus we need. or what kind of further spending would be in the best interest of this country to get our economy going again.

President Bush requested the funds. He did it after Presidentelect Obama asked him to. but I think it ought to be clear on the record. this is a continuation of the Bush policy and it was President Bush who in fact requested the funds.

1110057183,That is absolutely correct. number one manufacturing Nation in the world. the number one trading Nation in the world. Trade is part of the foundation of a strong economy and high standard of living. [- 1915 Today. for example. more than 57 million American jobs depend on trade. and these jobs pay 13 to 18 percent higher wages. Clearly. it would be in our Nations best interest to build on this record. helping us through this difficult economic time. The premise is simple: reducing tariffs and other barriers would make our goods less expensive and therefore more competitive in foreign markets. The additional sales from exports will help sustain and grow our U.S. businesses during this economic downturn. creating much needed job opportunities in the United States. When you combine the fact that demand is sluggish in the United States due to the high unemployment and general uncertainty about the economic outlook with the fact that 95 percent of the worlds consumers live outside the United States. it seems like the commonsense solution would be to encourage U.S. exports by reducing barriers abroad. The best way to do this is to negotiate marketopening trade agreements with other countries. Mr. Speaker. my district in rural northern California is typical of many districts across the United States that are largely dependent on agriculture. We produce more almonds. walnuts. rice. and prunes than we can possibly consume. and heavily rely on exporting these goods to foreign markets. The bottom line is promoting free and fair trade through these agreements is an essential component of economic recovery. Unfortunately. House Democrat leadership has failed to take this necessary step for our workers. despite the fact that we have three agreementsthree agreements already negotiated and just waiting for congressional approval. Two of these pending agreements are with close U.S. allies in South America: Panama. and Colombia. Both of these countries largely already have dutyfree access to U.S. markets due to trade preference programs. while our goods face high tariffs in theirs. Yet. these nations want to move from a oneway trade relationship to a twoway relationship. Why? This Congress is preventing that from happening when our workers would benefit from new opportunities in these markets. It is mindboggling to me that the U.S. Government continues to ignore the needs of our workers in such a way. We also have a pending agreement with South Korea. which is the most commercially significant agreement for the United States. as Korea is already our seventh largest trading partner. Together. these three trade agreements would increase U.S. exports by at least $10.8 billion. as estimated by the U.S. International Trade Commission. That clearly means more businesses for U.S. companies and more jobs for American workers. And these benefits are spread throughout the entire economy. All sectors benefit: manufacturers. agricultural producers. and services. Yet. instead of providing this true stimulus to our struggling economy. Congress and the administration have chosen to tie our hands behind our back. We must realize the cause of this inaction. If the American people knew that denying a vote on the Panama agreement is causing U.S. workers to miss an opportunity to export heavy machinery to Panama for their $5 billion Panama Canal expansion project. would they think Congress is acting in their best interest by sitting on the agreement? I think not. If the American people knew that if Canada ratifies their agreement with Colombia before the U.S.. Colombians will be buying Canadian wheat instead of U.S. wheat. would they think that loss in market share to our competitor is acceptable? I dont think so. If the American people knew that if the European Union ratifies their agreement with South Korea before the U.S.. Koreans are going to use European services instead of services provided by American workers. would they think their Members of Congress are doing whats best for American workers? Absolutely not. By not finalizing these agreements. we not only miss out on opportunities for our businesses to expand. we will also start to lose our current market share to our competitors. The EU. Canada. China. and other nations arent standing still. They will continue to push for their own marketopening agreements that would put U.S. goods and services at a competitive disadvantage. Mr. Speaker. the reality is that if we are not moving forward. we are moving backwardsand other countries arent going to wait for us to catch up. Trade is an essential part of economic recovery and the American people cannot afford for this Congress to continue to ignore it. Expanding trade opportunities for our businesses will help them grow and expand. creating jobs that American workers need right now. And if that isnt reason enough. we dont have the luxury of time to sit back and wait while our competitors race by. I urge this Congress to act on behalf of American workers and pass the three pending U.S. trade agreements. Our great Nation is at a crossroads. Will the Democrat Leadership of this Congress take our Nation down a protectionist path. isolating our Nation from the rest of the world. or are they going to choose the path traveled by Press John Kennedy and Bill Clinton and embrace the quest for open markets that have helped make this country the greatest Nation in the world? During this time of economic instability. it has never been more important for the leaders of our Nation to actively choose open markets and free & fair trade. The United States already tried protectionism in the 1920sit was called the SmootHawley Act of 1928 that raised tariffs on products in every sector which resulted in a worsening of the Great Depression. Mr. Speaker. the American people cannot afford to go down their protectionist path again. We desperately need the benefits & opportunities that these trade agreements create.,111116840,HERGER,WALTER,H,CA,M,R,2,voting,2009-07-15,584,Mr. HERGER,19363,19526,07152009.txt,5967,973,111,2009,absolut correct number one manufactur nation world number one trade nation world trade part foundat strong economi high standard live today exampl million american job depend trade job pay percent higher wage clearli would nation best interest build record help us difficult econom time premis simpl reduc tariff barrier would make good less expens therefor competit foreign market addit sale export help sustain grow us busi econom downturn creat much need job opportun unit state combin fact demand sluggish unit state due high unemploy gener uncertainti econom outlook fact percent world consum live outsid unit state seem like commonsens solut would encourag us export reduc barrier abroad best way negoti marketopen trade agreement countri mr speaker district rural northern california typic mani district across unit state larg depend agricultur produc almond walnut rice prune possibl consum heavili reli export good foreign market bottom line promot free fair trade agreement essenti compon econom recoveri unfortun hous democrat leadership fail take necessari step worker despit fact three agreement alreadi negoti wait congression approv two pend agreement close us alli south america panama colombia countri larg alreadi dutyfre access us market due trade prefer program good face high tariff yet nation want move oneway trade relationship twoway relationship congress prevent happen worker would benefit new opportun market mindboggl us govern continu ignor need worker way also pend agreement south korea commerci signific agreement unit state korea alreadi seventh largest trade partner togeth three trade agreement would increas us export least billion estim us intern trade commiss clearli mean busi us compani job american worker benefit spread throughout entir economi sector benefit manufactur agricultur produc servic yet instead provid true stimulu struggl economi congress administr chosen tie hand behind back must realiz caus inact american peopl knew deni vote panama agreement caus us worker miss opportun export heavi machineri panama billion panama canal expans project would think congress act best interest sit agreement think american peopl knew canada ratifi agreement colombia us colombian buy canadian wheat instead us wheat would think loss market share competitor accept dont think american peopl knew european union ratifi agreement south korea us korean go use european servic instead servic provid american worker would think member congress what best american worker absolut final agreement miss opportun busi expand also start lose current market share competitor eu canada china nation arent stand still continu push marketopen agreement would put us good servic competit disadvantag mr speaker realiti move forward move countri arent go wait us catch trade essenti part econom recoveri american peopl afford congress continu ignor expand trade opportun busi help grow expand creat job american worker need right isnt reason enough dont luxuri time sit back wait competitor race urg congress act behalf american worker pass three pend us trade agreement great nation crossroad democrat leadership congress take nation protectionist path isol nation rest world go choos path travel press john kennedi bill clinton embrac quest open market help make countri greatest nation world time econom instabl never import leader nation activ choos open market free fair trade unit state alreadi tri protection sit call smoothawley act rais tariff product everi sector result worsen great depress mr speaker american peopl afford go protectionist path desper need benefit opportun trade agreement creat,545,FALSE
1110074213,"Thank you very much. Mr. President. I rise to talk about the 2010 Department of Defense appropriations bill. There are several parts of this legislation I would like to discuss. But first of all. I would like to talk about the process the majority has used for this bill. This past weekend. we passed an omnibus bill that jammed together six different appropriations bills. I had high hopes that this year we would not have to resort to an Omnibus appropriations bill. We have done it in the past. I was hoping this year we would not. I hoped we could go through regular order and give each bill the time and attention it deserves. In fact. I think we could have done that if we were not spending so much time on the floor with this monstrous health care bill. We have had a lot of floor time but not much action on health care. However. earlier this week. we passed a bill containing all the remaining appropriations bills. except the one for funding the Department of Defense. Why was this done? Why was this bill left for last? It was done because this bill was used as a political football. The majority felt that because this bill contains important funding for our troops. they could attach unrelated provisions to it and then insinuate that anyone who has concerns about these provisions and tries to slow down the bill to look at them is jeopardizing our fighting men and women. In fact. some Members of the majority have made those claims this week. My question to them is. why didnt the majority include the appropriations for the Department of Defense in the omnibus we just passed? The funding for our troops could have been signed by the President and made into law by now. However. the majority wanted to use this funding as a political hammer. This is not right. and the American people should know what is really going on here. Our troops deserve better. I wish to talk about some of the provisions contained in this bill. beginning with the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. The bill before us does provide that no detainees from Guantanamo may be released into the United States. It also does not provide funding for the closure of the Guantanamo detainee facility. These are good provisions. but they are not good enough. This bill does not prevent sending these prisoners to the United States for trial and housing them in our own backyards. It would be much improved if it contained a complete ban on moving them to the United States. On January 22. 2009. President Barack Obama signed an Executive order to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay. I am against the shutting down of that facility. It is absolutely irresponsible to order this closure and not have a plan in place to address what the United States will do with all the detainees held there. Under no circumstances should they be brought to the United States. The terrorists housed at Guantanamo Bay are the worst of the worst. I have personally visited these facilities and met with the brave men and women who guard these detainees. As long as the terrorists remain housed at Guantanamo. they cannot harm us or any of our allies. However. the administration has seen fit to push ahead on sending Guantanamo detainees to the United States. In fact. we learned they now plan to send some of the most dangerous terrorists in the world to Illinois. President Obama could not bring the Olympics to Illinois. but it looks as though he will bring terrorists there instead. The plan appears to be to use a currently empty supermax facility in northwestern Illinois to hold Guantanamo detainees. I think bringing these terrorists to the United States is a terrible idea. First of all. there are serious legal problems associated with bringing these terrorists to our soil. The Supreme Court has noted that it is ""well established that certain constitutional protections available to persons inside the United States are unavailable to aliens outside of our geographic borders."" The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said that ""noncitizens held in the United States may be entitled to more protection under the Constitution than those detained abroad."" This means they could be afforded extra rights which are available to American citizens. They could include protection under the fifth amendment due process clause. which would cover how they are confined. or they also may raise claims regarding religious practices. Furthermore. while the Obama administration may not have the intention to release any detainees. their wishes could be overruled by a civilian judge. Guantanamo detainees who are cleared for release have. in fact. petitioned the court to be released into the United States. Last year. a Federal judge even approved such a request before being overruled by an appellate judge. The reason the higher court cited for overturning the ruling was that the government could not be forced to accept someone into the United States from outside the country. If we start bringing detainees to the United States. this legal safeguard will be removed. Throughout the debate on whether closing Guantanamo is good policy. supporters of the idea have consistently maintained that the facilities serve as a lightning rod for antiU.S. sentiment and that it is used as a recruiting tool for terrorists. I dont buy that argument. I would argue that the greatest recruiting tool for these terrorists is the United States itself and our way of life with democracy and freedom of religion. What if it was found that the Statue of Liberty was being used as a symbol to incite attacks on our country? Would we tear it down? Of course not. The United States has suffered many terrorist attacks prior to the opening of the Guantanamo Bay facility. including the horrific events of September 11. 2001. If we close this facility. then those who hate us will simply find another tool of motivation for their followers. The bottom line is that the Guantanamo Bay detention facility works and we are putting ourselves at a disadvantage by not using it. I wish this bill had taken a stronger position on making sure this facility is not abandoned. As everyone here knows. this bill also provides further funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. I was glad to see that the President finally announced a plan for Afghanistan earlier this month. We waited far too long for this decision. I was very concerned that this wait was unnecessary and was putting the lives of our servicemembers at risk. I am glad he finally heeded the call of our commanders on the ground for more troops. In fact. I agree with the bulk of his strategy for waging the war in Afghanistan. However. I strongly disagree with him on one particular issue. I have serious concerns about the administrations decision to set a timetable for troop withdrawal. I could not disagree more with the announcement that U.S. troops will begin leaving Afghanistan in July of 2011. What makes this situation even more confusing is that the announcement also claimed that any withdrawal will take conditions on the ground into account. This is puzzling and it is a contradiction. What will the administration do if conditions on the ground dictate that no troops be removed from Afghanistan? Will it proceed with a withdrawal anyway? I dont want to keep any of our brave men and women in Afghanistan any longer than absolutely necessary. but we have work to do. Leaving before it is done is unacceptable. By announcing an arbitrary deadline for our forces to come home. possibly before the job is done. the President is telling our enemies how long they will have to hold out and wait until we leave. They will bunker down and emerge after we are gone. It is unimaginable what the horrible consequence of this would be. I was glad to see this strategy rejected in Iraq. and it is no less foolish to apply it to the war in Afghanistan. I fear we could be setting our efforts up for defeat and putting our fighting men and women in further danger. and I am deeply troubled by this. While I strongly oppose President Obamas notion for a timeline for withdrawing from Afghanistan. I do support his call for a surge of troops to stabilize the country. We learned a great deal from our counterinsurgency strategy implemented by GEN David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker in Iraq. He knew that if the U.S. forces spent most of their time only in a small protected area such as the Green Zone in Baghdad. then little would be accomplished. The surge in Iraq was successful not only because there were simply more troops in Iraq. it was what they did that mattered. By simply going out into insurgent areas and being more visible. this gave reassurance to the local populations that Americans were still around. but it did not stop there. Previously. coalition forces would clear an area but then retreat. This time. they were there to stay. Our soldiers became involved with the local communities. assisting with infrastructure and even doing things such as helping to set up farm cooperatives. The strategy evolved from only clear. to clear. hold. and build. Soon. our forces had the trust of the locals. The citizens of Iraq began to help with the stabilization and rebuilding of their country. They began to cooperate with our military efforts and help us fight insurgents. Before. they were scared and powerless. Now they were safe and had the ability to make their lives better. These conditions have made it very difficult for our enemies to operate. It is now time to apply these lessons to Afghanistan. It is time to clear. hold. and build there. It is unfortunate but true that the Afghan Government suffers from a deplorable level of corruption. However. it will not do us any good to refuse to help until things get better. This is because they wont get better without our help. The citizens in Afghanistan by and large do not trust their government. and this creates an atmosphere that is very helpful to our enemies. When our forces move into communities. they create stability and undermine insurgent forces and corruption. Use of the proper strategy can help improve the government. as we have seen in Iraq. However. if it is not improved. then the people will never trust it and it will not protect them. They will have no choice but to comply with the wishes of the insurgents. Eventually. the government will slide into chaos and the Taliban and alQaida will return to power. We cannot let this happen. A return to Afghanistans previous status as an unhindered launching pad for global terrorist plots is totally unacceptable. We know all too well what the consequences of this are. However. it could possibly get even worse than that. We have seen the difficulties Pakistan has had in fighting the Taliban on its own soil. Currently. U.S. and NATO forces are fighting and hopefully soon beating the Taliban and alQaida in Afghanistan. If we were to leave before finishing the job. the result could be disastrous for Pakistan. A Talibancontrolled Afghanistan would be a sanctuary and staging point for the radical Islamist terrorists to attack from. Pakistan is a nuclear power. and its fall to these groups would be utterly catastrophic. Victory in Afghanistan is essential. We learned a lot from the Bush administrations revised strategy for Iraq that put that war on a path to success. It would be a shame if we did not apply those hardlearned lessons to the current conflict in Afghanistan. As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks. this is a large billlarger than it had to be. The use of this Defense appropriations measure as a political football is why it is so big. I think it is a shame that the majority chose to legislate in this manner. We did not need to do it this way. It is probably too late in this process for us to fix this mashup of different bills and give all of these issues the individual attention that they deserve. However. hopefully. next year will be different. Hopefully. the majority will not try to once again politicize the bill that is supposed to be about funding our military. Hopefully. they will not hold this bill back and wait until the last minute like they did this year. It is the responsibility of the majority to set the schedule of the Senate. We will see this time next year if they are still devoted to playing politics with the funding of our troops. I sincerely hope they are not.

1110044438,Madam President. I did notice that in the last couple of weeks. a Federal appeals court has even looked at a landmarkruling that found that the Nations top tobacco companies were guilty of racketeering and fraud for deceiving the public about the dangers of smoking. A threejudge panel of U.S. courts of appeals in Washington unanimously upheld requirements that manufacturers change the way they market cigarettes. The requirements. which have been on holdpending appeal. would ban labels such as low tar. light. ultra light. or mild. since such cigarettes have been found to be no safer than the others. That is one of the requirements in this billthat they cannot use that kind of false advertising. I wish to share some facts with you. The Senator from Connecticut shared some with you. These are from the Centers for Disease. Control and Prevention. Among current U.S. adult smokers. 70 percent report they want to quit completely. In 2006. an estimated 19.2 million adult smokers had stopped smoking for at least 1 day during the preceding 12 months because they were trying to quit. That is more than 44 percent of the smokers. Think about it70 percent of smokers want to quit. and 44 percent of them are trying each year. Unfortunately. not enough of them succeed. I know what a terribly addictive thing it is. I watched my parents deal with it. The numbers are even more shocking when we consider youth smokers. Nearly one in five young people smokes. but more than 54 percent of current high school smokers in the United States tried to quit smoking during the preceding year. We need to get people to stop smoking or. better yet. never start. I support incentives to quit smokingfor example. offering incentives to lower health insurance premiums for those TE S5921 who stop smoking or. better- yet. who never start. That becomes a continuing cost to us. The cost of health care is out of control. There seems to be support in the context of health care reform. Full. fair. and open debate is critical to the democratic process. I am pleased to have the opportunity this week to offer amendments to this bill to help lessen the toll tobacco takes on our society. Senator DODD mentioned the committee action. We have a committee that works a little differently from some of the others. We look at that opportunity of the committee process to see what the key concerns are and to see how they can be incorporated into making a better bill. That is what Congress is about. That is why we have 100 people here and 435 on the other end of the building. so that we get a lot of backgrounds. opinions. and ideas. so that can avoid unintended consequences and tighten up precesses so that what we are trying to do can. actually get done. I appreciate the way this bill has been worked on. One of the things we did. of course. was leave about six amendments to be worked on in the interim. before we actually get to amendments on this bill. I am hopeful those can be worked out so they will tighten up the bill a little bit more. This Congress does have a unique opportunity to have an impact on smoking and health consequences. My record is clear when it comes to tobacco. I am no friend of big tobacco. I have never taken a dime of tobacco company money for my campaigns. and I dont intend to start now. I have ideas to make a real impact on the public health and win the war on tobacco. I thank the Senator and all those on the other side of the aisle for the serious consideration they are giving the bill and the opportunity now to have the floor debate. I am hoping we will stick to germane issues so that it will stay a tobacco bill. That is the only way we will actually reach a conclusion on it.

1110000880,"Thank you. Mr. Speaker. What I would like to do today is to talk a little bit about the new stimulus package that Presidentelect Obama and some of the leadership has been talking about. the last stimulus package that we did. the rescue plan. and talk a little bit about the timetable. And exactly. Mr. Speaker. where the people of this country may get an idea of exactly where were going because sometimes things happen so fast in Washington that they dont really have an opportunity to grasp exactly what has happened to them not only now. but in the future. And not only in their future. but in their childrens future and in their grandchildrens future. So what I would like to do today is talk a little bit about how we got into the situation that were in now and what direction the new administration and the new majority or the larger majority is going to take us. And what I would like to do. Mr. Speaker. is start in October of 2007 when the Dow Jones was 14.078. October 10. The Bush administration responded to the unfolding subprime mortgage crisis -with the HOPE program. which was a program designed to help people in foreclosure to go back and to renegotiate their mortgages. At the time. if you will remember. we were told that there were about 80 million mortgages in this country. about 5 percent of them were bad or subprime or delinquent. which is about 4 million loans. January of 2008. the Dow closed at 11.971. and it has gone down continually since then. In September of 2008. we were informedthe White House. the Congress was informed by Secretary Paulson that we were in a financial crisis. that something had to be done to unfreeze the credit market. that the credit market was frozen. that banks couldnt borrow from each other or wouldnt lend to each other. that large corporations were not able to do overnight borrowing. that student loans were not there. that automobile loans were not there. that loans for new homes were not there. and that we need to unfreeze this. And to unfreeze this. it was going to take $700 billion. Now. $700 billion is a lot of money. and its going to affect people for a long time. Its going to create more of a deficit for our country. which a lot of people in this body. especially on the majority side of the aisle. has said was not good policy. not good finances to spend deficits. So we had $700 billion. Now. if you take the 4 million delinquent or toxic assets or mortgages. thats about $175.000 per mortgage And. Mr. Speaker. I dont know of a lot of mortgages that were in trouble that $175.000 would not have cured. But what we did is we didnt do anything with those mortgages. We decided that we would bail out those guys that had taken these mortgages and had leveraged them 45. sometimes 50 percent. And while they were doing this. they were making money handoverfist. While the poor guy in the house was losing his home. he was losing his job. this guy that had come up with all of this creative financial stuff with all of these derivatives that nobody really understood. and the only thing a lot of the guys coming up with these derivatives understood is that they were making a ton of money. So they were selling these things. And not only did it affect our economy and our banks and our financial institutions. but it did worldwide. n 1415 These four million bad loans that could have been solved with $175.000 each. if you took from the $700 billionprobably much. much. much less than thatand all of a sudden we had this great financial crisis. And so the one thing that I heard. Mr. Speaker. over and over again. not only in this body. but in the Senate and all the pundits on some of these talk shows. was. well. this is kind of like a traffic accident on the expressway and its got all of the lanes blocked. Credit is frozen. This is the highway of credit. its frozen. And behind it sitting in line in traffic is the student loans. the car loans. the mortgage loans. the small business loans. the payroll loans. all the credit is sitting in line. Weve got to free up this accident. And so we did. Congress voted to free up this accident. All lanes are clearwell. at least the majority of the lanes are clear. weve only done $350 billion of the $700 billion. but theyre going to be back wanting the other $350 billion. But the. credit market- is not unfrozen. We still have people today that are getting foreclosed on every day. I dont care if youve got credit thats 850 on your credit score. you probably couldnt go borrow a dime today. These banks and these financial institutions. AIG is oneyou know. AIG used to write bonds for construction and development. They wrote bonds. They wont even write you a bond now. and the government has given them about $125 billion. What are we doing? So if you look at all of these things that were intended in this one bailout that was intended to unfreeze the credit market. we can see that it hasnt worked. And not only has it not worked. we have not even tried to make any of these lending institutions. these banks. holding companies. insurance companies accountable for the money that weve given them. Mr. Speaker. Im sure that youve got the same thing Ive got. community banks. small banks calling me every day saying weve applied for the TARP. weve applied for the Capital program. we cant get any money. We cant get any money. And so whats happening? If you think that the big nine banks are going to come into these communities and loan somebody money to start a beauty salon or a car wash or an automotive repair. or whatever. youre badly mistaken. The community bankers. those small banks in our communities that know Fred and they know Jane. they know their families. they know what kind of reputation theyve got. they know their ability to pay back this money. these are the people that are being squeezed out. And the American people are depending on us to do something about it. I was happy to talk to Chairman FRANK. and he said within the next 2 weeks hes going to have legislation come out of Financial Services thats going to do that. We need to make these people accountable because the very taxpayers that are paying the $700 billion that weve given to the fat cats to balance their books and to hold the money to buy out the small and the community bank. weve given them the money and we still cant get credit. Mr. Speaker. I had a Chrysler dealer that came into my office and he sat down and told me over a period of time. a small period of time. he had sent 155 contracts or sales to Chrysler. they had approved seven of them. If we were supposed to have cleared the wreck and we were have supposed to freed up this credit market. it has not worked. and the American people and myself and many others in this body want to know why it has not worked. Now. lets look at the deficit for a minute because were borrowing this money that were using to stimulate or to buy.out--or whatever you want to callremember that we passed a $150 billion stimulus package. Mr. Speaker. where we actually sent checks to people to stir up the economy. to give the economy credibility. I dont think it worked. Evidently it didnt work. So whats been the result of that? We borrowed that $150 billion from China. The stimulus thats being discussed todaynow. were beyond the $700 billion stimuluswell. lets start out with the $150 billion stimulus. then the $700 billion stimulus. and then the loan to the automakers. And now were talking about another $700. $800 billion up to 1.3 trillion. Now. keep in mind if you look at the bailout that had already been done after the first stimulus where we gave checks back to people. we had AIG. we had IndyMac. we had Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. we had the housing bill. we had already spent about $700 billion. Youre starting to talk about some real money now. Mr. Speaker. You now. this range of $800 billion to $1.3 trillion. what does that mean? Well. Ill tell you what it means. it means that the deficit for 2009 is going to be $1.3 trillion. triple the current years deficit. In fact. its going to be 9 percent of our gross domestic product. 9 percent of our gross domestic product in this onenot counting all the other thingsthis one deficit in this 1 year. 9 percent. which is a 50 percent increase over World War IIs record deficit of 6 percent of the gross domestic product. So what that means is that some governments. some countries are thinking about charging us a prime or a premium interest rate from foreign investors. such as China is now thinking about charging us a premium for this money that were borrowing from them. Now. what Ive heard is that this majority plan. the Democratic plan. Mr. Speaker. thats coming from the Presidentelect and the Senate and the House leaders is that this infrastructure. part of this will be infrastructure projects thats ready to go. shovel ready so to speak. theyre ready to get out there and theyre ready to get it on. The Conference of Mayors published a list of these projects that were ready to go. they put it on their Web site. So Mr. Speaker. if anybody was listening todayand I have to remember that most of my constituents at 2:30 in the afternoon. those that have jobs are out working. We didnt have. any votes today in this body. so for you that may be taping this or may have an ""opportunity of a loved one to see it. we actually counted votes todayor had some people count them for us and we watched them. So we had a pretty easy day today. had a pretty easy day yesterday. In fact. we were out by about two oclock yesterday. Well probably have a pretty easy day tomorrow. I think weve got two bills. But for those of you that are watchingand that could be. Mr. Speaker. if I was talking to somebody out in the audience. if I was addressing them I would tell them to go to a Conference of Mayors Web site and look at some of these projects that are ready to go. that are infrastructure and vitalI believe it says vital infrastructure projects. The first one is $350.000 for an Albuquerque. New Mexico fitness center. Thats a vital project. Ninetyfour million for a parking garage at the Orange Bowl in Miami. Now. these are the readytogo infrastructure projects that our tax dollars are going to go into. these are those vital projects. $4.5 million for Gretna. Florida to bottle water with recyclable bottles. $35 million. Music Hall of Fame in Missouri. $55 million for a mob museum in Las Vegas thats described in the Mayors report as ""historic post office museum rehabilitation."" You know. we think of so many good ways to name these bills that they just are really warm and fuzzy. and so sometimes you dont pull back the covers. Twenty million for a minor league baseball museum in Durham. North Carolina. and $6 million for snowmaking and maintenance facilities at Spirit Mountain. Minnesota. Now. I apologize to those Members. Mr. Speaker. that these are in their districts and that these may have been put innot necessarily put in the package to get a vote or two. I dont know. But what I do know is that the lady and the gentleman and the family thats sitting around the kitchen table wanting to know how theyre going to pay their house note or their car note or what theyre going to do because mom or dad. or both. dont have a job. they dont think these are such vital projects. They dont think theyre that vital. What they think is vital is us starting to do something rather than just talking. Weve been talking long enough. Its time to take some action and to have some real cure for the taxpayers of this country. and not just the taxpayers today. but the taxpayers of the future. my children and my grandchildren. and maybe even my great grandchildren at the rate that were going. Ill turn now. after weve talked about that for a little bit. Mr. Speaker. and I want to quote Presidentelect Obama. January 8. 2009. ""Only government can break the vicious cycles that are crippling our economy."" You know. I think there is some truth in that. Although I think that we the people. the entrepreneurs. the free market system. do a much better job than government - doing anything. but I think the truth of this statement is that only government can break the vicious cycle. Yeah. governments got to get out of it. If we want to break the vicious cycle that were in of rewarding bad behavior. weve got to get out of this and let the market take care of itself. But no. we havent learned from that because. you know. you would think that with the Dow going down every day. even with all the money that were pumping in it. we would go. you know what? This isnt working. Weve got a problem here. Lets look at it. lets see what it is. And we might find out that were our own worst enemy. Mr. Speaker. But lets talk about the national debt. Lets talk about bhe deficit. The national debt is currently more than 10.6 trillionand Im talking with a ""T."" You know. it took me a while. when I got into government. to learn what a million dollars was. and then it took me a little bit longer to learn what a billion is. Its hard to get your head around a trillion. So Mr. Speaker. if anybody is at home that is going to go to the Mayors Conference vital projects Web site might also want to go to a math Web site and try to figure out how much a trillion is. But our national debt today is $10.6 trillion. continues to grow. The national debt has increased by $2 trillion since the Democrats took over Congress just 2 years ago. $2 trillion increase. The Presidentelect on 60 Minutes. November 16. said we shouldnt worry about the deficit next year or even the year after. Speaker PELOSI. on a floor speech on March 17 of 2005. said. ""Democrats have made a commitment to honor the value of accountability. including eliminating deficit spending."" STENY HOYER. speech at the National Press Club September 28. 2007. Mr. Speaker. he said. ""Today Democrats are fighting to restore the fiscal discipline that has been sorely lacking since 2001. Why? Because we believb deficits and spiraling debt threaten our future prosperity and national security."" .What has changed in a year. a little over a year. whats changed? Rahm Emanuel. the Presidentelects Chief of Staff in the White House. January 26. 2005 floor speech. ""If youre looking for a crisis to solve. look no further than the Presidents budget deficit. The Presidents reckless policies are damaging our Nations future."" This is the same Chief of Staff of the Presidentelect that the Presidentelect said we shouldnt worry about the deficit next year or even the year after. 0l 1430 BART GORDON. in a press release of January 5. 2007. said. ""American families must live within their budgets. and its time for Congress to do the same."" MIKE Ross. in a floor speech December 6. 2005. said. ""Deficits do matter. Deficits reduce economic growth. They burden our children and grandchildren with liabilities. They increase our reliance on foreign lenders who now own 40 percent of our debt."" Thats right. foreign lenders now own 40 percent of our debt. I would venture to say to my good friend from Arkansas I would like to work with him to try to find out what percentage foreign investors and lenders own of our debt right now. where theyre even thinking about charging us premium interest because 9 percent of our gross domestic product is going to be in that debt. TIM RYAN. July 6. 2004: ""We have almost a $600 billion annual deficit for the past year. This is getting rolled into our $7 trillion debt that we have. So almost 20 percent of our annual budget that we pay down here is interest on the debt that we have. So if you keep accruing the big debt. you have to keep taking tax money to pay it off. Whos lending us this money? Japan and China are lending us this money.""",111121730,WESTMORELAND,LYNN,H,GA,M,R,3,voting,2009-01-08,168,Mr. WESTMORELAND,15619,16080,01082009.txt,15754,2870,111,2009,thank mr speaker would like

It is unfortunate that. even in todays world. there are still individuals who choose to deny the tragic events of the Holocaust. In the face of those who adhere to hatred. we must continue to stress the importance of knowledge over ignorance. with the hope that we can prevent future tragedies such as this. And that is just what the Holocaust Museum strives to do. Each year. some 2 million people from around the world visit the museum where they are confronted with a record of the horrors of the Holocaust so that no one can deny its existence. The museum not only reminds us of the atrocities of the Holocaust. but it shows us what happens when hatred. intolerance. and ignorance are allowed to direct the actions of men. The museum calls each one of us to recognize the humanity in all people. regardless of our differences. Its role in educating visitors about the responsibilities each individual has and its efforts to promote tolerance. understanding. and acceptance continue to be needed.

But thats not what its about. It is about creating new law. new crimes that are duplicates of whats in every State in the Union. Now. there are 45 States that already have hate crimes bills. but even there. most are unnecessary. The case that you often hear that is a reason we need hate crimes is the James Byrd case. where this poor gentleman. AfricanAmerican. was dragged to death. Now. I would be in favor of allowing the victims family to pick the terrain and the manner of dragging the defendants once they are convicted. but thats not allowed. The death penalty amendment was even voted down. So theres no enhancements. nothing that would affect the poster cases that are constantly raised .as a reason to have the hate crime laws. And. in fact. when we hear over and over theres these epidemics of hate crimes that we have to stop. actually. there were nearly a million assaults In America in 2007. 242 assaults included some kind of bodily injury in which there was some motive attributed to bias or hatred because of a selected group. 242. Again. there was a killing of a poor young man named Nicholas West. killed because he was a homosexual. His perpetrators were not charged under a hate crimes law. they were charged under a capital murder law for kidnapping. And they have already got the death penalty. just like the worst two perpetrators in James Byrds situation. So what is this about? Well. perhaps its about trying to create a special class of protected people who maybe shouldnt have protection. One of the last amendments we made today was going toat least in this definition the term ""sexual orientation"" is included. We kept trying to confine it to things that were not just an aberration. and even the amendment to at least exclude pedophiles from the protected class was voted down on a strict party line. Every Democrat there voted to protect pedophiles and every Republican voted to exclude them. at least. from the definition of sexual orientation. We were told. well. there is a definition in one of the other laws about sexual orientation. and it confined it to heterosexuality and homosexuality. Its not in this law. Its not there. There is no reference to another law. So as a former appellate judge I would be left in reviewing the law to say well. what is the plain meaning? You can consider other definitions. Well. some judge will do the right thing that a judge is supposed to do and say. hmm. sexual orientation. it means what it says. Its however you are oriented sexually. If thats towards childand the diagnostics statistics manual has about 30 different types of sexual orientation. So that includes voyeurism. it includes the pedophilia. it includes things like exhibitionism. It includes necrophilia for corpses and all these horrible things. But even under this law. since exhibitionists are not excludedand I have had women tell me they have had people flash themselves. men flash themselves. and they immediately reacted and hit them with a purse. Under that scenario. under this law. the exhibitionist committed a misdemeanor and the woman that hit him with her purse committed a new Federal felony under the hate crimes law. That is absurd. We dont need this law. There is no reason for it. We even tried to include in here specifically the kinds of churches that were invaded and attacked for supporting the California marriage amendment. and that was voted down on a straight party line. There should be no special classes. And the other thing here that would silence Christian ministers and eventually rabbis or imams from quoting the Bible. the Tanach or Koran where it condemns homosexuality. because under this bill if a minister. a rabbi: imam quotes from those scriptures and says homosexuality is an aberrationor whatever language they use. that it is wrong. it hurts societyand some nut hears them and goes out. commits a crime of violence. then under 18 U.S.C. (2)(a) they could be arrested. charged as a principal.

1110068520,Mr. President. throughout my service in the Senate. I have been a strong supporter for health care reform. But we cant allow reform to be used as an excuse to roll back womens rights that they have had for almost half a century. That is why I strongly oppose the amendment offered by my friend. the Senator from Nebraska. I think he is wrong. What this amendment does is remove a womans right to make her own decision. as a practical matter. It is to prohibit any of the health plans on the exchange from covering abortion. It will ban coverage even for women who dont get a dime in Federal subsidy. Womens reproductive rights are always being challenged here in Congress. What about mens reproductive rights? Lets turn the tables for a moment. What if we were to vote on a Viagra amendment restricting coverage for male reproductive services? The same rules would apply for Viagra as being proposed for abortion. Of course. that means no health plan on the exchange would cover Viagra availability. How popular would that demand be around here? I understand that abortion and drugs such as Viagra present different issues. but there is a fundamental principle that is the same: restricting access to reproductive health services for one gender. This amendment is exclusively directed at a womans right to decide for herself. It doesnt dare to challenge mens personal decisions. I have the good fortune of being a father of three daughters and grandfather of six granddaughters. I am deeply concerned by the precedent this amendment would set. I dont want politicians making decisions for my daughters or my granddaughters when it comes to their health and wellbeing. but that is exactly what this amendment does. Nothing made me happier than when any of my daughters announced a pregnancy. I watched them grow and prosper in their health and wellbeing. as they were carrying that child. I was fully prepared to support a decision she might make for the best health of that new baby and protecting her health to be able to offer her love and care for a new child. as I saw in my years. I dont want to stand here and think that somebody is going to make a decision in this room that affects what my granddaughters or my daughters have to think about. If they want to restrict themselves. let them do it. But how can we stand here and permit this to take place when we are trying to make people healthier and better informed? This amendment wants to take away that right. Right now. the majority of private health insurance plans do offer abortion coverage. This amendment would force private health insurance companies to abandon those policies. eliminate services. and limit a womans options. The amendment does not. contrary to statements being made here on the floor. simply preserve the Hyde language that has been in place for more than three decades. Make no mistake. this amendment goes well beyond the concept of limiting Federal funds from paying for abortion. This amendment would make it impossible for a woman who pays for her premiums out of her own pocket to purchase a private health plan that offers her the right to choose what is best for her. for her health. and her familys wellbeing. We have been working hard for a long time to eliminate discrimination against women in our current health care system. Right now. our health care bill takes a balanced approach to abortion coverage. It preserves existing Federal law. Women have fought since this Nations founding to have full rights under the law. including suffrage. including many other things. Unfortunately. this amendment would force them to take a step backward. I dont want to see it happen. I urge my colleagues. please. use your judgment. make your own choices about your own family. Make your decisions as to what you would recommend to a daughter or a wife. But for Gods sake. let the woman choose what is best for her. I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment.

1110008759,I thank the gentleman for yielding. and I think its a prime example of unintended consequences. Since its inception. weve watched as SCHIP has been slowly replacing employer health plans with governmentpaid planswith spiraling costs to taxpayers. Employers discovered that they could avoid their own plans. knowing that their employees would be covered by SCHIP. This was supposed to provide health insurance for poor and workingclass families but. like all things bureaucratic. its now morphed into one in which families earning as much as sixfigure incomes and who would have good employerpaid health insurance are being pushed into the government program. And that is the fine point of it. This is no longer a program for the children of poor people. Its being used to insinuate government into the medical care of every American.

1110063035,Mr. Speaker. today we live in a interconnected world where United States law enforcement agencies routinely help foreign law enforcement as they pursue criminal conduct outside their borders within the United States. I might add that U.S. law enforcement has an identical need for cooperation from their foreign counterparts. This cooperation is essential as we work together to build cases against international organized crime organizations. drug cartels. purveyors of child pornography on the Internet. and other criminal threats from outside our borders. On a regular basis the United States receives requests for assistance in gathering evidence within our borders. For example. when French authorities collect relevant domestic evidence they may discover the likelihood of critical evidence within the United States. In such a case they would submit a request to us for financial records. Internet records. and various other kinds of evidence which they have determined to be relevant to making their case. U.S. Attorneys review the requests and then seek warrants for the evidence as appropriate. When the evidence is collected. the United States transmits it to French authorities. leading to prosecution in French courts. Unfortunately. what should be a simple process is compounded by bureaucratic rules with unintended consequences. This is because under the existing rules. any foreign evidence request must be split up and sent to each district where the evidence exists. So take the French example I just gave. and imagine that the financial records sought are in banks in six different federal judicial districts. that the Internet records are in another five federal judicial districts. and that other documentary evidence is spread over another five districts. Under existing law. sixteen different U.S. Attorneys Offices would have to work on the evidence request. The Foreign Evidence Request Efficiency Act would address this problem by allowing such foreign evidence requests to be handled centrally. by a single or more limited number of U.S. Attorneys offices as appropriate. Rather than sixteen U.S. Attorneys offices being involved the entire operation would be coordinated by one United States Attorneys office. S. 1289 would not alter the type of evidence which may be sought and would therefore have no adverse impact on civil liberties. This legislation would merely eliminate an entirely unnecessary paperwork burden currently imposed on United States Attorneys. Finally. I would suggest that our ability to better assist foreign law enforcement agencies will serve the interests of reciprosity when we ask for their assistance. We need to establish standards of evidence collection here in the United States as an example of what we ourselves expect in our own requests for cooperation of foreign agencies in our criminal investigations which involve foreign jurisdictions. I ask for your support of this important bipartisan legislation. Mr. Speaker. I urge passage of the bill and yield back the balance of my time.,111116940,LUNGREN,DANIEL,H,CA,M,R,3,voting,2009-09-30,173,Mr. DANIEL E.

Even as the President talks about the need to put our economic house in order. this House continues to spend and spend and spend and spend. Clearly. the Congress has lost its way. Not one of the nine spending bills in this omnibus was ever considered by the full committee. Six of the nine bills in this package were never considered by the full Appropriations Committee. One more time were spending hundreds of billions of dollars with no debate. no amendments. no Member input. Yes. clearly. this Congress has lost its way. Its now standard operating procedure that only a handful of Members in leadership are actually involved in writing significant legislation. This has been true with every supplemental spending package the House has considered over the last 2 years. This was true in the development of the $789 billion stimulus package passed by the House just 2 weeks ago. And. that is true once again today. Under this rule just adopted. Members have 1 hour to debate $410 billion in spending. with no opportunity for amendments. That equates to nearly $7 billion for every minute of debate. Sadly. the vast majority of our Members will have no voice whatsoever in crafting this measure. The fiscal year 2009 omnibus bill contains funding for nine of the 12 regular appropriations bills. a total of $410 billion. The new fiscal year began on October 1 and today. nearly 5 months later. were jamming the work that should have been done last year into one massive. lastminute. ""takeitorleaveit"" spending bill. The spending in this legislation represents a $32 billion. or 8 percent increase over last year for the very same agencies and programs. With the exception of the spending boost after the September 11 attacks. this represents the largest annual Federal Government spending increase since 1978. At the very time when our economy is forcing families to make do with less. Congress has embarked on the largest spending spree in our countrys history. When combined with"" the three appropriations bills that were signed into law in September. this enacted fiscal year 2009 budget will become our countrys very first trillion dollar discretionary budget. It comes as no surprise that the $410 billion omnibus spending bill contains funding for many of the same government programs that received funding in the $789 billion stimulus package. Stimulus funding for these nine spending bills totals $270 billion. When added together. the combined fiscal year 2009 funding for government programs in both bills is $680 billionan increase of $301 billion. or an 80 percent increase over just last year. The real surprise is not the unfettered spending but the complete and utter failure of Congress to encourage any fiscal discipline whatsoever. At a time when American families are cutting unnecessary spending to weather the economic downturn. Congress should be doing the same thing. Instead. the premise of PayGo. or ""pay as we go"" is being replaced by the promise GoSpend under this majority. This delirious pace of government spending goes well beyond what most people would consider reasonable. let alone responsible. An 8 percentor a $32 billionincrease in 1 year on top of the stimulus package is simply unnecessary and unsustainable. Balance is what we should strive for. providing enough money to allow the agencies to carry out their primary missions and to achieve real results. Our public has grown weary of Congress simply throwing money at every problem in this country. Spending fatigue has set in. Mr. Speaker. as I commit to working constructively with DAVID OBEY this year. I encourage the majority leadership to pursue regular order that is inclusive of all Members so our work can once again reflect the bipartisan voices of this House.

1110045390,for his dedication to this issue. Over the years. he has acted in a professional and respectful manner in his tireless efforts. his superb leadership. This bill has garnered 185 cosponsors. Mr. MCINTYRES dedication to the Lumbee people is most admirable. and Im sure they recognize and salute him for that dedication. I would also like to commend the Lumbee Tribe for being extremely patient with Congress as we have failed to clarify their status for far too long. In the face of adversity. their determination and sheer stamina has served as testament to their belief in who they are as a people. They have endured rejection by Congress. hostility by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. and have even been snubbed in their quest by neighboring Indian tribes unwilling to have the Lumbee recognized the Congress as they were. All the Lumbee want is the respect of being acknowledged for who they arean American Indian tribe. Let us join this effort to grant the Lumbee the recognition they have so long deserved.

1110065774,"Mr. Speaker. in the 72 hours we were allowed. Republicans weeded through thousands of pages of bureaucratic provisions. mandates. programs and spending. Despite its monstrous size. this health care takeover has come down to a few clear. evident points: it raises taxes. raises premiums. increases health care costs. and dumps trillions of dollars of debt on our children and grandchildren. Small businesses and families will bear the weight of this bill for generations. We all agree that health care reform is urgently needed. but this bill destroys the American health care system as opposed to improving it. Instead of incentivizing the private market to offer more affordable health care coverage options. it punishes small businesses and their employees. It threatens jail time for individuals who do not purchase insurance and could soon lead to the rationing of care. depriving Americans of lifesaving treatments that are not deemed ""costeffective."" Even doctors. the most experienced in this health care debate. oppose this proposal and have shared concerns of the many clinics and hospitals that will be forced to reduce or deny services. The over 2.000 page spending plan imposes nearly $800 billion in new taxes on individuals. families and small businesses. It places mandates on both individuals and employers which. according to the Presidents Economic Advisor. will result in the loss of up to 5.5 million jobs. These mandates will also discourage the hiring of lowwage and minority workers. In the face of both a recession and a 10.2% unemployment rate. Speaker PELOSIs unprecedented taxandspend approach will come at the expense of American citizens. Moreover. while the majority of Americans are happy with their health care coverage. an estimated 114 million Americans will lose their insurance under Speaker PELOSIs plan and be dumped into the governmentrun option. The plan also cuts more than $170 billion from Medicare Advantage plans. jeopardizing millions of seniors existing coverage. The bill puts the government in the middle of Americans personal health care decisions. as opposed to reform based on improving the quality and affordability of health care. While Democrats have continually touted the benefits of a public option. they themselves voted against an amendment to require enrollment for Members of Congress. This speaks volumes to the true quality of a government plan. as what I view as adequate coverage for the American public would also be adequate for my family. Furthermore. the bill also abolishes the private health insurance market. forcing all individuals to purchase coverage through a governmentcontrolled Exchange and eliminating choices from the health care system. While this bill takes care of Members of Congress. it eliminates the freedom of choice for the American public. Republicans have introduced numerous bills to provide improvements in the cost and delivery of health care. but we have been denied a seat at the table. Behind closed doors. the Democrats crafted a monstrosity of a bill to take over one sixth of the economy. and then limited floor debate to four or five hours on one of the most sweeping pieces of legislation we have ever seen. The Republican alternative provides a commonsense approach to the main problems in our health care system. It would lower premiums. decrease health care costs. reign in federal spending. and allow for more options. choice. and innovation in the health care system. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that average premiums under the Republican alternative would be almost $5.000 less than under the Democratic plan in 2016. It would provide incentive grants for states to further lower premiums. and allow businesses to innovate ways to promote health and wellness and curb health care spending. The alternative would also expand high risk pools. prohibit insurance companies from denying individuals with preexisting conditions. and ensure interstate purchasing of health insurance. These reforms would drive down the costs of health care to make it more affordable for Americans while also protecting the choice and numerous options that citizens need. I have spoken to many health care professionals in my District as well as held town halls with my constituents. and both have expressed not only their opposition. but their fear. of this government takeover of health care. We are not listening to Americans. and we are missing the opportunity to use insight from the experts in the field to enact meaningful reform.

1110046276,Madam Speaker. I respond to my colleague from California and my colleague from Texas in this way. My colleague from California knows that I support him in his efforts to try and solve the California water crisis. and. in fact. I have been a leader in trying to do that. I dont always agree. I have come to this House floor and argued with my own leadershfip with regard to the issues that have dealt with the causes of the California regulatory drought. I would also like to remind the gentleman. who loves to blame the Democrats for everything that .goes wrong. that it was a Republican bill and a Republican judge that put both of those concerns that are causing much of our water problems on the map. With regard to my friend from Texas and his claim that this is all about the cost. I can tell you that as an adoptive parent. if I hadnt taken the actions I did by adopting two children. they would not have filled the place they hold in my heart. but they would have also cost the Federal Government much. much more. When we. take kids out of an abusive home and put them into foster care. we do so in order to try and recapture their lives.. My children caie out of a home where they were being neglected and abused by a drugaddicted mother. The scars that they will carry from that time in their lives are profound. Had I not had the ability to spend time with them. the challenges that we face with the emotional difficulties of those young people that I love so much would be. in fact.- much worse than they are even today. The gentleman can talk about how this is a cost issue. but let me tell you. if people cant get the time to do what is right about adopting young kids. they wont do that. And it will cost the Federal Government much more. We argued this in a bill last year where we gave the opportunity for our troops to adopt young peopleand take that leave. It was the right thing to do then. and it passed. Last year. this bill was on the floor. and 58 of the gentlemans colleagues from Texas voted in support of this. This is the right thing to do for our country. It is the right thing to do for our kids. I believe in it. profoundly. And. yes. this government wastes a lot of money in many different -ways. but I can tell you that money spent in this area on this particular set of young people that I have talked about so much today is money well spent and will pay dividends many times over in the future. I have no question about that. At this time. Madam Speaker.

1110057931,Mr. President. there are a select few men and women who come to work every day with one primary job: to protect those of us who are fortunate enough to call the U.S. Capitol Building our office and all who come here from all corners of the country to see for themselves the heart of our democracy. Special Agent John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut were two such men. Every day for almost two decades they kept us safe. Eleven years ago today. as the Chaplain announced in his prayer. they gave their lives while protecting us. On this day in 1998. a madman came through an entrance on the east side of the building in midafternoon and shot Officer Chestnut at pointblank range. Officer Chestnut died instantly. Agent Gibson confronted the man. shooting him and stopping him. Gibson was himself hit. and he died later that day. I can clearly remember both these brave men. both of whom were in their 18th year of service as Capitol policemen when they were killed. I can remember when my wife became ill at a congressional retreat we had in Virginia. It was Agent Gibson who ran to her side. I can remember how he was so focused and had run so far from the Capitol Police headquarters to our room. he was sweating profusely. and how he treated her with kindness and care. Agent Gibson. who was from Massachusetts. would. every morning. race to the back of the sports section when baseball season was on to find the box score for his beloved Boston Red Sox. He was a generous neighbor and loving father to his daughter and two sons. Officer Chestnut. whom everyone called J.J.. was a father of five who loved his job and loved his country. He had served in the Air Force for 20 years. He fought in Vietnam. At the time of the shooting. he was just weeks away from retiring. Gibson and Chestnut lay in honor in the Capitol Rotunda. just steps from where they were murdered. a distinction Congress has conferred upon only a handful of Americans. including Abraham Lincoln. John Kennedy. and our unknown soldiers. Jacob Chestnut was the first African American to ever be so honored in the Capitol Rotunda. On this solemn anniversary. we pause to appreciate not just the bravery of two men who saved so many others but each and every Capitol police officer who does his or her job so valiantly every single day of the year. On behalf of the entire Senate. everyone who works and visits here.

1110009821,"Mr. President. the amendment I have is a product of a lot of work from a number of Senators on this side of the aisle. I especially thank Senator MARTINEZ of Florida. a great leader on this issue. along with Senator THUNE. Senator GRAHAM. and many other Senators who have been involved in this discussion. This is an alternative we believe would truly create jobs and stimulate our economy. The total cost is around $421 billion. I wish. before I describe the amendmentand I know others of my colleagues want to discuss this amendmentI wish to point out it is very clear that public opinion in this country is swinging against the proposal that is now before the Senate and was passed by the other body. They are opposed because they see now in the Senate a $995 billion package which could reach more than $1.2 trillion. Many Americans. certainly now a majority. do not see it as a way to create jobs and to stimulate our economy. They see it loaded down with unnecessary spending programs. They see it. very correctly. with policy changes which deserve extended debate and voting on their own. such as ""Buy American"" provisions. DavisBacon. giving Federal workers new whistleblower protections. Some of these policy changes may be laudable. others are not. at least in my view. but all of them deserve debate and discussion rather than being placed in a piece of legislation that is intended to stimulate our economy and create jobs. I think it is time that we also understand. how we got where we are. I have been around this body long enough to recognize that we are now entering the final phase of consideration of this package. Whether it be today or over the weekend or early next week. this bill will be disposed of one way or another by the Senate. So how did we get to where we are today. with a $995 billion package. at least. ot $1.2 trillion. or perhaps more than that. with a bill that probably would create. in the view of the administrationand I do not agree with it3 million jobs. which would mean that each job that is created by it costs the taxpayers $275.000. I do not think many Americans believe that each job created should cost $275.000 of their hardearned tax dollars. In fact. the response my office is getting borders on significant anger when we talk about many of the funding programs that are in the stimulus bill. I will go through several of them later on. but $400 million for STD prevention. $40 million to make park services more qnergy efficient. $75 million for smoking cessation. It is hard to argue that. even though these provisions. many of them. may be worthwhile. they actually create jobs. So we have strayed badly from our original intent of creating a situation in America to reverse the terrible decline and economic ditch in which we find the American economy. to the point we have had spending programs and policy provisions which have nothing to do with stimulating the economy and creating jobs. It may be Governmentlet me put it this way. It may be legislative activity. possibly. at its worst. We are offering today an alternative at less than half the cost that we think creates jobs and stimulates the economy. I remind my colleagues. despite the rhetoric about bipartisanship. this bill originated in the House of Representatives. as is constitutionally appropriate. There was no Republican input whatsoever. It passed the other body on a strict partyline basis with the loss of 11 Democrats and came over to this body. where in both the Appropriations and the Finance Committees. almost every Republican amendment was rejected on party lines. I appreciate very much that the President of the United States came over to address Republican Members of the Senate and Republican Members of the House. The tenor of his remarks I think was excellent. But the fact is. we did not sit down and seriously negotiate between Republican and Democrat. I have been involved in many bipartisan efforts in this body. for many years. that have achieved legislative result. The way you achieve it is not to come over and talk to a body. The answer is to sit down and seriously negotiate and come up with compromises which result in legislation which -is good for the country. That has not happened in this process. Again. the American people are figuring it out. I am confident. because of the way this process has taken place. that gap. which is now 4337. the majority of the American people opposing this package. will grow. A majority of the American people still believe we have to stimulate the economy and create jobs. I agree with them. But to spend $1.2 trillion on it. and have no provision for when the economy recovers to put us back on the path of fiscal sanity and stabilityas the amendment that I had last night was rejected. we got 44 votedoes not provide the American people with confidence that spending will stop at some time. One thing they have learned is that spending programs that are initially supposed to be temporary become permanent. They become permanent. That is a historical fact. So we have initiated nearly $1 trillionmany in new spending. some hundreds of billions of dollars in new spendingwith no provision. once the economy has recoveredand the economy will recover in Americathis is no path to balancing the budget. Instead. we laid a $700 billion debt on future generations of America in the form of TARP. we are laying $1.2 trillion additional in the form of this bill. and another half a trillion dollars in the omnibus appropriations bill. and then we are told. there will be a necessity for another TARP. which could be as much as $1 trillion. because of our declining economy. Yet there has been no provision whatsoever. once the economy recovers. to put us back on a path to balancing the budget and reducing and perhaps eliminatinghopefully eliminatingthis debt we have laid on future generations of Americans. I used to come down to the floor here. and have over the years. and argue against provisions in appropriations billswhich. by the way. has led to corruption. I notice there is another individual staffer who is being charged today. or yesterday. for inappropriate behavior with Mr. Abramoff. There used to be hundreds of thousands and sometimes thousands. Now. they are in the millions and billions. tens of millions and billions. My how we have grown. Do we need $1 billion for national security at the Nuclear Security Administration Weapons Activities to create jobs? We may need $1 billion for National Nuclear Security Administration Weapons Activity. but to say it will create jobs and will stimulate the economy is a slender reed. There is nobody who appreciates more than this person the contribution that Filipino war veterans made to winning the Second World War. We are going to give millions of dollars to those who live in the Philippines. Do not label that as job stimulation. Smoking cessation is something that we all support. How does $75 million for smoking cessation create jobs within the next years that would justify expenditures of $75 million? This body. in the name of increasing health care for children. raised taxes by some $61 billion. I guess it is. on tobacco use. So we now hope people will use tobacco in order to pay for insurance for children. But the fact is. $75 million for smoking cessation should be an issue that is brought up separately and on its own. And the list goes on and on and on. Our proposalI am grateful for the participation of so many Senatorswould allocate approximately $275 billion in tax cuts. It would eliminate the 3.1 percent payroll tax for all employees for 1 year and use general revenues to pay for the Social Security obligation. It would allocate $60 billion to lower the 10percent tax bracket to 5 percent for 1 year. It would lower the 15percent tax bracket to 10 percent for 1 year. It would lower corporate tax brackets from 35 percent to 25 percent for 1 year. We alarmed the world with the ""Buy American"" provisions which are included in this bill. The reaction has been incredible. and the fact is. jobs flee America for a number of reasons. But one of them is we have the highest business taxes of any nation in the world. We used to have among the lowest. So if we really want to create jobs in America and attract capital and investment for the United States of America. we need to lower the corporate tax bracket. We need to have accelerated depreciation for capital investments for small businesses. We need to assist Americans in need. there is no doubt about that. There are Americans who are wounded and are hurting today. It is not their fault. We need to extend the unemployment insurance benefits. That is a $38 billion pricetag. We need to extend food stamps. We need to extend unemployment insurance benefits. make them tax free. That is a $10 billion pricetag. And. of course. we need to provide workers with training and employment. That is a $50 billion cost. We need to keep families in their homes. We needed. and we did adopt last night. the $15.000 tax credit. But we also need to fund the increase in the fee that servicers receive from continuing a mortgage and avoiding foreclosure. We need to have GSE and FHA conforming loan limits.. That is $32 billion. We also. by the way. need to do more in the housing area. You know. it is interesting in all of these spending proposals we have. there is not one penny for defense. not one penny. Obviously. we are going to have to reset our military. We need to replace the aging equipment that has been used so heavily in Iraq and will be needed in Afghanistan. We need to improve and repair and modernize the barracks. the facilities and infrastructure that directly support the readiness and training of the Armed Forces. We do not have that in the now $995 billion package that is before us. Obviously. we need to spend money on military construction projects which will create jobs immediately. Those people who say that is not the case. I can provide for the record adequate information that many of our military construction projects could begin more quickly than those that are not on our military bases because of environmental and other concerns. We need to spend $45 billion on transportation infrastructure. There are grants to States to build and repair roads and bridges. including $10 billion for discretionary transportation grants. and $1 billion for roads on Federal lands. Public transit. obviously. we need to fund. and airport infrastructure improvements are necessary. along with small business loans. That is about $63 billion in our proposal. Finally. the American people believe. and I think correctly. spending is out of control in our Nations Capital. We continue to spend and spend and spend. We not only have accumulated over a $10 trillion deficit. this will add another $1 trillion or more. I mentioned the TARP of $700 billion. all of which is being paid forwe are printing money in order to fund it. At some point we are going to have to get our budget balanced or our children and our grandchildren are going to pay the bill. I recommend that this body hear as much as possible from David Walker. former head of the Government Accountability Office. in the Congress of the United States. He paints a stark picture. In my view. it is also time that we establish entitlement commissions: one for Social Security and one for MedicareMedicaid and make recommendations so we can act on what is a multitrilliondollar deficit in Social Security and over a $40 trillion debt on Medicare and Medicaid. Unless we address these longterm entitlement issues. there is no way we are going to be able to prevent the majority of Americans taxes from being devoted to those two programs. So we need to establish those commissions and we need to put them to work and we need to put them to work right away. Now. I am told there is general agreement. Why not do it now? Why not do it now? We also need better accountability. better transparency. better oversight. and better results. Among many disappointments we have over TARP. one was that we were told the Congress and the American people would have oversight and transparency. and they would know exactly how that initial $350 billion was being spent. The American people and Members of Congress have been bitterly disappointed as TARP shifted from one priority to another. Funds went to the automotive industry. which none of us had anticipated when we voted for and approved it. We need more transparency and accountability and oversight of how this. probably the biggest single emergency spending package in the history of this country. is being spent. I notice I have other Members here who wish to speak on this issue. I hope we can pass this alternative. some $421 billion. to what has now surged to over $1 trillion. It probably may not pass for the reasons of numbers. but if we do not sit down and negotiate and come up with a package that is more than a $50- or $60- or $80 billion reduction. when we are talking about $1.2 trillion. the American people will not be well served. They will not be well served by requiring DavisBacon. they will not be well served by requiring ""Buy American."" they will not be well served by spending their hardearned dollars on unnecessary programs that even though in the eyes of some may have virtue. have no or very little association with job creation and relief for Americans who are struggling to stay in their homes and* either keep their jobs or go out and find a new one. I believe the United States of America will recover from the economic crisis. I have a fundamental faith. belief. that American workers are the most productive. the most innovative. and the best in the world. But they need some help right now. What they need is the right kind of help. I urge my colleagues. when you see the money that is being spent in the name of job creation and stimulus that is laying a debt burden on our children and our grandchildren. we need to have serious consideration of this kind of spending because it is not fair. not only to this generation of Americans but to future generations as well.

1110033175,Mr. President. the second point I wish to make before I get to my formal remarks is on the question the Senator from Arizona raised about how big of an incentive is enough to get reported. That is a legitimate question. Here is my experience with 22 years of the False Claims Act. dealing with whistleblowers. Government agencies listening to whistleblowers or not. the Justice Department taking a case or not taking a case. or whether the whistleblower initiates the case on their own. What I have found is that the False Claims Act does not come up early in anybodys thought processabout initiating a thought process that there might be fraud out there and somebody ought to be investigating and get to the bottom of it. Usually. the whistleblower has ample evidence of that or they wouldnt be doing it in the first place. They jeopardize their profession and their job in Government. That isnt right. but whistleblowers who want to do the patriotic thing actually jeopardize their professional future. What I have found is they dont even know about the False Claims Act or about getting a percentage of it. They dont even know about whistleblower protection laws. They want to do the patriotic thing. They want to report fraud. So to talk about the award being the incentive to come forward. I dont want to say that in some cases that may not be the case. but in most cases these are patriotic people knowing about the fraudulent use of taxpayer money. they think it is wrong and ought to stop. and they think it ought to stop within the agency. They dont get anywhere with the agency. so they come to other people. and eventually along the line. probably. somebody says: You need to take this to court. and you can get something out of this if you win and if you have a case. Probably the majority of them dont win. So they get nothing out of it. But they are trying to be patriotic citizens. I think that bringing up the issue of how much of an award is big enough to get this information out should not even be a part of the debate. It is still something because we are talking about taxpayer money and what is an incentive to do this. but it ought to be discussed in a thoughtful way. not on an amendment to a bill that is trying to correct a few bad court decisions to get the False Claims Act back to its original purpose. I thank the Senator from Vermont for letting me cooperate with him on this issue. The Senator from Vermont also recognizes that the False Claims Act is a very useful tool against fraud. which is the overall purpose of the rest of Senator LEAHYs and my bill. The other thing you have to remember is that this has brought in $22 billion. Senator LEAHY made that very clear. There are so many court cases I can tell you about where the Government. through the Justice Department. came in and tried to belittle the whistleblower. the claimant. to reduce. or even eliminate. any access to an award. how many times judges have had to berate people in the Justice Department. I am not talking about Presidents Obama. Bush. Reagan. Bush 1. or Clinton. I am talking about several of them where you wouldnt even have a casein other words. saying to the prosecutor and the Justice Department: Do you realize you would not even have had a case without this patriotic whistleblower coming forward? More recently. there has been a case where the Justice Department asked not to proceed forward. The judge stepped in and said: We are going to go forward. there is something wrong here. and we are going to get to the bottom of it.  So we have $22 billion back because of patriotic Americans. Do you know what. Just because the False Claims Act has been out there. it has been a preventive to fraud. like all the other tools Senator LEAHY has in this bill that will not only help with prosecution. but the possibility of prosecution is going to be a preventive factor. So I feel strongly that if the issue of an award limit comes up. it ought to be discussed thoroughly and thoughtfully in a toolthe False Claims Actwhich has proven its worth by $22 billion and a lot of unknown preventable fraud out there. We ought to think through it thoughtfully. I want this amendment defeated. The False Claims Act is the No. 1 tool for recovering taxpayer dollars lost to waste. fraud. and abuse. Whistleblowers who bring fraud cases on behalf of the Government. known as qui tam relators. often risk everything to uncover truth. Currently. the False Claims Act provides a reward to whistleblowers who come forward with goodfaith allegations of fraud. waste. or abuse of Government dollars. They are allowed to file a lawsuit on behalf of the Federal Government. and the case remains under judicial seal in Federal court. The Justice Department then decides to join a case or not join a case. If the Justice Department joins a case and the case is successful. a whistleblower can recover 15 to 25 percent of the funds recovered. If the Justice Department does not jointhen it is going to be a much more difficult process for the whistleblower and his or her counselthe whistleblower can go forward with the case and if they are successful.. they can recover more. somewhere between 25 and 30 percent. depending upon the judge. While some are arguing that this represents a windfall for whistleblowers. the statistics paint a different picture. In fact. in cases where the Department of Justice joins the whistleblower. the average share for the whistleblower is not 25 percent or 30 percent. it is 16 percent. Compare that 16 percent with the percentage it takes to administer Government generally. throughout Governmentabout 12 percent. Do you. Mr. President. think there are enough people in the Justice Department. enough FBI people to know where all the skeletons are buried. where all the frauds are being committed? No. This average award is not too far out of line with the average administrative costs of Government. There have been 6.197 qui tam complaints filed since 1986 which have resulted in $13.7 billion in recoveries to the Federal Government. That averages about $2.2 million recovered for complaint filed. In these 6.197 cases. the Government has paid qui tam whistleblowers $2.2 billion in awards. That means the average share award for a qui tam whistleblower is about $350.000. This is hardly a windfall that one would seek. particularly if one is ruining their professional career by being a whistleblower. coming forth to do what is patriotic. to do what is right. It is. in fact. an incentive that helps fuel complaints coming in. However. if we start adding new caps to the already existing whistleblower caps. we could reduce the incentive for whistleblowers to proceed through the casesor coming forward in the first placethat would help us then recover billions of dollars. I wish to share the story of Tina Gonter who was a qui tam whistleblower who testified before the Judiciary Committee last year. Ms. Gonter worked closely with the Government and went undercover at the company for months collecting documents and evidence of a fraud against the Navy. She even wore a wire for the Federal agents of the Defense Department. Ultimately. a couple of individuals went to jail as a result of Ms. Gonters work. But the Government refused to sue the contractor for fraud. Believe that. the Government refused to sue with obvious evidence. Ms. Gonter filed a false claims case against the company. and it was not joined by our own Justice Department. The judge in that case even scolded the Justice Department and the Navy for not joining the case. Ultimately. Ms. Gonter prevailed. and the contractor paid over $13 million to the Federal Government. Ms. Gonter received a share of that money. but had she not brought this case. the Justice Department and the Defense Department would have been satisfied with simply putting two people in jail and allowing the contractor to walk away with the money it received for providing fraudulent product to the Navy. And it is not just a case of fraudulent product to the Navy. It is a serious safety matter for the people in the military who put their lives on the line in the defense of our freedom. That is only one example out of 6.197 that the False Claims Act provides power to get fraudulent activity under control. It is a check on the power of the Government bureaucracy to look the other waythat is what the Justice Department did in this caseand pretend that fraud did not happen on their watch. However. it is fueled by courageous whistleblowers. such as Tina Gonter. and without sufficient financial incentives to come forward and fight these cases for 5 to 10 years they can take in court. we may lose this valuable tool against fraud. It is about recovering money. taxpayers money. I find it ironicI hope people are listening now because there is a conflict here between maybe people on my side of the aisle who think this is a good ideaI find it very ironic that those outside groups supporting this amendment were in staunch opposition to the idea of the Senate imposing any caps on executive compensation at companies receiving bailout funds. Now instead. they want to cap the recovery of goodfaith whistle-. blowers to come forward with claims of fraud at companies that are ripping off American taxpayers. The False Claims Act works and will continue to work if we do not cut the incentives for relators to go to court. The law already has a cap for whistleblower recoveries. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment which is based on a couple of extreme examples from outlier cases that are not the norm. We have $22 billion coming in under this act. Early on. we fought the. defense industry to get this bill passed. and the defense industry tried to gut it after. it was passed. When they could not because they did not have the proper prestige. they came to the American hospital industry to fight a front for them. That did not happen. I dont know exactly what groups are out there now backing all this. But when are you ever going to realize that in this country. the taxpayers deserve some respect? And if there is fraud in your industry. it is no holds barred on the recovery and the preventing of fraud.

1110051196,Mr. Chairman. as the ranking member on the committee. I feel an obligation just to make a comment to kind of put things in perspective. particularly as the American people are watching. because I think what were doing today is setting a very bad and a dangerous precedent. Ive been around the House for. a while. and Ive been involved in debates on scores of appropriations bills. Traditionally. whether its been Democrats or Republicans in the majority. weve had open rules on tpending bills. and a respectful working relationship across the aisle. and thats the way it should be. and thats what the American people expect. a cooperative attitude and the opportunity for full scrutiny of how their tax dollars are being spent. I didnt like the preprinting requirement for amendments that the majority instituted to start the appropriations process on the floor this session with the CommerceJusticeScience bill. I supported an open rule so that every Member could have the opportunity to review the entire bill. and if there were programs that Members believed could be cut. then we could debate that amendment and the House could work its will.  So we started the process late last night to debate the preprinted amendments. And 21 minutes into the amendment debate. the chairman of the committee pulled the plug on that process and on the Members who. really. in good faith. followed the instructions of the preprinting. They went up. they did everything that was asked of them. The rules. Mr. Chairman. were then changed in the middle of the night. and now we have even a more controlled process. SMembers on.my side. and I think if youkind of do unto others as you would have them do unto you can think. if you were in that situation and had gone through the same thing the guys on our side. Members on our side. how you would feel. Members on my side have the right to have their voice heard and offer amendments to control spending. Members on both sides had substantive. thoughtful amendments. Members on my side have the right to have their voice heard and offer amendments. whatever they may be. to control spending or whatever. Members on both sides also have substantive and thoughtful amendments that were germane and in order. and now those Members have lost the opportunity to offer them. For example. Mr. ROGERS from Michigan. who was an FBI agent. who went. to Afghanistan.

1110047319,"Madam Speaker. Members of Congress in the House and the Senate get literature sent to them every single day. In fact. we probably get four or five books a week. I dont know how many little leaflets and pamphlets were asked to read. but we dont have time to read them all. We ask our staff to read some of them. but we dont have a chance to really get into the minutiae of some of these brochures. Our colleagues in both the House and the Senate got this little booklet called ""The State of the Unions Finances. a Citizens Guide."" These are going to be given. I guess. to people all across this country. I hope every one of my colleagues and everybody in America gets a chance to read this little booklet. Now. this was sent to us by our colleagues FRANK WOLF. Republican of Virginia. and JIm COOPER. Democrat of Tennessee. I just want to read to you a little bit about the situation that America faces.. because Americans right now. I dont think. are really aware of the fiscal problems were facing. As of the fall of 2008. we had $12.2 trillion in explicit liabilities. Thats lJublicly held debt. military and civilian pensions. retiree health benefits. and others things related to that. We had $1.3 trillion in debt for Federal insurance. loan guaranties. leases. and so forth. and we had a $42.9 trillion debt from Medicare hospital insurance. Medicare outpatient services. Medicare prescription drugs. and Social Security. Thats a total of $56.4 trillion in debt that we have right now. today. That amounts to $184.000 of debt for every man. woman. and child in this country. it amounts to $435.000 of debt for a fulltime worker. for each household. it amounts to $483.000 in debt. Thats the national debt today. George Washington said we should avoid ungenerously throwing upon posterity. our kids. the burden we. ourselves. ought to bear. In 1796. they had a deficit. and George Washington said that we cant allow this to happen because we dont want to leave a burden to our kids and to our grandkids by spending too much money. Im telling you right now. colleagues and anybody else who is paying attention. what were going to leave our kids and our grandkids is something that they will curse us for because theyre going to have to pay extreniely high taxes. and the inflationary problems that theyre going to face are going to be insurmountable. I cant believe that were doing this right now. Were talking about a national health care program thats going to add additional trillions of dollars. Were talking about bailouts to the financial institutions and to the auto industry. Were talking about a capandtrade program thats going to increase the cost of every family in America between $3.000 and $4.000 to turn on their lights or to buy gasoline at a service station or anything else that produces energy. Were adding about $2 trillion a year to this debt. and its unsustainable. It is going to affect every man. woman. and child who is living in America today. but what its going to do to future generations is unbelievable. We can destroy this Republic. if we dont get control of spending. This is a political hyperbole. Im telling you right now that we can destroy this form of government and this civilization we have. just like Rome did. if we dont get control of spending. Itis out of control. It is out of control. Were $56 trillion in debt today. and were adding $2 trillion a year. plus all of these additional programs were coming up with. In the next 5 years. they say were going to spend an additional $5 trillion. We dont have it. so were putting this burden on our kids and on our grandkids. Its wrong. Wehave to do something about it. We have to do it now. We have to start getting our spending in order. My Republican and Democrat colleagues understand that. Mr. WOLF is a Republican who sent this out. and Mr. COOPER is a Democrat.

Despite her apparently poor..health. Suu Kyl is being housedin Insein be* cause she is standing trial fot the dubious charge of -permitting a misguided. American to enter her home. Sadly. Suu Kyi has already spent 13 of her last 19 birthdays under house arrest. and if convicted of these trumpedup charges by the Burmese regime. she could spend the next 5 birthdays in this foul prison. The best gift Suu Kyi can receive for her birthday is for the regime to display some uncommon good sense and free her and other Burmese prisoners of conscience. My colleagues and I are committed to standing with her and the people of Burma for as long as it takes for that to occur. I suggest the absence of a quorum.,111118361,MCCONNELL,MITCH,S,KY,M,R,,voting,2009-06-19,17,Mr. MCCONNELL,556,586,06192009.txt,953,168,111,2009,mr presid nobel peac prize laureat aung san suu kyi turn today unfortun spend birthday compani famili friend burma notori prison polit prison die sinc despit appar suu kyl caus stand trial fot dubiou charg permit misguid american enter home sadli suu kyi alreadi spent last birthday hous arrest convict trumpedup charg burmes regim could spend next birthday foul prison best gift suu kyi receiv birthday regim display uncommon good sens free burmes prison conscienc colleagu commit stand peopl burma long take occur suggest absenc quorum,90,FALSE

1110075818,Mr. President. today I rise to honor the career of Jim Pitcock. a valuable staff member and more importantly a valuable part of the Arkansas community. Jim has been faithful and selfless in his service to the State of Arkansas. and his contributions will be sorely missed by me. my staff. and the many Arkansans who have had the great fortune of working with this wonderful public servant. Jim has served on my staff from the very first day of my tenure as a Member of the U.S. Senate. His knowledge of the State of Arkansas and government has guided some of my most important decisions and for that I will be forever grateful. His wise. steady council is always held in high esteem. Jim has served several roles on my staff. His most recent role as senior caseworker has benefitted the people of Arkansas by assisting individuals. businesses and organizations that are experiencing difficulties with Federal agencies. Jims leadership has set an expectation of excellence in constituent services. Prior his work in the U.S. Senate. Jim was already a legend in Arkansas. He served as news director at Channel 7 in Little Rock for more than 30 years. During this time. Jim established an unprecedented system of archiving news coverage for historical purposes. Jim has witnessed and archived news from Governors Faubus to Huckabee and Presidents Johnson to Clinton. He also provided critical coverage of major events in our State. such as the Damascus missile explosion. the Cuban refugee crisis and the great Arkansas Texas shootout football game of 1969. Following his departure from television. I was privileged to have Jim join my staff in the Arkansas attorney generals office in 2001 serving as the public information officer. After so many years of faithful service to the people of Arkansas. Jim Pitcock has made a decision to retire from the Senate and his presence will be missed. He will continue to be a friend and adviser to me and I wish him all the best of luck as he begins this new chapter in his life. Mr. President. I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the outstanding career and service of Jim Pitcock to the U.S. Senate and the State of Arkansas.,111117451,PRYOR,MARK,S,AR,M,D,,voting,2009-12-23,380,Mr. PRYOR,21675,21739,12232009.txt,2174,375,111,2009,mr presid today rise honor career jim valuabl staff member importantli valuabl part arkansa commun jim faith selfless servic state arkansa contribut sore miss staff mani arkansan great fortun work wonder public servant jim serv staff first day tenur member us senat knowledg state arkansa govern guid import decis forev grate wise steadi council alway held high esteem jim serv sever role staff recent role senior casework benefit peopl arkansa assist individu busi organ experienc difficulti feder agenc jim leadership set expect excel constitu servic prior work us senat jim alreadi legend arkansa serv news director channel littl rock year time jim establish unpreced system archiv news coverag histor purpos jim wit archiv news governor faubu huckabe presid johnson clinton also provid critic coverag major event state damascu missil explos cuban refuge crisi great arkansa texa shootout footbal game follow departur televis privileg jim join staff arkansa attorney gener offic serv public inform offic mani year faith servic peopl arkansa jim made decis retir senat presenc miss continu friend advis wish best luck begin new chapter life mr presid ask colleagu join celebr outstand career servic jim us senat state arkansa,194,FALSE
1110019308,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 38. which authorizes the use of the Capitol grounds for the 28th National Peace Officers Memorial Service. According to the National Law Enforcement Fund. 140 Federal. State. and local law enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty in 2008. These officers will be honored at this memorial service. During 2008. 15 women officers were killed. the average age of all officers killed was 40 years. and the average years of service was 12 years. According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. there are more than 900.000 sworn law enforcement officers now serving in the United States. In 1962. President John F. Kennedy signed a proclamation which designated May 15 as Peace Officers Memorial Day. and the week in which that date falls as Police Week. This first official memorial service took place on May 15. 1982. at which 91 law enforcement officers were honored. Over the past 28 years. the memorial servic% has honored over 3.000 law enforcement officers from around our Nation. This event has become one in a series of wellattended events during Police Week. I urge support for this resolution. Activities on the Capitol grounds conducted under House Concurrent Resolution 38 will be coordinated with the Office of the Architect of the Capitol. and will be free and open to the public. I support this resolution and urge its passage. I reserve the balance of my time.,111119300,EDWARDS,DONNA,H,MD,F,D,4,voting,2009-03-10,131,Ms. EDWARDS of Maryland,3795,3848,03102009.txt,1518,255,111,2009,mr speaker yield time may consum mr speaker rise support hous concurr resolut author use capitol ground th nation peac offic memori servic accord nation law enforc fund feder state local law enforc offic kill line duti offic honor memori servic women offic kill averag age offic kill year averag year servic year accord nation law enforc offic memori fund sworn law enforc offic serv unit state presid john kennedi sign proclam design may peac offic memori day week date fall polic week first offici memori servic took place may law enforc offic honor past year memori servic honor law enforc offic around nation event becom one seri wellattend event polic week urg support resolut activ capitol ground conduct hous concurr resolut coordin offic architect capitol free open public support resolut urg passag reserv balanc time,137,FALSE
1110037648,Mr. President. we are asking for a simple change that in no way affects the amendment. in no way affects whether it is going to cost anything. The purpose of the underlying amendment is to ensure that tenants of multifamily housing across the country benefit from the same attention and support of this Government as singlefamily hpmeowners will. We have literally millions of tenants--millionswho. because the homes which they rent are foreclosed. are in very bad shape. They can be removed from their homes. Their homes can deteriorate. Once a home is in foreclosure. often it is not kept up. This is not just in big cities such asNew York but around the country. In fact. States such as Tennessee and so many others are on the list which I listed of 15 States that are most affected because it affects not only big multiple dwellings but garden apartments and other residential units. It is unfortunate that the objection is going to stand in the way of helping these tenants.,111121251,SCHUMER,CHARLES,S,NY,M,D,,voting,2009-05-06,97,Mr. SCHUMER,2483,2510,05062009.txt,979,170,111,2009,mr presid ask simpl chang way affect amend way affect whether go cost anyth purpos underli amend ensur tenant multifamili hous across countri benefit attent support govern singlefamili liter million home rent foreclos bad shape remov home home deterior home foreclosur often kept big citi york around countri fact state tennesse mani other list list state affect affect big multipl dwell garden apart residenti unit unfortun object go stand way help tenant,75,FALSE
1110034571,Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I might consume. I would like to congratulate my good friend from Virginia. Mr. SCOTT. for in the chart that he had before us it illustrated the fact that the economic downturn actually began in the last quarter of the Clinton administration. and that chart correctly points to that. So I congratulate my friend for recognizing that. It was the policies put into place in 2001 and in 2003 that brought ahout 55 months of uninterrupted job creation and economic growth and a dramatic increase in the flow of revenues because of the growthoriented tax policies that we did. in fact. implement. I also would point to the fact. and while my friebd proceeds to malign the Bush administration. that its obviously very clear. too. that we as Republicans had the majority when we saw the economic growth that took place in the late 1990s.

1110066570,"Mr. President. from media reports. certainly not because Members on this side of the aisle have been told about it. I understand the majority leader is now corralling the final three Democrats. which I am sure he will succeed in doing. in order to secure 60 votes to move forward with the greatest takeover of the private sector in health care by legislation perhaps in the history of this country. Of course. I would not know that myself. nor would any Member on this side of the aisle. because of the fact that there is no communication between the majority leader and Republicans. I understand they have 60 votes. I understand they will get 60 votes. I understand that they may likely be able to railroad this through the Senate. Then. again. they will gather in a small room. and they will come out with significant changes and revisions in the form of a conference report. I have been having townhall meetings around my State of Arizona. the second hardesthit State in America because of the economic downturn. I assure my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. there is a revolution going on out there. It is a peaceful revolution. They do not want increased costs of a reform commitment that would be up to $3 trillion. that would cut Medicare by $500 billion and tax Americans across the entire income spectrum by an additional $500 billion. My friends across the aisle may not have gotten the message from the elections in New Jersey and Virginia not that long ago. Americans want cost control. and they want affordable and available health care. They dont want increases in taxes. They dont want the government taking over the health care system. Yet that is what is going to be delivered. A lot of people. may I say. may not trust the word of some of us on this side of the aisle and may think we are uninformed or we are just politicians. Maybe we ought to listen to Dr. Jeffrey Flier. dean of the Harvard Medical School. I have never been that great of an admirer of Harvard. but the dean of the Harvard Medical School states in todays Wall Street Journal. entitled ""Health Debate Deserves a Failing Grade""-and he has some criticism for this side of the aisle that perhaps is deservedAs the dean of the Harvard Medical School. I am frequently asked to comment on the healthreform debate. Id give it a failing grade. Instead of forthrightly dealing with the fundamental problems. discussion is dominated by rival factions struggling to enact or defeat President Barack Obamas agenda. The rhetoric on both sides is exaggerated and often deceptive. Those of us for whom the central issue is health not politicshave been left in the lurch. And as the controversy heads towards a conclusion in Washington. it appears that the people who favor the legislation are engaged in collective denial. Our healthcare system suffers from problems of cost. access and quality. and needs major reform. Tax policy drives employmentbased insurance. this begets overinsurance and drives costs upward while creating inequities for the unemployed and selfemployed. A regulatory morass limits innovation. And deep flaws in Medicare and Medicaid drive spending without optimizing care. During the last campaign. I proposed addressing the issue of employerprovided health benefits. doing away with it in return for a $5.000 refundable tax credit. Tens of millions of dollars in attack ads were leveled against it. I proposed it not because it was easy. not because I didnt think the American people didnt need straight talk. I did it because it is one of the fundamental problems with the cost of health care in America. If someone gets something for free. they are not going to be careful about the money that is spent. Ronald Reagan once said: Nobody ever washed a rental car. He is right. So when people receive free medical care that they dont have to pay for and that they dont have to have accountability for. it is obvious that that is misused. Again. there is the story this morning about some $49 billion in wasteful spending in Medicare. The numbers go on and on. Why is it that the dean of the Harvard Medical School says ""the rhetoric on both sides is exaggerated and often deceptive""? Maybe it is. But the rhetoric on both sides becomes more intense because of a failure to sit down and try to work something out together. At no time during this entire. long. drawnout process have there been serious negotiations between Republicans and Democrats. Not once. Of course. the rhetoric gets exaggerated on both sides and even deceptive. We are not doing what the American people expect us to do. and that is sit down together and work these things out on one of the greatest financial crises this Nation faces. Dr. Flier goes on to say: Speeches and news reports can lead you to believe that proposed congressional legislation would tackle the problems of cost. access and quality. But thats not true. The various bills do deal with access by expanding Medicaid and mandating subsidized insurance at substantial costand thus addresses an important social goal. However. there are no provisions to substantively control the growth of costs or raise the quality of care. So the overall effort will fail to qualify as reform. Dr. Flier is alleging that there is no control of the growth of costs or rise in the quality of care. We all know that the cost of health care is unsustainable. The Medicare trustees have said in 7 years it will go broke. I believe forcing more Americans into Medicaid. a public program that gets failing grades for access to care and the quality of care. is not the right approach to covering millions more Americans. Dean Flier goes on: In discussions with dozens of healthcare leaders and economists. I find near unanimity of opinion that. whatever its shape. the final legislation that will emerge from Congress will markedly accelerate national healthcare spending rather than restrain it. The whole problem with health care in America is not the quality of health care. it is the accessibility and affordability. Dr. Flier says ""the final legislation that will emerge will markedly accelerate national health care spending rather than restrain it."" Dr. Flier continues: Likewise. nearly all agree that the legislation would do little or nothing to improve quality or change healthcares dysfunctional delivery system. This isnt just Dr. Fliers opinion. Look at Samuelsons article the other day about the effects of what has been passed by the House and will apparently be before us. Democrats are proposing a $3 trillion expansion of government health care. including $1 trillion in Medicare cuts and tax increases. But experts tell us the legislation would do little or nothing to improve quality or change health cares dysfunctional delivery system. Senate committees have spent months writing bills and spinning the benefits of legislation. and experts tell us the efforts fail the basic test. On March 5 of this year. the President is quoted as saying: If people think we can simply take everybody whos not insured and load them up in a system where costs are out of control. it is not going to happen. We will run out of money. The federal government will be bankrupt. state governments will be bankrupt. The President is right. But the Democratic leadership writing these bills is not listening. Partisan reform designed behind closed doors will bankrupt this country. in effect committing generational theft. The majority leader continues to put his bill together in a secret committee of one with a deaf ear to what experts tell us is needed. And we wait. We wait with great anticipation to see how high taxes and fees will be increased. We wait with great anticipation to finally understand how Senate Democrats will force a government health insurance entitlement into our health care market. We will wait to see how much they will cut Medicare. And these are Medicare cuts. my friends. have no doubt about it. We will wait to see the new mandates on individuals and employers to buy governmentdesigned insurance. We already know that the Senate Finance Committee bill includes roughly $508 billion in new taxes on individuals and businesses. Beginning in January of 2010. health insurers would also be required to pay annual nondeductible fees totaling $60.4 billion over 10 years. Beginning in January of 2010. medical device manufacturers are required to pay $40 billion in new nondeductible fees. Beginning in January 2010. prescription drug manufacturers are required to pay $22 billion in new nondeductible fees. By the way. in case my colleagues missed it. surprise. surprise. the pharmaceutical industry has now dramatically increased their prices. while the cost of living has gone down. What a shocker. Those great people from the pharmaceutical lobby who have been willing to make such ""sacrifices"" for the American people are raising their prices in an unprecedented fashion. totally disconnected to the absolutely nonexistent increase in the cost of living. And the administration continues to oppose drug reimportation from Canada. where seniors could get prescription drugs for about half of what it is now costing them. Beginning in 2013. Democrats raise taxes by $201 billion by increasing taxes by 40 percent on certain family health care plans with higher coverage values. payable by insurance companies or employers. Beginning in 2013. taxpayers who deduct medical expenses on their tax returns will pay $15 billion more in taxes. Taxes on individuals who fail to maintain governmentapproved health insurance coverage will pay $4 billion in new penalties. breaking President Obamas promise that no one with income under $250.000 would pay higher taxes. Businesses that are struggling to keep the doors open and keep workers employed in this recession will see higher taxes of $23 billion in the form of mandates and penalties for failing to offer governmentapproved health insurance. Again. I urge my colleagues to read the article in the New York Post entitled ""Obamacare: Buy now. pay later"" by the wellrespected economist Robert Samuelson. He writes: There is an air of absurdity to what is mistakenly called ""healthcare reform."" Everyone knows that the United States faces massive governmental budget deficits as far as calculators can project. driven heavily by an aging population and uncontrolled health costs. As we recover slowly from a devastating recession. its widely agreed that. though deficits should not be cut abruptly (lest the economy resume its slump). a prudent society would embark on longterm policies to control health costs. reduce government spending and curb massive future deficits. The administration estimates these (deficits) at $9 trillion from 2010 to 2019. The president and all his top economic advisers proclaim the same cautionary message. So what do they do? Just the opposite. Their farreaching overhaul of the healthcare system which Congress is halfway toward enacting would almost certainly make matters worse. It would create new. openended medical entitlements that threaten higher deficits and would do little to suppress surging health costs. The disconnect between what President Obama says and what hes doing is so glaring that most people could not abide it. The president. his advisers and allies have no trouble. But reconciling blatantly contradictory objectives requires them to engage in willful selfdeception. public dishonesty. or both. Those are not my comments. Mr. President. Those are the comments of Robert Samuelson. one of the most respected economists in America. I want to take another minute to talk about how the influence of special interestsI mentioned the pharmaceutical companies and the deal they cut so the administration would oppose drug importation from Canada. that there would not be competition for Medicare patients. But let me talk about probably the most powerful force in this whole discussion of legislation. and that is the trial lawyers of America. There is no provision for medical liability or medical malpractice reform in this legislation. In fact. it was passed by the House that if States have enacted reforms. they will not be eligible for any additional funding to try and fund demonstration projects to reduce the cost of medical malpractice. Everybody knows. ask any physician. they will tell you. they practice defensive medicine. They do so because of their fear of finding themselves in court and being wiped out. Sometimes these additional procedures and tests are not so comfortable for the patient. but. most importantly. they dramatically increase costs. Time after time after time. any effort we have made to put in medical malpractice reformand we will do it again when the majority leader gives birth to whatever you want to call thisthen. the fact is. they are not seriously interested in reducing costs. but they are seriously dependent on the largesse and generosity of the trial lawyers of America. and it is an outrage. It is an absolute outrage. I would point out. when the President talks about. ""demonstration projects."" there is a demonstration. it is called Texas. The State of Texas was hemorrhaging doctors and physicians and medical care practitioners. They reformed the medical malpractice. There have now been reductions in premiums. There have been reductions in lawsuits. There have been doctors and physicians and medical care providers flowing back into the State of Texas. It is proven. It is not everything we want. But it shows that medical malpractice reform can reduce health care costs. And what have my friends on the other side and a couple on this side done? They have refused to consider in any significant way what everyone agrees could reduce health care costs in America. Outrageous. So do not be surprised when our approval rating is 18 percent. The approval rating of Congress: 18 percent. And in the townhall meetings I have been having. I have not met anybody in that 18 percent. We need truth and honesty in our national discussion on health care reform. not spin. not budget gimmicks. not cuts to Medicare. not higher taxes. not government takeover. and not trillions in new health care spending. We have $12 trillion in debt. 10 percent unemployment17 percent real unemployment in my Stateand an economy that is still struggling. Meanwhile. Wall Street makes obscene profits and bonuses that are unbelievable. We cannot afford another $3 trillion openended health entitlement. Americans deserve an honest discussion of ideas without artificial deadlines. and real solutions that will bring our skyrocketing health care costs under control. Finally. I guess we are told that maybe this evening there may be something that will emerge with white smoke from the majority leaders office and we will be given the manifesto that he will call health care reform. and that will begin a great debate. I believe the question will be: Will the special interests and the big spenders and those who are in favor of government control of health care in America win or will the American people win? That is why the American people are aroused. If they stay aroused. and if we continue to see the tea parties and the townhall meetings and the expressions of anger and frustration the American people feel. we will beat this back and we will go back to the bargaining tablefor the first time we will go to the bargaining table and sit down. Republicans and Democrats. together. History shows there has been no successful reform in America without bipartisanship. and I do not believe this will be the first one. I hopeI hope and prayit will not be. Mr. President.

1110021221,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of my bill to rename the Freedom Post Office honor of John Scott Challis. Jr. John Challis inspired all of us with his determination to live every single day to the fullest. On June 23. 2006. John was diagnosed with liver cancer. He was only 16 and had just completed sophomore year at Freedom High School. John and his family had a lot of questions after the cancer diagnosis: questions for the doctors about the disease. his treatment. and how it would impact his life. But. in these most difficult of circumstances. John found answers. In a Pittsburgh Post Gazette article from May 2008. Johns father. Scott Challis. recalls this time: ""Hes always been one who had to try and find an answer for everything. He wants to figure things out."" The article continues. ""Through his own thoughts and through his deep Catholic beliefs. John believes he has figured it out. When asked where he gained his wisdom. he answered. Through cancer."" Despite his illness. John made the most of every day he had. Although he was too ill to play sports. Freedom baseball coach Steve Wetzel invited John to join the tearm and became one of Johns closest friends. In battling cancer. John had come up with a message: ""Courage Plus Believe Equals Life."" It was a message that along with his name. he inscribed on the inside of his baseball cap. His teammates followed suit. Then came the moment John had been waiting for. his opportunity to play. Coach Wetzel asked John to pinchhit in a game against Aliquippa. John wasted no time. On the first pitch. John hit a single to right field that scored a run. After the game. Johns story and message garnered national attention. He was featured on ESPN. invited to speak at a Pirates game. and watched the Penguins in their Stanley Cup playoff run. Unfortunately. John lost this battle to cancer on August 19. 2008. But he left us with an important legacy. In his last few months. John was quoted as saying. ""Life aint about how many breaths you take. Its what you do with those breaths."" John was an inspiration to me. to his local community. and to the lives he touched. He Will always be remembered. However. even after his death. his inspiration and work continue. Last summer. John helped to start a foundation. the Courage for Life Foundation. to help other student athletes with lifethreatening illnesses be involved in sporting events. I have a few articles about Johns life and his impact on those he touched. I ask unanimous consent to enter them into the RECORD. Thank you.

1110020230,Thank you. Mr. Speaker. I rise today in strong support of this important resolution. and I want to thank my friend. Congressman RUSH HOLT. Speaker NANCY PELOSI. and the chairman and ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee for their leadership in the long struggle for freedom. dignity. and human rightsin Tibet. Mr. Speaker. for six decades the history of Tibet has been marked by violence. Even before 1949. the Peoples Liberation Army of China entered the eastern areas of Tibet during the Long March. In 1959. they finally occupied the capital of Lhasa. Fifty years ago. on March 10. the Tibetan people rose up in Lhasa against Chinese rule. The backlash was furious and brutal. On March 17. the Dalai Lama fled Lhasa for his own safety. joined by some 80.000 Tibetans. for life in exile. Tens of thousands who remained were kill or imprisoned. Thanks to the thriving exile communities in India. Europe. and the United States. Tibetan cultural identity. language. and religion have survived. They have focused world attention on the Tibetan struggle. But each and every year. the situation inside Tibet grows worse. with more repression. more arrests. more displacement. more deliberate destruction of the Tibetan language. culture. and religion. One year ago. new protests rose up in Tibet. They were the result of greater controls over religious alid cultural activity. development that mainly benefited Chinese migrants. and forced resettlement of farmers and nomads. Thousands and thousands were arrested. To date. there has been no full accounting by Chinese authorities of those arrested. detained. tried. sentenced. or released. and no access to those detained by the International Committee of the Red Cross or other international observers. and all the time the Tibetan people daily become more of a minority in their own land. Mr. Speaker. as the new cochair of the Tom 16antos Human Rights Commission. it is humbling to follow in the footsteps of Thomas Lantos. The Congressional Human Rights Caucus. which he founded. was the very first to give the Dalai Lama a voice on Capitol Hill in 1987. On this 50th anniversary. lets be very. very clear that the American people in this House stand with His Holiness. We will not rest until meaningful and full autonomy for the Tibetan people is achievedand the Dalai Lama and his people can fulfill their dream of returning home to Tibet. I thank the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee for generously giving me this time. Mr. Speaker. I rise today in strong support of this important resolution. which recognizes the plight of the Tibetan people on the 50th Anniversary of His Holiness the Dalai Lamas exile and calls for a sustained multilateral effort toward a peaceful solution to the Tibet issue. I thank my friend RUSH HOLT. and the distinguished Ranking Member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. as well the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. for their leadership on human rights and for bringing this resolution expeditiously to the floor. Mr. Speaker. last Friday my friend and distinguished colleague. FRANK WOLF and I were formally reappointed CoChairs of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission. the successor body of the. Congressional Human Rights Caucus. which I had the honor to cochair with FRANK WOLF after our former colleague Tom Lantos passed away. I mention this because of the historic significance of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus in getting the voice of the Tibetan people heard in the United States. In 1987. it was Congressman Tom Lantos who had invited His Holiness the Dalai Lama to attend a meeting of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus as the first official government entity in the United States. despite stiff opposition from many quarters including the U.S. Administration to do so. Many were fearful what such an invitation would do to our bilateral relations with the Peoples Republic of China. and the PRC used every conceivable tool to prevent this historic meeting from happening. Those voices of those critics in the United States soon fell quiet after the meeting took place. as the moral authority of his Holiness and his perstintly peaceful way to fight for meaningful autonomy of the Tibetan people attracted more and more support and with the American people and in Congress. Twenty years later. it was this body that awarded His Holiness the Congressional Gold Medal in recognition of his lifelong dedication to the causes of peace and nonviolent resolution to the Tibet issue. Mr. Speaker. .the history of Tibet has long been marked by violence. Even before 1949. the Peoples Liberation Army of China entered the eastern areas of the traditional Tibetan territory on The Long March. In 1951. they finally occupied the Tibetan capital of Lhasa. On this day fifty years ago. the Tibetan people rose up in Lhasa against Chinese rule. and the backlash was furious and brutal. As a consequence. His Holiness the Dalai Lama fled Lhasa on March 17. 1959. for his own safety. He was joined by some 80.000 Tibetans in exile. Tens of thousandsof Tibetans who remained were either killed or imprisoned. The human rights situation became so dire that in 1959. 1961 and 1965 (before China became a member of the United Nations). the UN General Assembly passed resolutions condemning the human rights violations in Tibet and affirming Tibetans right to selfdetermination. Supported by thriving exile communities in India. the United States. Europe. Tibetan cultural identity. language and religion has survived and the world is paying attention to the Tibetan struggle. In 2002 Congress passed the Tibetan Policy Act. the cornerstone of U.S. policy toward Tibet. The legislation codified the position of Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues In our State Department. to ensure that U.S. policy promotes a didlogue between the Chinese government and the representatives of the Dalai Lama. and this Act and its policies must remain the cornerstone of our policy regarding Tibet also under this Administration. The policy of the United States Government has to be to continue promoting substantive dialogue between the Government of the Peoples Republic of China and the Dalai Lama or his representatives to resolve peacefully the dispute and to allow for the return of the Dalai Lama. However. the United States cannot stand as a mere neutral facilitator in this dialogue. when the Chinese govemment time and time again uses these proceedings to hold out hope. only to drag out negotiations with His Holiness without ever making any progress or without ever achieving any concrete results. All this. while the Tibetan people become a minority in their own territory because of governmentcontrolled migration. and the Tibetan culture is further eroded. We cannot stand by neutrally. when the Chinese government kidnaps a sixyearold child. Gedhun Choekyi Nyima. whom His Holiness has recognized as Panchen Lama. and allow the Chinese government to replace him with a more convenient Panchem Lama of their own choice. On this 50th anniversary. lets be very clear that the American people and this Congress will always stand unwaveringly with His Holiness in this peaceful endeavors. and will not rest until meaningful and full autonomy for the Tibetan people is achieved. and His Holiness can fulfill his dream of returning to Tibet. Mr. Speaker. Tom Lantos voice has fallen silent. but we cannot let our voices to fall silent too. We always need to speak out for the Tibetan people. [From the Boston Globe.

1110000067,The gentleman from Wisconsin said. why will the majority not in some instances agree with the minority? Thats the problem. We are talking about cases where we in the majority have tried to agree with the minority. and they would not be agreed with. They would not take yes for an answer. This is the issue: if they offer a motion to recommit and it says forthwith. and they win the vote. the bill is amended. If they offer an amendment to a bill. not having offered it in committee. not having gone to the Rules Committee to ask it to be on the floor. if they take a noncontroversial popular issue and offer it as the motion to recommit. but say it should be sent to the committee and reported back promptly. we have tried to agree with them. and they have refused. This literally is a way to not take yes for an answer. its a way to take something to which the -majority would like to agree. I have been here when I. and when the majority leader has said. in such a situation. could we get unanimous consent to simply agree to that now. and the minority has said no. Well. people have a right not to be agreed with. People have a right not to be agreeable. Some indulge that right more than others. But you dont have a right to refuse to be agreed with. and then complain that you werent agreed with. And thats all thats at stake here. So. yes. there are times when the majority should say yes to the minority. and that should be determined by the floor. What were saying is the minority should not manufacture a situation in which there is no way to say yes to them because their goal is patently not to amend that particular bill. because if it was. they would accept the request that that amendment be accepted. Instead. it is to put a bill back to committee because theyre afraid to vote against it. Thats the issue. This is used as a way to send bills back to committee to avoid votes.

1110049452,If the -gentleman would yield. I appreciate very much your raising the issue of health information technology. Youre absolutely right. The health industry has been so slow to really be involvedto really use the computer. to use information technologyin a way that so many other industries have been. As any of us know who started out in our professional careers not using computers. I think we sometimes were slow or were anxious to do it. We were nervous about that. I remember someone who worked for me a number of years ago who resisted it completely. She said: Dont be silly. I know exactly what Im doing. I take notes. I do fine. We finally told her she had to use a computer. We just told her that we were doing it. Just a few months later. I remember the computer system went down. and she was like: Oh. my goodness: How can I function? Well. you can imagine this in health care. which has been so paperdriven and so laborintensive. the idea that physicians would have this at their fingertips even within their own city or even within their own medical practice sometimes. I was talking with a medical practitioner who said: SometimesI dont knowa patient could have been in my office. seeing another doctor the day before. and because the notes werent transcribed yet. I dont know happened--or 3 days ago. Another example: A patient who is just visiting Geisinger health system in Pennsylvaniaa great model. The primary care physician has the ability to see the hospital records while patients are in the hospital. So they dont have to wait 3 weeks for specialists who saw them in the hospital to write them a summary. have it dictated and mailed to the primary care physician 3 weeks later or 4 weeks later. It turns out those 3 or 4 weeks are incredibly important. after discharge. for the patient to be following the advice of the physician and knowing what to do. Its a very uncertain time. You need to be able to have contact with your primary care physician during that time. and the primary care physician needs to know firsthand what happened to you. An electronic medical record is extremely important in helping a primary care physician provide the right care for you and prevent a readmis-. sion. which is a huge cost for all of us. Weve talked a lot about that in terms of infections. but there are a lot of reasons people get readmitted to the hospital. If we can prevent that by the right kind of home care. as you pointed out. or by the right care and attention from a primary care physician. that is not only going to help that person stay healthier. but it is also going to help that person get the care he wants. I know we talked about this. too. which is. in terms of improving quality. there are now critical protocols. We like to think that every one of our physicians knows exactly what to do for us. By and large. most of our physicians. fortunately. are pretty good. As for all of us. if you have to do five things for somebody when one comes to you because one has some particular health condition and you tend to do four of those five most of the time. youre probably pretty good. It turns out. if you actually do all five every time. your patients are going. to be a whole lot better off for it. So. you know. maybe were not used to the -fact that the doctor might actualy look that up on the electronic medical record and have to check it off. but it turns out that it really makes a big difference when you really did remember to remind one to stop smoking and when you really did -remember to tell a parent to put a child in a seatbelt. I mean all of those things may not seem so directly connected to what a physician was seeing one for. but it enables the physician to make sure one gets the care one needs: Remind them about mammograms. Its time. If a woman hasnt had a mammogram for 3 or 4 years. maybe its time. not to mention making sure that they take the right medications and follow the right orders.  So electronic medical records are whatyoure rightthe new Dems have really championed. and we have. of course. a President who has championed it as well. We put in $19 billion in the Recovery and Reinvestment Act to really help push this forward in a much more ambitious waythe use of electronic medical records in our physicians offices and in our hospitals and having them be secure. private and interoperable. Its absolutely key.

1110003045,Madam Speaker. I am glad I was here on the floor to respond to the prior Member who felt compelled to say that he thought the Wall Street bailout was working. I would like to know what evidence he has to prove that. since we have no forensic accounting of what the Wall Street banks that got all this money did with the money. Maybe he has some special access inside these institutions and can provide it to the RECORD. because I will tell you what happened yesterday. I went before our Rules Committee and I proposed a very simple amendment. My amendment was that before we give one more dime of the peoples money. we require the Treasury to do a forensic accounting of every bit of money that was sent up there to Wall Street. And I was denied my amendment. There is no Member of this Congress that can say with accuracy. including the gentleman who just spoke. that he knows where the money is. because. you know what? They havent told us. All you know is what you have read in the newspapers. and how can we extend more money from the American people when we dont even know what happened to the money that went out the door? So you can say whatever you want and create a fiction. but the fact is that foreclosures are going up across this country. That bill that was passed last year was supposed to help people hang onto their homes. In Ohio. foreclosures have gotten worse every month. What I am telling people right now is. stay in your homes. If the American people. anybody out there is being foreclosed. dont leave. because I will tell you what. If you had a smart lawyer like those banks up there on Wall. Street can get. they would take you into court and they couldnt find the mortgage. They couldnt find the mortgage. So why should any American citizen be kicked out of their hores in this cold weather? In Ohio it is going to be 10 or 20 below zero. Dont leave your home. Because you know what? When those companies say they have your mortgage. unless you have a lawyer that can put his or her finger on that mortgage. you dont have that mortgage. and you are going to find they cant find the paper up there on Wall Street. So I say to the American people. you be squatters in your own homes. Dont you leave. In Ohio and Michigan and Indiana and Illinois and all these other places our people are being treated like chattel. and this Congress is stymied. We have the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression and our committees are muzzled. Power is given to one chairman or one person. We are all equal here. We have a right to be heard. The concerns of our constituents have a right to be registered in the committees of this House. not choked down as what is happening here today. It is just a tragedy. And if we dont fix the economic cure. it is going to get worse. and the cure is to go after the home foreclosure crisis. Who does that? Treasury? No. That is absolutely the wrong place. We need the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Securities and Exchange Commission empowered to do the real estate workouts on books across this country. Those are the normal institutions that are used. And then you have got HUD there now with FHA that can take these mortgages once they are refinanced. But that is not what is happening across our country. There is no help for the homeowner. That whole section they talked about today. Help for Homeowners over at HUD. nobody has even benefited. We said last year they wouldnt. and that is exactly what has happened. So I say to the American people. stay in your homes. You have earned them. And dont you get out until you get a really good lawyer who can find your mortgage up there on Wall Street. Because. you know what?

1110059136,I thank my friend. Mr. HALL. from Texas for yielding me more time. Mr. Chairman. this legislation has support from both sides of the aisle. but as was made perfectly clear in our committee markup back in July. there are some serious concerns with the amount of money being authorized and where exactly it will go. In recent bills. such as the Wall Street bailout and the stimulus bill from earlier this year. we have provided a lack of appropriate oversight for the money being spent. I do not want to see us make the same mistake with this legislation. Most of us can agree that developing alternative fuel cell technology is a necessary precursor to taking control of our energy consumption needs. and all of us on both sides of the aisle have that philosophy and believe in that. but simply throwing money at a problem is never a solution. and my amendment is just a good. commonsense improvement. however minor. to this otherwise very noble legislation.

1110027191,That would be an even nicer touch. The one thing I would say that was left out was when there was a new administration and a complete change in direction in 2001. I did offer a complete alternative. My colleague is very un.happy with the Presidents budget. This is their opportunity. if they are as unhappy as they say. to offer an alternative. But they dont have one. They dont have an alternative. They dont have an alternative budget. They dont have an alternative vision. All they want to do is say no. They want to say no to the Presidents budget. They want to say no to the budget that has come from the Budget Committee. They say no to their even offering an alternative. When the situation was reversed. a new President in 2001. with a radically different vision. we offered a full alternative. I am proud we did. When I hear the other side talk about the growth of debt. I have to ask. where were they the last 8 years? Where were they? Where were they when the previous administration doubled the debt of the country? In fact. they more than doubled it. Where were they when the previous administration tripled foreign holdings of U.S. debt? As this chart shows. it took 224 years and 42 Presidents to run up $1 trillion of U.S. debt held abroad. and the previous President ran that up by more than $2 trillion. He tripled the amount of U.S. debt held abroad. We have become increasingly dependent on the kindness of strangers. Last year. under their administration. 68 percent of the new debt of this country was financed by foreign entities. *Where were they when that was happening? This President inherits the colossal mess left behind by the previous ad-. ministration. a debt that had more than doubled. foreign holdings of U.S. debt more than tripled. and the worst economic slowdown since the Great Depression. This President has been in office 3 months. Under the terms of the amendment they are now offering. they act as though he is responsible for debt runup during the previous administration. Please. That has zero credibility. They are saying that debt runup in the last quarter of the last administration is attributed to this administration. They say the budget that this President is inheriting for this year is the responsibility of this President. I dont think so. That is not the way I ever did the calculations. When their administration was in power. Ialways held their administration harmless for the first year since they were inheriting the budget of the previous administration and the economics of the previous administration. Now they want to try to stick President Obama with the failures of the last administration and say debt runup in the previous administration is his debt. I dont think so. That is not fair. That is not going to sell. Here is what happened when they were in charge. We now have China as the No. 1 financier of U.S. debt. We owe them $740 billion. Japan is not far behind. We owe them $635 billion. Where were they when this debt was being run up? I will tell you where they were. They were in full lockstep support of the previous administration. They voted for every dollar of the debt that was run up. One place I will agree with them is that it is dangerous to have run up that debt. Unfortunately. with this economic slowdown. we are going to have a lot more debt. a lot more deficAts. until we are able to lift out of this and then pivot and get back to a more sustainable course. China is worried about the U.S. debt.. They were worried about it before this administration. they were worried about it in the previous administration. and well they should be. If we look at any analysis of the debt we have from 2001 to 2014. who is responsible for the debt buildup? This red bar is what the Bush administration will have been responsible for. The green is the recession and interest on inherited debt. The contribution of this budget is the small yellow piece because we have the Titanic of debt coming at us. It is a result of the policies inherited by this administration. the result of the economic collapse inherited by this administration. That is the reason we have the circumstance we face today. Let me quote Senator GREGG. He was kind enough to quote me. I would like to quote him. This is what he said on March 11. He was quoting me from 2006. I stand by those quotes. This is March 11. Senator GREGG: Im willing to accept this [shortterm debt deficit] number and not debate it. because we are in a recession. and its necessary for the government to step in and be aggressive. and the government is the last source of liquidity. And so you can argue that this number. although horribly large. is something we have to live with. He was right on March 11by the way. my daughters birthday. and the day before my birthday. Usually he gives me a gift on my birthday. No gift this year. I am very hurt by this. I dont know why Senator GREGG absolutely forgot my birthday. He remembers my quotes. but no remembrance of my birthday. That is OK. I still like him very much. He is a very nice person. But the place where he and I absolutely agree is the second 5 years. We have to do a lot more to get the debt under control under the Presidents budget. even my budget. -which dramatically reduces the deficit and debt. The truth is. we have to do more. It is in the countrys interest that we do. Lets talk a minute about what we are accomplishing in the budget before us. We are dramatically reducing the deficit. from $1.7 trillion this year. an alltime record. because of the dramatic economic slowdown. That means less revenue. more expenditure. exploding deficit. and. $1.3 trillion of this $1.7 trillion is exclusively .the responsibility of the previous President. A new President walks into a situation. He didnt construct the conditions for this year. That is the previous administration. So $1.3 trillion of this .years deficit reflects the policies of the previous administration. We hold President Obama responsible for $400 billion of the deficit this year because that is the effect of his stimulus package and other legislation that passed. So. yes. he has a responsibility for some of this deficit this year. but it is about onefourth of what we will experience this year. Then we are dramatically reducing the deficit by $500 billion for the next year. The next year we bring it down another $300 billion. the next year another $300 billion. and. by 2014. we take it down to $508 billion. a more than twothirds reduction in the 5 years of this budget as a share of gross domestic prodict. which is what economists say ought to be the comparison. Why do they say it? Because if you look at it in dollar terms. that does not take account of inflation. If you do it as a share of gross domestic product. that takes account of inflation. You can see we are even more dramatically reducing the deficit under that metric. from 12.2 percent of gross domestic product today down to less than 3 percent in the fifth year. which economists all say is what we need to do to stabilize the growth of the debt. We need to get to 3 percent of GDP or less. We do that in the fifth year and bring down the deficit as a share of GDP each and every year of the 5 years of the budget. My colleagues on the other side have offered an amendment that saysand I hope colleagues are listening because we are going to vote on this. and we will be voting pretty soon on this proposalif the debt is at a certain level. it will require 60 votes to write a budget resolution. Lets think about that. Lets think of the implications of what they are offering. They say. if the debt is not below a certain level. you cannot write a budget resolution unless you get a supermajority vote. Do we want to do that? I would say to my colleagues. the budget resolution is the vehicle that has all the budget disciplines in it. all the supermajority points of order against spending. and they would jeopardize those very disciplines that can heli us hold down deficits and debt. What sense does that make? I ask my colleagues. does it make any sense at all to be saying we are going to make it harder to write a budget resolution that provides the disciplines to hold down spending. that provides all those supermajority points of order against additional spending? I say to my colleagues. the cure -they are offering is worse than the disease. Please. colleagues. lets not go with that idea. I will tell you. in the committee. they actually offeredwhich I thought was the most bizarre. and I have been on the Budget Committee 22 yearsin the committee they actually offered a proposal to tie our standards on deficits and debt to Europe. So we are going to adopt the European Union model under the amendment they offered in the committee. Could you imagine? Now the question of what our fiscal policy should be would be tied to France. would be tied to Italy. would be tied to Spain. would be tied to Germany. would be tied to Belgium. This is America. This is an American budget for the American people. We ought not to be tying ourselves to the French. the Italians. I love the Italians. My wife is Italian. But. my goodness. they are talking about tying our budget standards to the European Union? I do not think so. I say to my colleagues. this amendment they are offeringwell intended. absolutely well intended. I do not question their motivation at all. but I do question very much the specifics of the proposal they have offered. Mr. President.

1110051238,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself 3 minutes. Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of my amendment. which I offer with Representatives MIKE MICHAUD and CAROLYN MALONEY. The amendment increases by $5 million the funding for the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program and offsets that by a corresponding decrease in general operating expenses in the Office of Justice. Unlike- eyewitness testimony and other circumstantial evidence. DNA evidence provides scientific accuracy and assurance. It has resulted in the conviction of countless perpetrators of violent crimes and has freed hundreds of innocent people. -It is incredible that we can identify the guilty and exclude the innocent with certainty with just a little biological evidence and a scientific -test: The problem. of course. is that you actually have to collect that biological evidence. do that test. and record that information. If you do not. the power of DNA evidence is unrealized. Unfortunately. there is a backlog in the hundreds of thousands in the analysis of DNA evidence. This backlog includes untested samples from convicted offenders and from crime scenes. including rape kits. When such a powerful tool as DNA evidence is unused. we must act. For years I have worked to reduce the DNA backlog and helped pass legislation to do just that. The Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program provides grants to States to collect DNA samples from offenders and crime scenes. including rape kits. to analyze those samples and to expand DNA laboratory capacity. That money is making a difference. and we must ensure that it continues to be available. Congress provided $151 million to the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program forfiscal year 2009 and reauthorized the program at this level through fiscal year 2014. Unfortunately. this bill cuts this by $5 million for the coming fiscal year to $146 million and my amendment would restore it to 151. While I understand the budgetary constraints faced by the Appropriations Committee.- this program must H6f18 not be reduced when these grants mean protecting the lives of millions of innocent Americans and reducing the number of sexual assaults and rapes.

1110008308,"Mr. President. I would like to begin by thanking the managers for their patience and their leadership in this marathon that we are engaged. I rise in support of the Coburn amendment. which strikes the $246 million Hollywood tax earmark. It is quite an interesting. earmark in that the stimulus legislation provides a tax earmark for Hollywood in the amount of $246 milliona quarter of a billion dollarsover the next 11 years. and would allow large Hollywood studios the opportunity to choose between the existing tax break for movie studios or to write off 50 percent of the entire production cost for movies and TV shows made in 2009. In the years that follow the remainder of the production cost would be written off according to existing depreciation law. The 50percent accelerated depreciation in the first year is a ""bonus depreciation."" Obviously. this amendment would strike that special earmark. I would point out to my colleagues that Hollywood is doing okay. They raked in over a billion dollars in Januarythe biggest January ever for the movie industry. That is testimony to the attractiveness of the product.

DC. and claimed: We are a special interest group that doesnt ask for anything like earmark legislation or tax breaks. We are the one industry that doesnt ask for a quid pro quo. Well. rather than targeting tax breaks at bigtime political donors. the stimulus should have targeted its tax break toward mainstream America. I regret that I cant support the socalled stimulus bill that has been presented. We have an opportunity to craft a bill that would provide real relief for the American people at a time of great economic uncertainty. Unfortunately. that opportunity has so far been rejected. Once again. parochial partisan and special interests have taken precedence over the interests of the American people. This bill has become nothing more than a massive spending bill. expected to cost taxpayers more than $1.2 trillion. according to the latest estimate by the Congressional Budget Office. and $1.2 trillion dwarfs any Government program in history. after adjusting for inflation. It is bigger than the New Deal and the Iraq war combined. The interest alone will be costlier than the Louisiana Purchase in current dollars or the amount the United States spent to land on the Moon. During a press conference in November 2008 to introduce the new Director of the Office of Management and Budget. then Presidentelect Obama said: The new way of doing business is. lets figure out what projects. what investments are going to give the American economy the most bang for their buck. how we protect taxpayer dollars so that this money is not wasted. restore a sense of confidence among taxpayers that. when we spend our money. it is on that which is actually going to improve their quality of life. create jobs that are so desperately needed. help to spur on economic growth and business creation in the private sector. That is all part of the new way of doing business. 1I was very pleased to hear the President speak those words. However. I do not believe the bill before us today is reflective of that sentiment. Lets acknowledge and continue to acknowledge that American families are hurting and they need our help. We have entered the second year of a recession. RECORD numbers of homeowners face foreclosure. our financial markets have nearly collapsed. the U.S. automobile manufacturers are in serious trouble. and the national unemployment rate stands at 7.2 percent--the highest in 16 yearswith over 1.9 million people having lost their jobs in the last 4 months of 2008. Additionally. the number of Americans filing firsttime unemployment claims this month matches the highest level in 26 years. Housing starts decreased 15.5 percent in December compared to the prior month. For 2008. housing starts were at a new low. shattering the previous record of 1.014 million set in 1991. The list goes on and on. and I dont have to tell any American of the economic challenges we face and the real suffering that is going on throughout America. In the last year alone. due to the mortgage crisis. the Government has seized control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. and we already passed a massive $700 billion rescue of the financial markets. We have debated giving the big three auto manufacturers tens of billions in taxpayer money as a ""shortterm infusion of cash."" knowing they would be back for more. Last week. the House approved its $819 billion stimulus package on a partyline vote. The total cost of that legislation is almost as much as the annual discretionary budget for the entire Federal Government. We need to stimulate the economy. but we need to do it in a smart. fiscally responsible manner that will not bankrupt future generations of. Americans. It is more important now than ever before that Congress restore fiscal discipline to Washington and get our financial house in order. In a November 25. 2008. opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal. John Taylor. a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and a professor of economics at Stanford University. wrote: The major part of the first stimulus package last year was the $115 billion temporary rebate payment program targeted to individuals and families that phased out as incomes rose. Most of the rebate checks were mailed or directly deposited durinj May. June. and July of 2008. The argument in favor of these temporary rebate payments was that they would increase consumption. stimulate aggregate demand. and thereby get the economy growing again. What were the results? This chart reveals the answer. The upper line shows disposable personal income through September. Disposable personal income is what households have left after paying taxes and receiving transfers from the government. The big blip is due to the rebate payments in May through July. The lower line shows personal consumption expenditures by households. Observe that consumption shows no noticeable increase at the time of the rebate. Hence. by this simple measure. the rebate did little or nothing to stimulate consumption. overall aggregate demand or the economy. These results may seem surprising. but they are not. They correspond closely to what basic economic theory tells us. Temporary increases in income will not lead to significant increases in consumption. However. if increases are longer term. as in the case of a permanent tax cut. then consumption is increased and by a significant amount. Mr. President.

1110000324,"Mr. President. I offer today private relief legislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Shigeru Yamada. a 24yearold Japanese national who lives in Chula Vista. California. The House passed a private relief bill on behalf of Mr. Yamada last year. but unfortunately we were unable to move the bill in the Senate before the end of the 110th Congress. I have decided to reintroduce a private bill on his behalf because I believe that Mr. Yainada represents a model American citizen. for whom removal from this country would represent an unfair hardship. Without this legislation. Mr. Yamada will be forced to return to a country in which he lacks any linguistic. cultural or family ties. Mr. Yamada legally entered the United States with his mother and two sisters in 1992 at the young age of 10. The family was fleeing from Mr. Yamadas alcoholic father. who had been physically abusive to his mother. the children and even his own parents. Since then. he has had no contact with his father and is unsure if he is even alive. Tragically. Mr. Yamada experienced further hardship when his mother was killed in a car crash in 1995. Orphaned at the age of 13. Mr. Yamada spent time living with his aunt before moving to Chula Vista to live with a close friend of his late mother. The death of his mother marked more than a personal tragedy for Mr. Yamada. it also served to impede the process for him to legalize his status. At the time of her death. Mr. Yamadas family was living legally in the United States. His mother had acquired a student visa for herself and her children qualified as her dependants. Her death revoked his legal status in the United States. In addition. Mr. Yamadas mother was engaged to an American citizen at the time of her death. Had she survived. her son would likely have become an American citizen through this marriage. Mr. Yamada has exhausted all administrative options under our current immigration system. Throughout high school. he contacted attorneys in the hopes of legalizing his status. but his attempts were unsuccessful. Unfortunately. time has run out and. for Mr. Yamada. the only option available to him today is private relief legislation. For several reasons. it would be tragic for Mr. Yamada to be deported from the United States and forced to return to Japan. First. since arriving in the United States. Mr. Yamada has lived as a model American. He graduated with honors from Eastlake High School in 2000. where he excelled in both academics and athletics. Academically. he earned a number of awards including being named an ""Outstanding English Student"" his freshman year. an AllAmerican Scholar. and earning the United States National Minority Leadership Award. His teacher and coach. Mr. John describes him as being ""responsible. hard working. organized. honest. caring and very dependable."" His role as the vice president of the Associated Student Body his senior year is an indication of Mr. Yamadas high level of leadership. as well as. his popularity and trustworthiness among his peers. As an athlete. Mr. Yamada was named the ""Most Inspirational Player of the Year"" in junior varsity baseball and football. as well as. varsity football. His football coach. Mr. Jose Mendoza. expressed his admiration by saying that he has ""seen in Shigeru Yamada the responsibility. dedication and loyalty that the average American holds to be virtuous."" Second. Mr. Yamada has distinguished himself as a local volunteer. As a member of the Eastlake High School Link Crew. he helped freshman find their way around campus. offered tutoring and mentoring services. and set an example of how to be a successful member of the student body. After graduating from high school. he volunteered.his time for 4 years as the coach of the Eastlake High School Girls softball team. The former head coach. who has since retired. Dr. Charles Sorge. describes him as an individual full of ""integrity"" who understands that as a coach it is important to work as a ""team player."" His level of commitment to the team was further illustrated to Dr. Sorge when he discovered. halfway through the season. that Mr. Yamadas commute to and from practice was 2 hours long each way. It takes an individual with character to volunteer his time to coach and never bring up the issue of how long his commute takes him each day. Dr. Sorge hopes that. once Mr. Yamada legalizes his immigration status. he will be formally hired to continue coaching. the team. Third. sending Mr. Yamada back to Japan would be an immense hardship for him and his family here. Mr. Yamada does not speak Japanese. He is unaware of the nations current cultural trends. And. he has no immediate family members that he knows of in Japan. All of his family lives in California. Sendfng Mr. Yamada back to Japan would serve to split his family apart and separate him from everyone and everything that he knows. His sister contends that her younger brother would be ""lost"" if he had to return to live in Japan on his own. It is unlikely that he would be able to find any gainful employment in Japan due to his inability to speak or read the language. As a member of the Chula Vista community. Mr. Yamada has distinguished himself as an honorable individial. His teacher. Mr. Robert Hughes. describes him as being an upstanding AllAmerican young man"". Until being picked up during a routine check of riders immigration status on a city bus. he had never been arrested or convicted of any crime. Mr. Yamada is not. and has never been. a burden on the State. He has never received any Federal or State assistance. With his hard work and givingattitude. Shigeru Yamada represents the ideal American citizen. Although born in Japan. he is truly American in every other sense. Given these extraordinary and unique facts. I ask my colleagues to support this private relief bill on behalf of Mr. Yamada. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.",111118161,FEINSTEIN,DIANNE,S,CA,F,D,,voting,2009-01-06,324,Mrs. FEINSTEIN,32232,32416,01062009.txt,5978,1021,111,2009,mr presid offer today privat relief legisl provid law perman resid statu shigeru yamada yearold japanes nation live chula vista california hous pass privat relief bill behalf mr yamada last year unfortun unabl move bill senat end th congress decid reintroduc privat bill behalf believ mr repres model american citizen remov countri would repres unfair hardship without legisl mr yamada forc return countri lack linguist cultur famili tie mr yamada legal enter unit state mother two sister young age famili flee mr yamada alcohol father physic abus mother children even parent sinc contact father unsur even aliv tragic mr yamada experienc hardship mother kill car crash orphan age mr yamada spent time live aunt move chula vista live close friend late mother death mother mark person tragedi mr yamada also serv imped process legal statu time death mr yamada famili live legal unit state mother acquir student visa children qualifi depend death revok legal statu unit state addit mr yamada mother engag american citizen time death surviv son would like becom american citizen marriag mr yamada exhaust administr option current immigr system throughout high school contact attorney hope legal statu attempt unsuccess unfortun time run mr yamada option avail today privat relief legisl sever reason would tragic mr yamada deport unit state forc return japan first sinc arriv unit state mr yamada live model american graduat honor eastlak high school excel academ athlet academ earn number award includ name outstand english student freshman year allamerican scholar earn unit state nation minor leadership award teacher coach mr john describ respons hard work organ honest care depend role vice presid associ student bodi senior year indic mr yamada high level leadership well popular trustworthi among peer athlet mr yamada name inspir player year junior varsiti basebal footbal well varsiti footbal footbal coach mr jose mendoza express admir say seen shigeru yamada respons dedic loyalti averag american hold virtuou second mr yamada distinguish local volunt member eastlak high school link crew help freshman find way around campu offer tutor mentor servic set exampl success member student bodi graduat high school time year coach eastlak high school girl softbal team former head coach sinc retir dr charl describ individu full integr understand coach import work team player level commit team illustr dr discov halfway season mr yamada commut practic hour long way take individu charact volunt time coach never bring issu long commut take day dr hope mr yamada legal immigr statu formal hire continu coach team third send mr yamada back japan would immens hardship famili mr yamada speak japanes unawar nation current cultur trend immedi famili member know japan famili live california mr yamada back japan would serv split famili apart separ everyon everyth know sister contend younger brother would lost return live japan unlik would abl find gain employ japan due inabl speak read languag member chula vista commun mr yamada distinguish honor teacher mr robert hugh describ upstand allamerican young man pick routin check rider immigr statu citi bu never arrest convict crime mr yamada never burden state never receiv feder state assist hard work shigeru yamada repres ideal american citizen although born japan truli american everi sens given extraordinari uniqu fact ask colleagu support privat relief bill behalf mr yamada mr presid ask unanim consent text bill print record,558,FALSE
1110017281,Mr. President. this amendment is a very straightforward amendment. This Senate made a commitment last year through the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act -that we would fund in this bill money to be applied to the Justice Department to start and bring up to a level that is appropriate the funding of the investigative. prosecutorial. and other necessary agencies with which to go after these unsolved crimes. The reason it is important is that in most of these crimes. the witnesses are very elderly. So the timeliness of it is very important. It is interesting today that the other side produced a letter from the Attorney General that states exactly the opposite position they took last year when I opposed trying to get the money to pay for this bill. They bring forth a letter that says Attorney General Holder is going to make sure we -try to do this within the funds he has. That is the very argument I made last year. but it was not good enough. So we had hundreds of press releases go out on all these things we are going to do on the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act. Yet when it comes time to fund it this year. we cannot find $10 million in a $410 billion bill to do it. Either we mean to do it and we mean to uphold the promise we made to this group that has worked hard to have that bill passed or we are full of hot air. This amendment takes $10 million from a program that has questionable results in half of its grant money. I will not go into the details of it. Yet we will not fund this bill. I said last year on the Senate floor. we will see if you fund it. And sure enough. you didnt fund it. So you didnt keep your commitment. you didnt keep your commitment to Alvin Sykes. a guy who has worked 10 years to get that bill passed. And now we come up .nd say we will take care of it through the administration. which was the very argument I used that said we didnt need increased authorization. Now all of a sudden you say that is good enough. Well. it is not good enough. It breaks your commitment to fully fund this program to bring to justice those who committed these terrible crimes.

1110021127,The Senator from Tennessee can close after I finish my point. The point is. this is not the purpose of tax policy. The purpose of tax policy should be to raise the amount of money we need. and need legitimately. to run the Federal Government. and do so as fairly as possible. As they point out here. while the top 1 percent of earners in our country has earned 22 percent of the income. they pay 40 percent of the Federal taxes. The people who would get the brunt of the taxthose making above $200.000pay 60 percent of the Federal income taxes in America. One wonders why a group that pays 60 percent of the taxes already and only comprises 2 percent of our population is being unfairly treated. As a result of the Bush tax policy. they are actually paying a higher percentage of income taxes than they did before the Bush tax cuts went into effect.

1110023993,I thank the gentleman from Georgia. not only for your leadership in health care but for your time here. You know. we have many times discussed the issues involved in health care. and although I hear many people talk about the issue of accessible and affordable quality health care. very often the solution offered in this body by government is more government. and that is health care is expensive. so lets have someone pay for itthe government. Along those lines. Medicare and Medicaid oftentimes list it as. because so much is spent thereand I think Medicaid is $350 billion a year there. Between Medicare. Medicaid and the VA. almost half of the Federal mandatory budget is spent. The question is: Are they effective? Are they efficient? Does it have qualitybasedhealth care? I want to bring up just a couple issues here and emphasize the importance of that doctorpatient relationship. I am a psychologist. For many years. I have worked for hospitals in the Pittsburgh region in the pediatric. maternity and general medicine settings. but I have always had a strong relationship in working with a wide range of physicians and with other health care specialists. recognizing it is a team and in letting the team do their work that you really end up with some significant savings in quality of care. Let me talk about a couple of ways that that does occur. A recent report sent out by the New England Health Care Institute noted that the U.S. really spends more on health care than any other nation on Earth. and many times people talk about the negatives of our health care system in terms of higher rates. for example. of infant mortality. but there are concerns about how that data is reached. I will not go into that now. What I do want to point out. however. is that out of this $2.3 trillion health care system. which is very expensive and gets in the way of a lot of families affording health care. one of the deep concerns. perhaps. is that 30 to 40 percent of those health care dollars are wasted. $600 billion to $700 billion is what is listed in this report. Let me name a couple of things that go into this. If we let the doctorpatient relationship take supremacy over this and let physicians make decisions for what patients need. there are some changes we might see. First of all. unexplained variations in the intensity of medical and surgical procedures. including but not limited to endoflife care. the overuse of coronary artery bypass surgery and the overuse of percutaneous coronary procedures has the potential of avoidable costs of $600 billion. The misuse of drugs. overprescribing and underprescribing: some $52 billion. The overuse of nonurgent Emergency Department care: the savings could be $21 billion. The overuse of generic antihypertensive*: a potential savings of $3 billion. The list goes on. Now the question is: Why would these conditions exist? Well. actually. government. itself. stands in the way in many cases. and sometimes. well. it is the way health insurance is set up. but if the issue were instead that physicians could be the ones who are moving forward in this. I believe a lot of savings could take place. I believe what we should be doing as a legislative body is finding ways to break down those barriers and really helping to improve. One of the points to be made by a number of the doctors here on the floor tonight is about having more physicians involved. Lets take one of those aspects. Having a health care home is important. and one of the health care homes for people in some areas has to do with having a community health center. Now. community health centers provide great quality of care with a wide range of medical services. as my colleagues note. Yet there is a shortage of physicians. in part. because it is not the best paying position in the world. but many physicians want to help. The strange thing about this is that. in a wide range of health care areas. if you work at a community health center. your medical malpractice insurance is paid. If you volunteer. you are on your own. and so these clinics say. We cannot possibly afford that. There are different kinds of malpractice insurance that is not important to get into at this point. We have tried a number of times to allow it so physicians could actually volunteerso psychologists could volunteer. so dentists. podiatrists. social workers. and nurse practitionersbut no. the government says. We cannot let you do that. There are also areas. too. that come up here in terms of how we could let disease management work. Here is one of the strangest things that happens with Medicaid: You know. one group that has a great deal of problems is that of people with severe diabetes. The severe diabetics. if they have problems with the circulation in their feet. for example. the real tragedy might be that they might have their feet amputated. but isnt it strange that Medicare and Medicaid will not pay for that physician or that nurse to monitor the patients closelyto call them. to work with them. to do more than just give them a pamphlet. but to work closely with them to keep them out of the hospital. to make sure that they are getting their insulin. to make sure they are monitored for their weight. et cetera. but we will not pay for that? We will pay $50.000 for that tragic surgery that could have been avoided. but we will not pay money to help when they manage the care. Now I might say that there is a recent study that came out that. I believe. is. filled with methodological flaws. saying that disease management has some cuestionable applications. Unfortunately. they focused on those who oftentimes had the most severe illnesses. As I am sure many of the physicians. here tonight can attest. the real value is getting to that patient early or when the complications begin to show up rather than to wait until the end. I know. in my career as a psychologist. I had a patient who is now a deeply depressed. suicidal inpatient. When you could have been working with them years before. it makes a big difference in their outcomes. We have to make sure that the system that we allow here with health insurance and with physicians working with patients really allows for a great deal of predischarge planning. of working closely and individualizing that care and for making sure that it is there. Let me mention a couple of other things as we proceed forward. Recent legislation under the House set aside nearly $2 billion to help physician practices have health information technology. A good idea. The question is how it is done. If that health information technology is merely paying for keeping hospital records on a computer. that is not going to be enough because that is a passive system that only makes it a little easier to pull up records rather than having to wait for the records to arrive. What we need is a smart. interactive system that is pbrtable for the patient so that records follow the patient. not so that patients follow the records. We have to make sure it is private. that confidentiality is protected. and we have to make sure it is personal so that the relationship between doctor and patient is what is paramount here. That physician and information they dre obtaining and what they are writing whenever they have a diagnosis is a smart record that also helps provide information to that doctor about best practices. about feedback. about prescriptions. and even about the feedback of whether or not that patient got that prescription and if he is following through. It is all of those things. In todays world. because there is a shortage * of physicians and because insurance - with Medicare. Medicaid or private insurance oftentimes does not pay for having the physician actually work to follow up with the patient. then that health IT is just one. big. expensive thing on the desk of the physician. and it is not really providing the care they need. Let me mention one other thing here. and that has to do with point of care lab tests. The system we have designed is one whereand because some physicians have been found when they own the labsthe concern was were they overprescribing lab tests. I would love to hear some input from my physician colleagues on that. too. So what did they say? They said. Lets not allow physicians to do this at all. where sometimes the most valuable thing is if the physician says. I need an xray. I need a lab test. I need this information right away. Instead. they have to send that patient out to a lab or send the information out. It could be a couple of weeks before they would get it back. The best way to improve patient compliance is quicker information. Even to allow. for example. pharmacies and drug stores to provide some of this lab information would be more valuable. All this feeds into the system * that part of the way to save the $600 billion or $700 billion worth of loss in the health care system is to put the tools in the hands of those who provide the health care. Make sure there are enough physicians. Make sure they have the tools they need so that as they diagnose. as they prescribe. as they work with other colleagues in the health care field that that information is shared in an effective way that is personal. that is private. that is portable. and actually that is permanent. too. These are not records that are lost as a person moves on to another health care plan or whatever they do in life. Part of what we are doing here as the GOP Doctors Caucus is operating on the idea that we are all gathered together here to really work on making sure that we are developing patientcentered. patientdriven health care reforms based on quality. access. affordability. portability. and choice. Over the coming months. you will hear from us continually speak about this because we believe we have a health care system that can be based upon those. that can save massive amounts of money and that can save hundreds of thousands of lives. That needs to be our goal. not only to do no harm but to make sure we put health care back in,111120610,MURPHY,TIM,H,PA,M,R,18,voting,2009-03-23,277,Mr. TIM MURPHY of

1110030897,"Mr. President. I rise today in response to the devastating job losses resulting from the current economic crisis. Figures released this week show that U.S. companies shed more than 740.000 jobs in March. a 5 percent increase over the 706.000 jobs lost in February. Our country has now lost nearly 4.5 million jobs since the onset of the recessionthe most since 1945. Tomorrows release of governmentcompiled employment figures is certain to confirm the dismal state of the U.S. job marketa tragic reality that millions of hardworking Americans and the families they support know all too well. As a senior member of the Senate Committee on Commerce. Science and Transportation. I believe it is essential for the Department of Commerce to respond to this dire situation by focusing its efforts on expanding employment opportunities for Americans. With its statutory mission ""to foster. promote. and develop the foreign and domestic commerce."" the Departmentof Commerce has a clear mandate to defend and grow the U.S. economy through job preservation and creation. Yet the disparate agencies that comprise the department have little or no occasion to coordinate their efforts toward maximizing its job maintaining and creating potential. While divisions such as the Economic Development Agency and the Minority Business Development Agency each have their own. programs to increase employment in their respective target communities. there is the potential for even greater job creation through the coordination of their efforts with the core functions of other department components. such as the exportpromotion activities of the International Trade Administration. the economic analysis of the Economics and Statistics Administration. and the stewardship of technological innovation by the National Telecommunications & Information Administration. That is why I am today introducing bipartisan legislation with my Commerce Committee colleague Senator Begich to establish a Job Creation Coordinhtor at the department. Answering directly to the Secretary of Commerce. the Coordinator would not only ensure that each agency is carrying out its primary mission in a way that maximizes U.S. employment. but also would identify and implement opportunities to link separate programs being carried out by the agencies in a way that ensures that department resources are being spent in a manner which guarantees the utmost job creation per dollar appropriated. the tax burden on families and businesses. and focus on policies that will lead to job creation and economic growth. and Whereas taxpayers in the United States are expressing their opposition to high taxes and skyrocketing spending by the United States Government by organizing ""Taxed Enough Already"" parties. also known as ""TEA"" parties: Now. therefore. be it Resolved. That the Senate designates each of April 15. 2009. and April 15. 2010. as ""National TEA Party Day"".",111116501,SNOWE,OLYMPIA,S,ME,F,R,,voting,2009-04-02,1614,Ms. SNOWE,77143,77236,04022009.txt,2918,445,111,2009,mr presid rise today respons devast job loss result current econom crisi figur releas week show us compani shed job march percent increas job lost februari countri lost nearli million job sinc onset recessionth sinc tomorrow releas employ figur certain confirm dismal state us job marketa tragic realiti million hardwork american famili support know well senior member senat committe commerc scienc transport believ essenti depart commerc respond dire situat focus effort expand employ opportun american statutori mission foster promot develop foreign domest commerc departmentof commerc clear mandat defend grow us economi job preserv creation yet dispar agenc compris depart littl occas coordin effort toward maxim job maintain creat potenti divis econom develop agenc minor busi develop agenc program increas employ respect target commun potenti even greater job creation coordin effort core function depart compon activ intern trade administr econom analysi econom statist administr stewardship technolog innov nation telecommun inform administr today introduc bipartisan legisl commerc committe colleagu senat begich establish job creation depart answer directli secretari commerc coordin would ensur agenc carri primari mission way maxim us employ also would identifi implement opportun link separ program carri agenc way ensur depart resourc spent manner guarante utmost job creation per dollar appropri tax burden famili busi focu polici lead job creation econom growth wherea taxpay unit state express opposit high tax skyrocket spend unit state govern organ tax enough alreadi parti also known tea parti therefor resolv senat design april april nation tea parti day,247,FALSE
1110018893,I am a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. better known as the CBC. Cfrrently. the CBC is chaired by the Honorable BARBARA LEE from the Ninth Congressional District of California. My name is Congresswoman MARCIA FUDGE. representing the llth District of Ohio. CBC members are advocates for the human family nationally and internationally and have played a significant role as local and regional activists. We continue to work diligently to be the conscience of the Congress. But understand all politics are local. Therefore. we provide dedicated and focused service to the citizens and the congressional districts we serve. The vision of the founding members of the Congressional Black Caucus to promote the public welfare through legislation designed to meet the needs of millions of neglected. citizens continues to be our focal point for the legislative work and political activities of the Congressional Black Caucus today. More than ever. it is necessary that we. as leaders. help those whom we- serve. As the floor moderator today for the Congressional Black Caucus special order hour. I have to add that it is more important than ever that we put the money where our mouth is. For the past 8 years. we have lived in a cloud of corporate misdeeds. backroom dealings. and extreme tax cuts that have only benefited the wealthiest people in this Nation. Due to the Bush administrations lack of government oversight. intervention and inattention. we now face the toughest economy in our lifetime. Such neglect and inattention have led to this storm called a housing crisis. a collapse of the stock market and rising health care costs that leaves most Americans in a state of shock. In 2008. nearly 4 million jobs wire lost across the Nation. In _February of this year. the Greater Cleveland area unemployment rate was at a staggering 10.2 percent. The overall AfricanAmerican unemployment rate is even greater. currently over 13 percent. In these dire times. something must be done to help our Nation and our people get back on their feet. The best way to address these issues and illustrate our desire to better the lives of so many Americans is with our budget priorities for the upcoming fiscal year. I want to thank President Obama for his thoughtful budget that signals a new era of responsibility. I want to applaud his attention to our Nations most urgent needs. job training and job creation. health care and education. I would like to thank him for the particular attention that this budget gives to the mental health needs of our veterans. Finally. I applaud this administration for paying attention to those that need us the most. our children and our elderly. As the former mayor of Warrensville Heights. Ohio. and on behalf of all mayors and all local leaders. I want to focus on the administrations full funding of Community Development Block Grants. The fiscal year 2010 budget provides $4.5 billion to fully fund this program. As legislators. our number one priority is to get ourselves out of this current economic crisis. To accomplish this. we must look to programs that help improve and grow our economy. Historically. for every $1 of funding through a Community Development Block Grant. nearly $3 is leveraged for economic development projects. When a city needs a grocery store or more affordable housing. this block grant funding is utilized and helps build neighborhoods. This is one of the few programs where the money goes directly to the locality. It does not get tied up in State government or Federal affairs. The money immediately goes to the areas where local leaders can help expand economic opportunities for their local citizens. In Cleveland. Community Development Block Grant dollars have gone to assist our housing trust fund. Every dollar of investment leverages $5 of private investment. In 2008. housing trust fund funds were committed to projects that supported nearly 700 energy efficient housing units. This money has also gone to combat foreclosure. CDBG funds are the principal source of funds for supporting a range of activities to respond to the aftermath of foreclosures. This year. block grants can provide $300.000 for antipredatory lending programs administered by Clevelands Department of Consumer Affairs and other nonprofit agencies. over $400.000 for code enforcement and almost $900.000 for nuisance abatement and land reutilization on properties that are either vacant or have been through foreclosure. Community Development Block Grant dollars will help with housing services for low- or moderateincome families. These funds are a critical source of assistance for seniors and lowincome families with funding to repair their homes. This year over $2.2 million is expected to be used for home repair assistance from these funds. This grant will also helped communitybased organizations. Approximately $8 million supports a network of organizations that provide housing services. neighborhood safety programs and community outreach. Finally. CDBG funding will help citywide services. housing and financial services such as foreclosure counseling. homeownership counseling. landlord tenant counseling and fair housing assistance. The funds also support nonprofits that offer social services such as educational programming for youth and food programs for our seniors and lowincome families. Madam Speaker.

1110026086,"Mr. President. there are good examples. as Senator ENZI declared. of bipartisan work in this Senat. We have a lot of those examples. I would point out. however. that a budget is a document that tends to favor an individual partys belief. It tends to point out where they want to take the country. It is a roadmap for the country. and that budget is a vehicle to achieve the goals that party has. I want to say this about the budget: A budget is not jusb something an individual has to submit. The President submits one. but the numbers contained in it. the directions contained in it. are the choices made. You can choose to spend less. you can choose to spend more. you can choose to reduce debt. you can choose to increase debt. It might be more popular to spend more and run up more debt today. but it may not be good for the longterm interest of America. We just left the budget markup. and the Democratic majority passed out of the committee on a straight partyline votewith no Republicans supporting itwhat I believe is the most irresponsible budget in the history of our Nation. It takes our spending. as a percentage of the gross domestic product. to the highest level we have had since World War II. when we were fighting for our very existence. We had been attacked at Pearl Harbor. We were facing the Nazis and Hitler. The problems we face now are not like that. but that is the level of spending we have now. and it is a very dangerous thing. Does anybody doubt the conventional wisdom that nothing comes from nothing. that there is no free lunch. that somebody had to produce it. that debts must be paid when incurred. and that if you borrow money. you have to pay interest on it? Does anybody doubt that? From the beginning of the founding of our Republic until this year. we. the public. have accumulated $5 trillion in debt. That is the whole founding of our country. That is what we have accumulated. Under the budget that the President has submitted to Congressin a bound volume. carefully put togetherin 5 years alone that $5 trillion debt will double. and in the following 5 years it will triple. So in 5 years. we would add twice as much debtaccording to the Presidents own numbers he submitted to usas we have today and three times as much in 10 years. I am not making this up. These numbers are in the book. And it is pretty disturbing to me. The chairman offered an alternative budget. He got clever. He said: We will do a 5year budget. We wont do a 10year budget. We will move some things around and make things look better. and then we can all vote for it. That is basically what happened today. But when you look at it carefully. it is no big change. And the chairmans mark that was passed out of committee today. that mark is disturbing because it was less honest and it was more gimmicked up than the Presidents budget. . President Obamas budget was pretty honest about two or three big issues. OnQ of them is the alternative minimum tax fix. It costs quite a bit to fix that. We only fix it 1 year at a time. but we fix it every year. President Obama assumed we would fix it. I think he underestimated the cost of a 10year fix. but he had it in there. It cost hundreds of billions of dollars to do that$500 billion. I think it is probably closer to $700 billion or $800 billion. but that was in there. That was omitted from the chairmans mark that was voted out. But that is going to be fixed. and when you fix it. you reduce the alternative minimum taxs impact in the country. you lose revenue. and that makes your debt look worse. Also. every year we have been fixing the doctors reimbursement rate under the Balanced Budget Act. A decade ago. we required those payments to be cut. and we required them to be cut too much. They cant be cut that much. but that is the current law. They are dropped about 20 percent today. So every year. we come back and we put the money in. We spend the money necessary to keep the doctors with a modest increase in their reimbursement rate. We dont let them take a 20percent cut. The chairmans mark assumes we dont fix the doctors bills. That is not going to happen. That makes his numbers look somewhat better. But when charted out carefully. the Budget Committee. on the Republican side. put the numbers together and found discretionary spending over 5 years under the chairmans mark was 98.8 percentthe same as President Obamas budget. Total outlays over 5 years was 96.6 percentthe same as the Presidents budget. And revenue was 99.8 percentthe same. So it is basically the Presidents .budget. But since it was getting so much flak and that budget was so irresponsible. people wanted topretend that the budget they voted out of the committee was more responsible and deserved more support. But it is just not so. really. There is nothing in it that suggests a confronting of the serious financial situation we are in. It has an incredible increase in spending. and that is why the debts are so large. It creates these deficits. As I indicated. we go from $5 trillion to $10 trillion in debt held by the public in 5 years. Where does that $5 trillion come from? Where does it come from? It comes from borrowing. And you borrow by going out and offering Treasury bills on the U.S. Treasury. You offer people an opportunity to buy them. and you pay them interest to loan you the money. So they loan you the money. and you pay them interest. We have been in a time in which the interest rates have been unusually low because people were so scared around the world and other countries were shakier than we were. and so they wanted to buy Treasury billsbecause we always pay them. basically. We have historically been a very safe investment. So that is how we get there. We borrow the money. Now. I want to suggest that costs money. I am not making these numbers up. These are the numbers that the Congressional Budget Office calculated. The Congressional Budget Office is hired by the Congress--both Houses of Congressthough it is controlled by the Democratic majority. They essentially have the final choice on who becomes the head of that office and who can control that office. But CBO takes pride in being nonpartisan and doing the right numbers. We use them a lot. They are the best numbers we can get. This is what they have calculated that interest payments on the debt will be. People can understand interest. How much are you paying on your credit card in interest? How much are you paying on your house note in interest? When you borrow money. you pay interest. When the United States borrows another $5 trillion. we pay interest on that 5. plus the 5 we have already borrowed. Ad when it goes to $17 trillion. as CBO expects this budget deficit to do based on the budget the President sent us. you would see these kinds of numbers. And these are the Presidents numbers. but on these numbers. I think he is low. I trust CBO. But we will look at both of them. According to CBOs estimates. we will spend $170 billion for interest this year. It goes up slowly. In 2011. $216 billion. then $282 billion. $460 billion. $601 billion. $734 billion. and in the 10th year. $806 billion in interest. One years interest. How much of that is for foreign countriesChina and Saudi Arabia and other countries who bought our Treasury bills? That is $806 billion. How much is $806 billion? My State of Alabama is an averagesize Statemaybe a little smaller. not muchand we are about onefiftieth the population of the country. Our entire general fund budget. including our State school spending and teachers. is less than $10 billion a year. The Government will be. paying $806 billion in interest in 1 year. The Federal highway program today is $40 billion. We send that out to the States. where they get an 8020 or a 9010 split. and they use it to repair interstates and highways. and they do a lot with that. It is $40 billion. Were talking about 20 times as much as the highway money. ""I am very concerned about that interest number. Can we not understand why this is important? And we are not sure what this number will be because we are not perfectly sure what the interest rates will be. There are some developments today in the world that cause us quite a bit of concern. In the Washington Post today. there is a report that the President of the European Union blasted U.S. spending. Subheadline: ""Czech Premier Calls Obama Administrations Economic Policies a Road to Hell."" The article is talking about the United States urging other countries to borrow more money and spend more money. as we have done. Let me quote from the article: Some countries. led by Germany. have strongly resisted. predicting that such a path could lead to unsustainable debts and runaway inflation. Luxembourgs prime minister ... who heads a coordinating body... said European countries had already spent enough to jumpstart their economies. They havent spent as much as we have. yet we are urging them to spend more. To further quote from the article: The European stimulus plans are muscular. They are demanding. they are important in volume and in quality. . . . There was ""no question"" that the European Union would reject requests from Obama to spend more. Well. what happens when you do that? What happens when you borrow too much money? There was an article in todays Washington Times talking about Mr. Geithners difficulties in misspeaking and causing the dollar to plunge and the market to plunge. and then rebalance after he corrected himself. The article said: By afternoon. a poor showing of buyers at a Treasury bond auction sent interest rates sharply higher. raising fears about the U.S. ability to sell a massive load of $2.5 trillion of debt this year. It goes on to say: Buyers may have been spooked by ... the unveiling of budget plans on Capitol Hill that would double the amount of debt the Treasury has to sell in the next 5 years to nearly $12 trillion. * The markets are worried about this. So if you are going to buya Treasury bill and you think the United States is selling too many of them: or there are too many on the market and not enough money out there to buy them. or the interest rates are low and you want higher interest rates. you just dont buy. And then what is going to happen? To sell our bonds. to get people to loan us money. we are going to have to promise to pay them higher interest rates. That is the deal. The New York Times had an article about this a month- ago. Chairman CONRAD. our very able chairman of the Budget Committee. passed it out to our committee members. This is a warning. When you get too much debt and you are demanding that too many people loan you money. countries such as Chinawhich have. a fraction of the surplus in their trade account today than they had a rumber of years agoare not going to buy as much of our debt. even if they wanted to. because they do not have the money to buy it with. Who is going to buy this? To get enough people to send ustheir money to finance our spending spree. we are going to end up having to pay higher interest rates. That is a fact. The article goes on to say: The mounting worries about the debt also snuffed out a rally in the stock market ... He talked about China. You have heard a lot of people talk about China and buying our Treasury bills and our concern about being obligated to them. This is what the article said today: China and other investors recently have taken to worrying about whether the United States may debase its currency in its drive to address economic problems. I think the world is worrying about that. Are we going to debase our currency? Are we going to inflate our currency to bail ourselves out and pay back those who loaned us money with dollars worth less than the dollars they loaned to us? If they think that. what they will demand is even higher interest rates. Because then they have to have interest rates that will assure them that even if the money is inflated. they will be paid back in an amount similar to that which they loaned us. It goes on to say: But the investors worry about the lingering effects of the legacy of debt and the inflationary impact of the Federal Reserves program to help finance that debt with $300 billion of Treasury bond purchases. So the Federal Reserve is basically printing money and buying these Treasury bills themselves to try to help us out. and that is worrying people because nothing comes from nothing. Debts must be repaid. It goes on to say: Apprehension about these matters is apparently what led to the Treasurys difficulty in selling $24 billion of the fiveyear notes Wednesday afternoon. That is yesterday afternoon. To attract buyers. the Treasury had to pay interest rates that were significantly higher than its previous auction. touching off fears about the nations ability to finance ever bigger loads of debt in the future. It didnt help that Britain on Tuesday experienced its first failed bond auction in nearly seven years--a bad portent since Britain. like the United States. has gone deeply into debt to finance large economic stimulus and bank bailout programs. The Brits have followed us. The Central Europeans are saying no. The Brits are spending like we are and the other countries are rejecting that. They pushed back and we have urged them to spend like we do and they said: No. we are not going to do it. I think it is embarrassing. It is mortifying to me. as an American who believes in limited Government. lower taxes. and free enterprise. to be in a position where we are being lectured by the Europeans and told no. when we want to spend more. tax more. and create more debt and they are saying it is irresponsible. We have always believed we were more responsible and we had more honesty in our system and we were more frugal in what we spent and our economy has been more robust than the European economies over the last 15 or 20 years. But now it looks like the situation has shifted. CreditSightsan organization that deals with these- kinds of interest issues--CreditSights Ms. Purtle was quoted in the article. She said that: . . . the most serious problem the Treasury faces is a lack of buyers worldwide for its growing mountain of debt. In particular. countries like China and Japan that invested their trillions of dollars in export earnings in the Treasury market have been hit by plummeting exportsThey are not selling as much as they used to. -which means they have less money to invest in Treasury Bonds. she said. She concludes by saying: ""... funds simply arent available to continue the purchases."" That is something I have been talking about for some time. It is pretty obvious. unless you believe something can come from nothing. Julie Andrews had it right: Nothing comes from nothing. nothing ever could. In the course of this debate. a lot of efforts were carried out to try to do something about the stark numbers that are revealed in the Presidents bound book he sent to us. This chart reflects what is in his book. I didnt make up the numbers. They came right out of the book he wrote. or his staff did. and it reflects the total of the debt held by the public which is the best hard number we have. I think. of what the debt of the country is. We start out in 2008 with $5.03 trillion. You can see the deficits. how they increase. By the first 5 years. debt held by the public is $11.55 trillion. virtually a doubling in 5 years of that debt. Then. in the 10th year. it is $15.370 trillion. more than three times the amount. about three times the point of the 2008 figure. The numbers dont lie. Nobody is disputing this. They are saying. you know what. as my colleague said on the floor in a very partisan speech: Well. we are investing. We admit we are in a changed environment. We are trying to do things in a different way. and get over it. you guys. you mossbacks. worrying about debt. Dont worry about debt. Dont worry about spending. We are investing. We are going to spend more in educationlike we havent done that year after yearand we are going to have such an improvement in the quality of our graduates it is going to make America better and we are going to pay all this back. I guess that is what the argument is. But at some point. you just dont have the money. We do not have the money. It would be nice if we could double every -program in the world. Maybe well send more as foreign aid. Somebody offered that amendment in the Budget Committee today to spend more on foreign aid. Spend everything more and more and it will all work out. I do not think that is acceptable. and these numbers represent. I contend. the most irresponsible budget since World War II. and since we were in a lifeordeath struggle in World War II. those deficits were necessary. Well. somebody might say: SESSIONS. we are in a recession. That is why the Presidents numbers look bad. But hold your hat: the Presidents budget says we will have. this year. a negative GDP of 1.2 percent. He projects in this budget. to make .the numbers look better. actuallyI think. that is the only thing I can say. I hope it would be righthe projects that unemployment would cap out. the highest we would ever have in this recession is 8.1 percent. It .is already at 8.1 percent. Wouldnt it be great if it doesnt get any higher? Maybe it wont. I surely hope not. but I suspect it will. Look at this. This is the projections through 5 years. He doesnt projectthe reason we are having these deficits is not- because of lack of economic growth. The reason we have these deficits is spending. unprecedented spending. Look. in 2009. this fiscal year ending September 30. they predict a GDP decline of 1.2 percent. The independent. Blue Chip consensus. which is the most respected group. they project it will be worse. at 2.6 percent. In 2010. that is next yearwe are in 2009. In 2010. the President is projecting 3.2 percent growth. That is robust growth. That is not a little growth. that is robust growth. In 2011. it is 4.0. 2012. 4.6. 2013. 4.2. The point I am trying to make is. the reason the deficits are here in the outyears is not because the President is saying we are going to be in a sustained economic slowdown. President Clinton in his best years in the 1990s. President Reagan in his best years. I think it very rarely broke 4 percent or 5 percent growth. Four percent growth is robust growth. Great Scott. it would be great to have that every year. We are not having these deficits because we are assuming we are going to be in an economic slowdown or a war. That is not assumed either because the defense budget is one thing that is getting reduced. Amendments were offered. Senator GREGG offered an amendment. the -ranking Republican on the committeeand such a smart and experienced member of the committee. To get into the European Union. you have to commit that your annual deficit will not exceed 3 percent of your GDP and that your total debt will not exceed 60 percent of your gross domestic product. the GDP. This budget. I think. is taking us--this is where we are. In 2009. this year. we are at 55 percent of GD? is our debt. It goes up next year to 61. in 2010. because of the budget. with such huge deficits. That already takes us outside of being admitted in the European Union. The European Union says if you are going to be a member of our economic union. you have to show you have financial discipline in your country. Every new member has to go through this. But under the Presidents budget in 2011. it is 64 percent. in 2012. it is 65 percent. 2013. it is 66 percent. and 2014. it is 66 percent. I think it hits about 80 percent. It goes on up in the second 5 years. This is a troubling trend. So Senator GREGG said: Why dont we at least make it a situation in which at least to pass a budget such as this you have to have 60 votes if we violate the standards of the European Union? It was voted down. Every Democrat voted against that reform. that containment mechanism. Senator GREGG also offered an amendment dealing with the budget presented by the chairman. I think he had a little humor in him when he offered this. The budget presented by the chairman projected a 7percent increase in spending this year. 7 percent over the baseline. But over 5 years. he claimed it only would increase spending by about 2.5 percent. That is pretty good. a 2.5percent increase. It is not great. I offered an amendment lower than that but 2.5 percent. OK? Then. Senator CRAPO. a Republican member of the committee and a very. experienced and knowledgeable person. he said one thing I have learned around here. the budget that counts is the one for this year. You can project anything in your next years budget and the next years budget and the fourth and fifth years budget. You can project- any spending level you want because we will be back here next year. sitting in this room. and we will be voting on what this years increase will be. In other words. it appeared we were dealing with a gimmick. It appeared we were talking about spending a lot this year in the budget that counts--this fiscal yearand having reductions next year when we will have every opportunity to increase it. OK. So Senator CRAPO says: OK. you said you are going to keep it at 2 percent. That is what your budget says. I am going to offer an amendment that sets up a budget point of order that takes 60 votes if you go above that. Fair enough. right? So if next yearactually. I think next year they are pro-. posing a 1percent increase. which is not going to happen. I assure you. And he proposed we hold them to that 2.5. and we would have a 60vote point of order if they went over 2.5. Every Democrat voted it down because they knew they were not going to stay at 2.5. Everybody knows it. I will just say this: No matter what is in the budget that comes out of this Senate. if it is any kind of real reduction from President Obamas budget. and I do not think it will be. but if it is. when it goes to conference and they meet with Speaker PELOSI. they are going to put the money back in. When the bill comes over here. it is going to essentially be the Obama budget. We have seen that is the tone of this discussion. So that -is why he offered that amendment. That is why they .voted it down. because they flatly intend not to stick to a 2.5percentperyear spending increase in nondefense discretionary spending. Senator LINDSEY GRAHAM offered an amendmentget thisthat would limit each households share of the debt in America to $80.000 per household. Our debt today is $60.000 per household. The Federal debt. if divided out per household. is $60.000. So Senator GRAHAM said: Well. lets just put a mechanism in here. if you go over $60.000 and get up to $80.000. we have a budget point of order. at least it would take twothirds to pass it. No. They voted that down because the budget clearly puts us on a track to go well above $80.000 per household. It would have the potential to bite and be a potential way to contain this growth of spending. Senator ALEXANDER offered an amendment that said there would be a budget point of order if the amount of our total debt reached 90 percent of the gross domestic product of our country. I just told you that you cannot get in the European Union if your debt exceeds 60 percent of your GDP. But this budget puts us on track to going beyond 90 percent of GDP. and Senator ALEXANDER offered an amendment. How reasonable is that? And it was voted down. on a straight partyline vote. Senator CORNYN offered an amendment that would create a 60vote point of order if we doubled the debt. If we double our debt. we ought to at least have 60 votes to do that. It was voted down. straight partyline vote. These are troubling instances. We are not making this up. The issue is critical for the future of our Nation. It also says something more than just debt. it says this President meant something when he said: We are going to remake the American economy. At a point in last years campaign. many will remember this. when our President met Joe the Plumber. and he said: Well. we are going to take this money and spread it around a little bit. Joe. People said: Wait a minute. Was that revealing who he really was? Is not that the socialist impulse to take money from people who have it and spend it on people you want to have it? Is not that the socialist impulse? People talked about President ObamaSenator Obama thenis that the way he really thinks? Is that what he is going to do if.he gets elected? Oh no. they said. we are not socialists. We do not believe in those things. But budgets are not campaign rhetoric. The campaign is over. We are dealing with real books. a proposal to triple the debt in 10 years out of his budget office. with his name on it. I think the name of the budget document is ""A New Era of Responsibility."" That is what is on it. That is what is right here. Here it is. ""A New Era of Responsibility."" You tbll me how tripling the debt is an era of responsibility. You tell me how raising the interest payment per year from $170 billion to $800 billion is responsible. in 10 years. It is not responsible. We will have this debate next week. The Members will have a chance to speak about it and talk about it. For some people listening out there in the great American countryside. you may think this is just another RepublicanDemocratic dustup. just another flimflam fight. a burning of political hot air about nothing. And why does everybody not get together and just agree and work in a bipartisan way and pass something? Well. what if they passed something that you think is bad for America. the legislation that has been offered. Every amendment that will make a difference gets voted down on a straight partyline vote. and it is going to be voted out of this Senate with an overwhelming partisan vote. I doubt a single Republican will vote for it. But because a budget is passedunlike most legislationwith a simple miajority. there are plenty of votes to pass this. So there have been a lot of votes in this Senate. and a lot of times Republicans. I have often thought. have saved our Democratic colleagues from themselves by taking the hard votes by asking: How much is it going to cost? Do we really have the money? And not vote for things that in the long run have not been wise for America. OK. It is not going to happen this time because the votes are here. Senator REED. the majority leader. has the votes. This budget is going to pass. I suppose it is possible that the American people will have their voices heard and something could change and it could come out better. That would be my hope. But unless something changes in the dynamic. and the only thing that can change this dynamic is if the American people make their voices heard through their representatives and tell them that is not what we intended when we voted for President Obama. Or almost half the people voted for JOHN MCCAIN. that is not what we intended you guys to do. You did not tell us you were going to triple the debt. You did not tell us you were going to do these things. What about our Member who ran for reelection recently in the last several years? They have been attacking President Bush. They have been attacking President Bush as a profligate spender and saying they were going to do better. This is better? Give me a break. Lets talk about that. I think a relevant year is 2003. after 9/11. after that recession. the commencement of the war on terrorism. President Bush had a deficit of around $400 billion. He was savagely criticized for that. and some of that was justified. At the time that was the biggest deficit since World War II. It dropped for 3 consecutive years. In 2007. the year before last. the budget had dropped to $161 billion. We were on a good path. and then this recession hit. The President sent out $150 billion last year. unwisely. That did very little good. All of a sudden the deficit last year. September 30. was $459 billion. Well. that was the biggest since World War II. And I think he was rightly criticized for that. I did not vote to send out the checks. Sorry. constituents. I did not think it was going to work. I do not think it has. Most economists say it did not benefit us. But this year. hold your hats. with the $800 billion stimulus bill we passed this year. the deficit for this 1 year will not be $455 billion. $600 billion. $700 billion. $800 billion. $1.000 billion. No. it is $1.8 trillion. It is $1.8 trillion this fiscal year. and they are scoring the Wall Street bailout all this year. They are scoring Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae this year. There are some onetime things in that score. But next year it is going to be $1.1 trillion. according to the Congressional Budget Office. If you look at Congressional Budget Office numbers--here are the Presidents numbers. He projects. with a robust growing economy. the debt will be $1.75 trillion in 2009. $1.1. almost $1.2 trillion in 2010. almost $900 billion in 2011. and he goes down. And it starts coming back up in the outyears when he has solid growth and no projections of an economic slowdown. He projects continued growing deficits to $712 billion. And that is that 1 year. OK. There is not a single year. not a single year in these 10 years of the Presidents budget that the deficit is as low as the highest deficit President Bush ever had. Not one. But my staff tells me. lets not forget. that is the Presidents score. It has been doctored too. It is really worse than that based on the money they plan to spend. Our own Congressional Budget Office. controlled by the majority Members of our body. this is what they have for the deficit. They have this year being $1.845 trillion. $1.845 billion. 1.4 the next year. not at $712 billion but at $1.2 trillion in the tenth year. So that is why Senator CONRAD. our Democratic chairman. has said it is unsustainable. You cannot sustain these kind of deficits. even with a healthy economy. USA Today. when this crisis began to hit us. they wrote an article that said simply this: An economy founded on excessive personal debt. excessive Government debt. and excessive trade deficits is not healthy. So what we have to do is get off debt and get back to an honest growth economy that we have always been able to have. We have had a clear housing bubble that has burst. It has impacted the financial community significantly. We have done a lot of things. Some of them are of dubious value. But we have done a lot of things to work our way through. and certainly President Obama projects the economy to bounce back strongly. But we cannot keep spending. We have to control that. So as we go forward next week. I hope the American people will be alert to the most important issues. that they will make their voices heard. that all of our colleagues will go home. and as they sit down in quiet time. ask themselves: Can I vote for this? Can I go on record as voting for a plan that will increase the annual interest payment of Americans from $170 billion to $800 billion? And I am going to triple the debt in our country in 10 years. put us on a plan that will do that? I think not. I hope not. I encourage my colleagues to study it carefully and vote no and let us see if we cannot come back with a much better budget. The only way to fix some of these issues is a bipartisan effort because some of those spending programs are tough. They have been growing out of control. It is going to take mature. tough decisionmaking to bring it under control. Some special interests are going to holler as soon as you try to do it. and you have to listen to them. But you cannot let them set the national policy. You cant let the person who is getting a benefit from a single program set a policy that adversely impacts everybody else in the country. That is what we are paid to do. to make the tough choices. We are not doing it now. The Presidents budget is not responsible. I hope we can confront it honestly and make some positive changes. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.",111118411,SESSIONS,JEFFERSON,S,AL,M,R,,voting,2009-03-26,460,Mr. SESSIONS,28528,29476,03262009.txt,32042,5869,111,2009,mr presid good exampl

1110064225,I thank the gentleman for yielding. Let me again express the fact that I believe this bill has received the most extensive consideration of any bill since I have been in Congress. and that hasnt always happened. The gentleman has been here for a number of years. and he was here. I believe. on June 25. 2003. He recalls that that was a bill which was the most massive change in Medicare in over a quarter of a century. The gentleman probably recalls that bill. the prescription drug bill. referred to affectionately. I know the gentleman must clearly remember how we considered that bill. But just on the off chance he doesnt. let me remind him. On June 25. 2003. a new version was introduced and referred to committee. Hear me. New bill. introduced. referred to committee on June 25. On June 26. at 6:20 a.m. in the morning. a rule for martial law was considered by the Rules Committee. with 3 hours of debate and a Rangel substitute permitted with 1 hour of debate. On June 26 at 6:55 p.m.. debate began pursuant to House Resolution 299. Then the House proceeded with 3 hours of general debate. On 6/276/27at 2:32 a.m.. there was a 50minute vote. and the bill passed 216215 after all of about 36 hours of exposure from introduction to passage. Now. that bill. of course. went to conference. and it came back from conference. Let me remind my friend about the timing on the conference report. On 11/21/2003 at 1:17 a.m.. the conference report was filed. At 11/21/2003 at 3:41 a.m.. 2 hours and approximately 20 minutes later. martiallaw consideration of conference report by the Rules Committee. At 11/21. the same day. 2003. at 11:26 p.m.-now this started at 1:17 a.m. in the morningat 11:26 p.m.. it passed the House. the rule. Now. at 11:36 p.m.. 10 minutes later10 minutes laterMr. Thomas brought up the conference report for consideration. At 1i/ 22. at 2:39 a.m.. we began to vote. I am sure you remember that vote. It took 3 hours. Now. of course. we had had this under consideration from the day before at 1:17 a.m. when the conference report was reported back. This side of the aisle won for 2 hours and 45 minutes while you spent time changing votes on your side of the aisle. You were ultimately successful. About 2 hours and 55 minutes into that particular vote. the longest vote which I have considered. and. frankly. the longest time this was considered as a piece of legislation. you changed the votes. And it won. 211222. at 11/22 at 5:50 a.m. In other words. consideration of the conference report was laid on the table at 11/21/2003 for the Rules Committee consideration. and by 11/22 at 5:50 a.m.. about 30 hours later. it was passed. I tell my friend in reviewing this. this was an 800page bill. by the way. no extensive hearings on that bill. By the way. when you had press conferences regarding that bill. none of us were invited. You know that and I know that. I would tell me friend with all due respect. this saying that the Democrats have rolled out a bill. we rolled out a bill 4 months ago.

Im honored today to join my colleagues in supporting the Pay for Performance Act. a measure designed to ensure that taxpayers dollars are used wisely to protect our financial institutions. and I want to applaud the work done on this issue by Representatives GRAYSON and HIMES. The recently disclosed AIG bonuses highlight the potential for abuses of the public trust by companies rewarding employees with excessive compensationall on the taxpayer dime. This legislation will ensure that companies receiving TARP funds tie pay to performance.

Immediately after the war. the Hamas folks immediately began to try to restore those tunnels. and we understand that. But there are specific steps now to counter that in new means which I will not go into here on the floor of the SenateI cant. But Egypt has agreed to engage in a significantly ratchetedup effort. Since there is additional money and that is exactly what is contained. again. I say this is unnecessary. particularly given the impact that this might have on this bill if it were to pass. So we have three reasons there. One. the problem is being addressed. Two. it does have an impact on the Egyptians in terms of what they have already agreed to. given the fact that we have agreed to it. Three. it has a huge damaging impact on the overall omnibus bill we are trying to pass.

1110067214,Mr. President. I thank Senator CORKER. I have had the distinct pleasure of delivering over 2.500 babies for Medicaid insurance and taking care of their children. These are wonderful folks. I didnt do any differential between Medicaid and private insurance in my practice. but most of my colleagues did. The heartbreaking part about Medicaid is that when you have a sick child who needs a specialist. you cannot get one. You just cannot get one. You say: Why cant you? Do they not care? Yes. they care. But you know what. Because of the Medicaid reimbursement for pediatric subspecialitiespediatric cardiologists. pediatric oncologists. pediatric hematologiststhere are not any. We only have two pediatric cardiologists in the city of Tulsa serving 1.9 million people. Try to get an appointment for a Medicaid patient there. I can hardly get a regular one. How did that happen? The reason we have a shortage of pediatric subspecialities is directly related to the Medicaid system in this country because the reimbursement is so low that you cannot afford to have a high percentage of Medicaid patients in your practice and still pay your bills. So what consequently has happened is doctors do not go into pediatrics. and then they do not go into the subspecialities of pediatrics. So I end up having 8monthold children seen by adult cardiologists or adult hematologists because there is no available doctor to see them because we have created a system through the substandard reimbursement of Medicaid that has directed people coming out of medical school away from that speciality. As a matter of fact. last year. if you take all the medical students who graduated from medical college. whether it is osteopaths or allopaths. M.D.s or D.O.s. 1 in 50 went into primary care. That is general internal medicine. family practice. or pediatrics. only 1 in 50. We have 50 million baby boomers going to hit Medicare in the next 71/2 years. and we are not going to have the primary care doctors there to take care of them. The reason is because through government programs. we have incentivized doctors not to do primary care. Consequently. we dont get there. The other point I will tell you is that if you look at perinatal mortality rates in our population across the country. it is. No. 1. directly related more to poverty than it is to anything else. But the second most important factor is that if you are in Medicaid. you are twice as likely to have a perinatal mortality eventin other words. your child dies after childbirththan if you are in private insurance. It doesnt matter what your culture is. If you are poor. but you have private insurance. the likelihood your baby is going to do better is greater. Think about that: a promise we are going to give you care. but the result of the care is going to be less good. We are going to give you care. but it is not as good care. and it is not available care. We are going to make you wait in line. but we are going to call it care. Care delayed is care denied. Let me say that again. Care delayed is care denied. If. in fact. you have a problem that needs attention. and you cannot get what you need. it does not matter what Medicaid does if you cannot get treatment. If you look at the subspecialities in Medicaid. 65 percent of them do not see Medicaid patients. We have about 40 percent in primary care who will not see a Medicaid patient. We have about 65 percent of the specialities. because there is such a shortage in the specialities. that what we are saying is we are going to have 60 million people in a system that says: You get care. but guess what. It is not available. you are on Medicaid. Senator WYDEN did offer a plan. I say to Senator CORKER. that would put every Medicaid patient in this country. except dual eligibles. into private insurance. So did we with the Patients Choice Act. the first bill introduced on our side of the aisle. We take the stigma off saying you have a lowpaying plan. and we give them the same kind of insurance we have right here in this body. By doing it. we save the States $1 trillion over the next 10 years. Think about that. But that isnt nearly as important as we have a major increase in the positive outcomes for Medicaid patients. You cannot talk about Medicaid without talking about Indian health care because as you add up Medicaid to Medicare to TRICARE to VA to Indian health care. when you add all that up. the government is running 61 percent of our health care right now. No wonder we are in trouble. I do not deny there are big problems with the insurance industry. I do not deny we need a Patients Bill of Rights that protects peoples rights and their interests. I do not deny we need transparency in the insurance industry both on price and quality. I do not deny anything. The question we ought to ask is. if we are going to truly reform health care. are we going to allow everybody. when they say they have health care. no matter where they get it. to have an equal shot at getting equal care? You see. this bill does not do that. This bill puts Medicaid patients in jail and says: If you happen to be lucky enough. the lucky 60 percent to get into the line. you will be OK. And if you need a subspecialty. if you happen to be part of the lucky 35 percent. you will be OK. But everybody else is in jail. You are in monopoly jail. We are promisingthe governmentto do that. A final pointand then I will yield so others can talkis the idea that my StateTexas is a big State. It is our southern neighbor. They sometimes have a better football team than we do. They certainly did this year. We are about oneeighth the size of Texas in terms of population. We cannot afford $2.8 billion over the next 10 years. I say to Senator CORNYN. We are going to say we are going to cover 15 million people and some of those will be in Oklahoma. We cannot afford it. What we can afford is to insure them if we make true changes in care. if we truly change and incentivize preventive care. management of chronic diseaseif we truly reform health care. These bills do not reform health care. What they do is grow government. They are not going to change outcomes. other than except they are going to limit what you can and cannot do through costeffective comparativeness. As we look at this bill. what we need to do is think about those we are going to promise something we are not going to deliver. We are going to call it a system. but they are not going to have it available.

1110075716,Mr. President. I appreciate the comments of both my colleagues from Louisiana and Oklahoma touching on an issue that I think is becoming increasingly important to a lot of Americans. I was listening this morning to one of my colleagues on the other side as he came down here and talked about how all the spending problems and all these debt problems were all inherited from the previous administration. There is sort of a Bushphobia or something around here among Members on the other side because they do not want to own up for the decisions they have made. Granted. I would be the first one to admit that when Republicans were in control of the Congress. we didnt do it right all the time and we lost our way a little bit with regard to spending. But having said that. we now havesince 2006a Democratic Congress. I need to remind my colleagues that the President doesnt spend a dime under our Constitution. Congress has the power of the purse. Congress appropriates funds. So if you look at the last several years in terms of appropriations. going back to the last couple of years that the Republicans were in control of the Congress. the amount of spending in the nondefense part of the budget was a negative 1 percent in 2007. 5 percent in 2006. and 8 percent in 2005. That is nondefense discretionary spending in our annual appropriations. If you go to total growth. which includes defense. you are talking about 8 percent in 2005. 5 percent in 2006. and 2 percent in 2007more than most people would argue we needed to be spending in annual appropriations bills. But the Democrats took control of the Congress after the 2006 election. so they started writing the budgets. We have ownership for the 2007 budget. but the Democrats have ownership for 2008. 2009. and 2010. The 2008 budget grew at 9 percent total growth. Nondefense discretionary spending grew at 6 percent. If you look at nondefense discretionary spending in 2009. the last fiscal year. it was 12 percent. In this fiscal year. 2010. the estimate is that we will spend 17 percent over the previous year. So yearoveryear spending in nondefense discretionary appropriations here in the Congress will have grown almost 30 percent in the last 2 years. That is not a problem that was created by the Bush administration. That is not a problem. obviously. for which the Republican majority was responsible. That is the Democrats. when they took control of the Congress after the 2006 elections. beginning in 2007. They write the budgets. they approve the appropriations bills. Obviously. as you can see. the numbers have gone up dramatically12 percent in the 2009 budget year. and the 2010 estimate for which we are now funding appropriations billsand we have funded most of them now with the omnibus or with the smaller appropriations bills. the six bills that were passed just a week or two agolooking at 17 percent yearoveryear spending in appropriations. So that is almost 30 percent in the last 2 budget years. That is not a problem the other side can hold the previous administration responsible for or attack them for. I will also mention that the $1 trillion approved earlier this year in the stimulus funding was approved on almost party lines. There were a couple of Republicans who supported that. but for the most part that was something approved by the Democratic majority. It was proposed by the President of the United States. That is not spending for which the former President is responsible. At some point around here. people have to own up and take responsibility for their own decisions. You cannot blame the past administration. You cannot blame inherited problems for all the spending that is going on right here. right now. The last year. as I said. appropriations spendingand this year againwas by any stretch way above anything we have seen or should see at a time when we have an economy in recession and most Americans are having to tighten their budgets12 percent nondiscretionary increase in 2009 and 17 percent increase in spending in 2010. With that and the stimulus spending. it brings us to where we are today. which is this massive expansion of the Federal Government-$2.5 trillion in new spending for a new entitlement program. That. too. is not something for which the previous administration is responsible. That is something this administration. the majority here in the Congress. has decided they want to push through. They want to finish it before the Christmas holiday. They want to get this in the rearview mirror before the American people have an opportunity to see what is in it. particularly in the last hurried rush here over the weekend where we got the 400page amendment that included all the special lastminute deals that were made to try to get that elusive 60th vote. What we have seen is now the $2.5 trillion in new spending is filled with all kinds of goodies that are going to favor individual Senators and individual States. The American people are starting to react. The point I want to make about this is. the one thing that the President and a lot of our colleagues on the other side have been talking about is how this reduces the deficit. This saves $132 billion over the next 10 years. Just remember that is $132 billion over 10 years. If you look at what the deficit was for the month of October. if any of my colleagues know what the deficit was for the month of October. 1 month alone. this last October. it was $176 billionin 1 month. They are crowing about $132 billion in savings over a 10year period. What is interesting about that $132 billion. if you take away all the gimmicks and you look at all the phony accounting that has been done to get to that number. it goes down in a real hurry. For example. the SGR fix. the physician reimbursement issue is a $200 billionplus item. Lets say they are saying they got $132 billion in savings over the next 10 years. But at some point you have to deal with that $200 billion SGR. If you take that away. you end up with a negative $68 billion already. Then you add in this CLASS Act. which everybody who has any sense. any actuary has absolutely denounced. including even the Washington Post. But if you look at what the CLASS Act does. they are using the revenues in the first early years that come from the premiums paid in. That money will be spent. So when it comes time to pay out benefits. there isnt going to be any money there. But they are showing a $72 billion savings or addition to their socalled savings in that first 10 years from the CLASS Act. The chairman of the Budget Committee has called the CLASS Act a Ponzi scheme of the first order. something that Bernie Madoff would be proud of. You take that $72 billion out. which the Congressional Budget Office says is going to add huge deficits in the outyears. you take out that $72 billion. and you are already at a $130 billion deficit. We havent even dealt with the fact that because of the way they have set this up. by front end loading the tax increases and back end loading spending. that understates the total cost. In the first 10 years. if you take those first 4 years when you have $56 billion of revenue coming in and only $9 billion of spending going out. that is another $47 billion that you could add to the deficit. So you have gone from $132 billion in savings to a $177 billion deficit. That is before you even get to the more important issue. which is what the CBO came out with today in response to a question by the Senator from Alabama asking: How can you count money that is going to come from these Medicare cuts. count that as revenue that will save and extend the life of Medicare. and still spend it for a new entitlement program on health care? The CBO basically said that is double counting. In fact. I want to read what they said: To describe the full amount of HI trust fund savings as both improving the governments ability to pay future Medicare benefits and financing new spending outside of Medicare would essentially doublecount a share of those savings and thus overstate the improvement in the governments fiscal position. Every American knows you cant spend the same money twice. That is what this does. They are going to cut $1 trillion over 10 years. when fully implemented. out of Medicare. but they will spend that money on a new entitlement program and still count the savings in Medicare. You cant have it both ways. The American people have figured out this shell game. When you take a $177 billion deficit after you take out all these accounting gimmicks. you are already running a significant deficit. Then when you add in the fact that what the CBO now says. what most of us have believed to be true and have been arguing. that you cant spend the same money twice. you cannot doublecount that revenue. the Medicare trust fund is going to take a significantly big hit. I know the Senator from Alabama is going to talk more extensively about that. I want to point that out because we are going into a big debate about raising the debt limit. Everybody. now that the horse is out of the barn. wants to shut the gate. But you cant spend $2.5 trillion on a new entitlement program and then claim to be fiscally responsible or say that you are doing something to reduce the deficit. Interestingly enough. the CMS Actuary said these Medicare cuts are unlikely to be sustainable on a permanent basis. We all know we are not going to cut $1 trillion out of Medicare over the first 10 years. That just doesnt happen here. All that money is going to get borrowed and put on the debt or they will have to raise taxes to pay for it. You cant have it both ways. As we get into the debate about the debt limit. it is important to put things into context. I want to say again that $132 billion in savings. which is what they are saying they get by this health care reform bill with all the tax increases and the Medicare cuts. is suspicious in the first place. given the fact that the SGR. the $200 billion is not included. the $72 billion CLASS Act. and the $47 billion that they achieve by front end loading tax increases and back end loading spending brings you to a $177 billion deficit in the first 10 years. That does not even include the funky accounting being used with regard to the Medicare trust fund. We will get into this debate about the debt limit. but nothing bears on that more heavily than what we do with health care. We need to defeat this. I hope we will still see some courage by a few of my colleagues to help us take this health care bill down. to go back to the drawing board. to do it right and to actually put in place solutions that will meaningfully reduce the cost of health care for people in this country. not increase their premiums. and not add to the deficit and saddle future generations with an enormous debt they dont deserve. Remember. $176 billion was the deficit in the month of October alone. We are talking about. under their numbers. $132 billion in savings over 10 years which. when you sit down and figure it out. it just doesnt add up.

1110040724,"Mr. President. I see -my good friend from Alabama is here as well. I wanted to give my colleagues a little sense of an update. I know we are all anxious to know how. we are progressing. While we havent had a vote this morning on any amendments. I think words of encouragement might be helpful at this juncture. to let Members know we are reaching agreement or. have reached agreement on a series of amendments that will be incorporated into either a- managers amendment or some manner or form. To give my colleagues an idea of the amendments being worked out: Senator COLLINS of Maine and my colleague from Connecticut. Senatoir LIEBERMAN. have an amendment on what is called ""stored value"" cards which we will reach an agreement on. Senator FEINSTEIN and Senator CORKER. along with Senator CASEY and Senator GRASSLEY. have an amendment on universityI believe the word is either ""affiliates"" or ""attitudes."" Anyway. it .is dealing with younger people on university campuses and credit cards. We have either reached an agreement on that or are reaching one. but one will be reached on that as well. There is the amendment from Senator LEVIN dealing with deceptive advertising. which I think we have reached agreement on as well. Senator KOHL has an amendment for a study on the marketing of credit cards. Senator FEINSTEIN and Senator GREGG have an amendment on an emergency PIN program FTC study that has also either been agreed to or is in the process of reaching an agreement. Senator AKAKA has an amendment dealing. with credit counseling standards. He has been a strong advocate of that for many years and we thank him for it. That is also an issue upon whichwe have reached some agreement. There is an amendment dealing with usury and an interest rate study which I will offer. We had a vote yesterday on at least the waiverwe didnt actually have a vote on the Sanders amendment--dealing with a cap on interest rates set to the national credit union standard. I supported the Senators effort to waive the budget point of order for us to debate that. That is not to say I would have agreed necessarily with that specific amount. but clearly there is a strong desire in the country to get our arms around this issue of exorbitant interest rates. I thought maybe we ought to be doing it. because there are different institutions with different methods of calculating that. We probably ought to take a look at how we can do that .in a more comprehensive manner. So there are a number of agreements. I see my friend from Alabama. Our staffs worked together last night late into the evening and were able to sit down with Members on both sides of the proverbial aisle. as we talk about here. to reach an understanding. While we have not had a vote this morning on any amendments. work is being done to come to final conclusion on these amendments. There are amendments that we have not reached agreement on. Let me say to my colleagues. cloture has been filed by the leader. My hope is we can finish this bill today. I have a list of 30 or 40 amendments here froni Members who wish to offer them. We have a good bill. Is it a perfect bill? No. Is it a bill that Senator SHELBY would have written on his own? No. Is it one I would have written on my own? No. But. again. we have a product that is worthy of this institutions support. It is the first time we have dealt with reform of the credit card issuing industry. At a time when our fellow constituents are being hammered by rising costs. by fees and interest rate hikes that make it harder and harder for them to keep their families together economically. it is a major step forward and it is deserving of our support. That is not to suggest that many of these amendments. are not good ideas. It doesnt mean we have finished this debate once and for all. forever. Obviously. we will be back on these issues. We are in this Congress. and we will in the next as well. We want to see how this works. We believe it will work well on behalf of our fellow citizens. But at some point we need to get moving and get this done. even though it comes short of ekeryone elses ideal goal. I say that respectfully. I have some Members with six or seven different amendments they want to offer. If that is the case. we will never finish this bill. I dont think that is in our interests. Every day we delay is a delay for the final enactment of this legislation or the imposition of its standards.. Implementation is nine months from enactment. Every day we wait pushes that date further out at a time when we can help our fellow citizens in this matter of credit card reform. I wont go back through all the provisions that are incorporated in the bill. I have done that several times. I think my colleagues are pretty well aware of what is included. This is a bipartisan bill. People didnt think we could reach this point. We have done so. Once again. Senator SHELBY and I have worked together with our staffs to achieve that. This bill has been roundly. endorsed and supported by every major consumer group in this country. That isno small achievement. So there ought to be a moment of pride here that we have put something together worthy of our support. These amendments I have mentioned already which we can adopt. we will in either a managers amendment or by some means by which they can be accepted. but then we need to take these other. remaining amendments and I need to have colleagues decide whether they are willing to have them modified or studied or whether they are willing to have their amendments not be offered at this time. They can help considerably or we run the risk of losing this bill. I wouldnt have said that a day or so ago. but we are getting precariously close to that outcome: pushing this off to next. week. We have the supplemental coming up. When the agenda is takenover by other items. it is very difficult to come back. So here we are on the cusp of actually achieving an unprecedented result and I dont want to see us lose that opportunity. I urge my colleagues to step up and come give us a hand to try and move forward on this bill.

1110070285,"Mr. President. as chairman of the subcommittee on Labor. Health and Human Services. Education and Related Agencies. I want to take a few minutes to go over the bill we have before us. the socalled ""minibus."" I wish in the beginning the Senate could have debated and voted on the LaborHHS bill individually. rather than having it as part of the socalled minibus. Unfortunately. it is now December. We still have to complete the health care bill and. frankly. we have run out of time. However. I want to assure my colleagues that the LaborHHS appropriations bill is a bipartisan bill. We worked closely with Senator COCHRAN and his staff to reflect Democratic and Republican priorities alike. That is the tradition in our subcommitteeone we take very seriously. In fact. the full Appropriations Committee approved our bill by a vote of 29 to 1. You cannot do much better than that to accommodate the concerns of both parties. I also want to assure Senators that this is a fiscally responsible bill. Overall. our bill increases discretionary spending by just 2 percent over the fiscal year 2009 LaborHHS appropriations bill. With money so tight. we had to be selective about which programs received increases. One high priority is worker protections. Agencies that enforce rules protecting the health. safety. and rights of workers have been seriously shortchanged in recent years. This bill adds $121 million over last years level and brings staffing levels at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. the Employee Benefits Administration. and the Employment Standards Administration back to where they were in 2001. This means the agencies will have the resources they need to prevent wage theft and ensure safe workplaces for our Nations workers. The bill also includes a 50percent increasea total $1.1 billionto reduce improper payments. fraud. and abuse from mandatory benefit programs. such as unemployment insurance. Medicare. and Social Security. These antifraud. antiabuse measures could result in over $48 billion in savings and increased revenues over the next 10 years. Another priority we had was getting people back to work. This bill provides an increase of $72 million. or 43 percent. for nurse training programs. including a new program to train nursing home aides and home health aides. This bill also provides a major increase-$260 millionfor the national service programs. This will boost the number of AmeriCorps members significantly and create a new social innovation fund that will help small nonprofits tackle a host of social programs. In the area of education. increases are targeted to programs that are designed to reform schools. such as performancebased pay for teachers and principals. charter schools. and a comprehensive new literacy program. Providing increases. such as the ones I have described. meant making some tough choices. Our bill eliminated 11 duplicative and ineffective programs. and we cut several others. Not everybody will be happy with all of those decisions. I may not be happy with all of them. but we did the best we could. struck compromises. and I stand by the outcome. I also support the other five bills in this minibus. if I might say that. I worked closely with our colleagues on the Appropriations Committee. I want to particularly thank Senator MURRAY regarding her work to allow fiscal year 2009 Community Development Block Grant funds to be used as a match for other Federal programs. The reason this is important is because many States and local governments were hard hit by both disasterssuch as the floods in Iowaand the poor economy. They would have great difficulty providing Federal match requirements without this modification. I thank Senator MURRAY for putting that in her bill. I also thank Senator DURBIN for the inclusion of a provision regarding auto dealers. In my State. there are a number of decisions that were made by General Motors to close down certain dealerships that met the criteria set down by General Motors for staying in business. I hope this provision that Senator DURBIN put in will allow for needed fairness for a number of these family businesses. Again. I believe the package of bills we have before us is fiscally responsible. They move our country in the right direction. and I hope the Senate will approve them as soon as possible so we can send them to the President. With that.

1110035313,I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina for her hard work on the Rules Committee. on this rule fight. and I rise in strong opposition to the rule and the underlying bill. My goodness. How long are we going to debate this? 40 minutes or an hour? This very important piece of legislation under this rule? I can understand why we only have that amount of time because. after all. were going to be working as late as 4 this afternoon here in the House. How could we possibly go just a little later than 4 to debate a very. very important piece of legislation? And then what amendments will we be debating? None. Its a closed rule. This is an atrocity. This is a very highly contentious piece of legislation. We held a 2day markup on this bill with numerous amendments in the Judiciary Committee. and it is very clear that we need a rule that will allow for amendments to be considered on the floor of the House. But we certainly dont have that. April 29.. 2009 So I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule. I would also point out that this underlying piece of legislation. which I will have the opportunity to speak more on in the general debate. is something that does. indeed. deal with thought. The only difference between beating up a senior citizen and beating up somebody who is in a protected class. under this piece of legislation. or beating up a pregnant woman. or beating up someone whos in a protected class. under this legislation. is the thought process that went into the motivation to assault that particular person. And that is legislation that is founded on criminalizing thought. It is very deeply concerning. because I. like most Americans. believe that every victim of every crime is entitled to be treated the same under the law. Why would a senior citizen not be deserving of these additional protections that are provided based upon sex or sexual orientation or race or religion? Why would pregnant women who suffer all kinds of violent crimes against them not be deserving of that same kind of protection? This legislation is bad. Vote down the rule.

1110067136,Mr. President. my colleague. Senator LANDRIEU. was going to be next. but I will switch times with her. She will join us on the floor shortly. I want to join my colleagues this morning and talk about this important issue of controlling health care costs. That is why we are here. We know Americans are facing higher and higher health care costs and that we can do something to drive down the costs of our health care system. We know health care costs are not only strangling us. but they are impacting our constituents. our budget. and they are leaving 47 million Americans without insurance. Our aim is to promote better quality care and get costs under control. Whether those costs be to consumers struggling to pay insurance premiums or to our government. we need to make sure we are doing all we can. Doing nothing in this debate is allowing health care costs to continue. I want to make sure my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who talk a lot about this legislation understand that if we do nothing. we are going to leave the American people and our budget in serious danger by not controlling health care costs. As always. in this debate we must keep in mind Federal spending. and the numbers on Federal spending are stark. In terms of doing nothing. if the U.S. Government does nothing. health care spending will double in the next decade. That is. we spend about $810 billion on health care. That is onethird of our total Federal budget. If we do nothing. Federal spending is going to go to $1.56 trillion. That is because we are not controlling health care costs. baby boomers are reaching retirement. and Medicaid and Medicare costs are ballooning. Onethird of our Federal budget is a big enough bite. But if we do nothing. then our health care priorities are going to push out other priorities of our Federal Government. The biggest area where we could control costs is in Medicare. Medicare is 57 percent of all Federal spending. and it is getting bigger. By 2020. Medicare spending alone will reach $1 trillion. doubling the $466 billion we spend today. That is to say that Medicare spending has been doubling in the last 10 years. and if we do nothing as our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are suggesting by not moving forward on this legislation. then it is going to double again. This is unsustainable because if we do not address this. Medicare is going to bankrupt us. The prospects are just as daunting when it comes to our Medicaid budget because Medicaid spending over the next several years will also double. and it has doubled in the last 10 years. States are struggling. as many of us know. with what they can do to help sustain Medicaid since they pay for part of that for individuals. So we see we are in a situation where doing nothing is an irresponsible way to go. In fact. for our constituents. they are seeing a 120percent increase in insurance premiums. While we are worried about the impact on the Federal Government. they are worried about the impact on them. on their individual budgets. That means the average family today pays about $7.000 more per year for the same health care benefits than they did a few years ago. If you think about that. that means that is less money for them. less money for their families. less money to meet the other bills in the family. Why has this happened? If we look at what has happened in our country. we see that wages have not gone up. In fact. during that same 10year period of time. wages have only gone up 29 percent. health insurance premiums have gone up 120 percent. And where has the insurance industry been? The insurance industry has seen a 428percent increase in profits over the last 10 years. That is why we need to do something about controlling health care costs. We cannot let the American people continue to be subject to such huge increases in premiums and then have the insurance industry walk away with huge profits and American consumers make less and less. What is going to happen if we do nothing. if we do not advance this bill to control health care costs? Those same premium increases we have seen in the last 10 years are also going to go up again. In fact. they are projected to go up another 7.9 percent in annual growth. That is. every year. they are going to go up another 8 percent. That is unsustainable. That means somebody is going to be paying $10.000 or more than what they are paying for their health insurance today for the same health care benefits. That is why doing nothing and not advancing this bill is just acquiescing to the fact that everybody is going to pay more for health care. What makes this number so scary is that it is four times the rate of inflation over the same period. That means what we need to do is look at general inflation. which is usually about 2 percent. But health care inflation. as is shown on this chart. is more like 8 percent. If we do nothing to change this. Americans are going to continue to do with less because health care costs are demanding more and more of their budget. What do we do about this? We certainly want to make sure that we change the system. and that is one of the reasons I support driving down costs by having a public option. We know that two factors are involved: We dont have enough competition and there are very concentrated markets in health insurance across the country. Many times there are only one or two insurance providers providing coverage in a market. They might have 94 percent of the market. It is too concentrated. We know if we provide an alternative in the marketplace. we can help drive down costs. One provision in this bill of which I am very supportive is the basic health plan because it lets States negotiate with private insurers for lower costs. In my State. this program has been in place for 20 years. It has been able to provide those who participate in the programabout 70.000 people todaya 30- to 40percent savings if they had to buy that plan as an individual from a private insurer. That is incredible success in driving down the cost. Why? I call it the Costco model because like when you go to Costco and you buy in volume. the State of Washington. buying in volume on behalf of those individuals. was able to drive down the cost of health care for those individual citizens. They were able to choose between four different plans. and they were able to get access to a very good proposal for health care for them. The underlying bill includes language that says you could provide this basic health plan if States opted into it and cover 70 percent of the currently uninsured in America. I like this proposal because it gets us cheaper insurance for that population. Why subsidize insurance companies by giving tax incentives to buy more expensive insurance when what Americans want is to drive down the cost of health care by having the same negotiating clout that big businesses or other entities have? I hope we can continue to work and maybe even expand this provision to make it even more robust and to drive down costs. What is clear is that the cost of the uninsured is adding to our health care costs. In fact. the fact there are people in America who are uninsured is adding about $1.000 to our health care premiums overall. That is about $43 billion a year to our health care system. If we can change our health care system and get more people into something such as the basic health plan. we would be able to drive down costs. and that is why that plan is so valuable. We should not forget that our current system. besides insurance reform. needs provider reform. The reason why provider reform is so important is because our current health care system is flawed. It is driving up the cost of Medicare and health care in general because of the payment system. Basically. the current payment system perpetuates more spending. In fact. there is something like $700 billion in waste in our current system. If you think about it. it is this feeforservice loop that I call it where you order more and you end up having more waste in the system. you have more spending. you have more use. and it keeps going. That is primarily because we pay doctors on volume. We pay doctors for how many patients they see every day. and we pay them for how many tests they order. Consequently. the cost continues to spin out of control. As I was saying. we spend about $700 billion on health care that we do not need to spend. That is in duplicated tests. unnecessary procedures. excessive insurance overhead. uncoordinated speciality care. and preventable hospitalization. We heard from many people during the health care debate that we have to do something to change this system. In fact. one of the witnesses before the health care committee said: We have to go after how we reimburse physicians. The current system is the most broken part of Medicare. What are we doing in this legislation to fix that? We are changing the way we reimburse for health care. In fact. we are going to look at how to get lower costs with better results. This is important because I dont think there is a person in America who doesnt know what it is like to go into a doctors office and feel they are always in a hurry or feel as if the doctor didnt hear everything you had to say. This is about changing and rewarding physicians on the outcome of your health care so you can have shorter waiting times. better access to doctors. more coordinated care. and better outcomes. We think if you change the health care system. which this bill does. to drive down costs and get better outcomes. we are going to have better health care in America. We can continue on the path which I think my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want by not voting to move forward on this legislation. we can have less coordinated care. going from specialist to specialist without having that care coordinated and have unnecessary tests. but then everybody in America is going to be paying for those costs. Everybody is going to be paying higher health care premiums because of it. What we need to do. which is what exactly this bill sets us on a course and path to do. is to pay for value not for volume. to pay physicians on the value they deliver and the outcome of their patients instead of volume. If we did nothing else in health care reform but to change our payment structure to focus on this premisepaying for value and not for volumethen we would be delivering great longterm savings to our health care system. We have other things we need to do. and that is in the area of longterm care and Medicaid because in our longterm care system. we are seeing a doubling in health care costs. primarily because of longterm care. When you think about our Medicaid budget. everybody thinks Medicaid is this program to help the lowincome population. Medicaid is turning into a longterm care program for the elderly in America. That is. they cannot get longterm care access so they are spending down so they qualify under Medicaid to basically get on that system to cover their longterm care. We can see that right now Medicaid is paying half of its funds. and that is an expense that is going to continue to grow. We have made some reforms in the State of Washington to make that cheaper. We have said lets invest in home care instead. Instead of having everybody go to nursing homes. whether they need to be there or not. lets focus on the longterm care system reforms that keep people in their community and instead use the Medicaid budget to advance other things while keeping patients at home. I think every senior in this country would rather have their health care delivered at home than in a nursing home. but our current Federal system continues to reward longterm care in nursing homes instead of in communitybased care. This legislation starts us on a path to change that direction. to move closer to longterm care community services. We did this in the State of Washington. again. over 20 years ago and have reaped huge benefits. If we took an individual in the system today. the cost is only about $22.000 per individual. If we had not reformed the system as we did 20 years ago. we would be paying $42.000 for that same individual. So we have been able to drastically cut the amount of money we are spending on longterm care. This legislation includes the same kind of cost control reforms in longterm care as some States have already implemented. That is why we have to get at controlling health care costs. If we do not control health care costs in this area of longterm care. we are not going to control health care costs overall in America. What does reform mean? Why are we here today to talk about the cost of health care and what we need to do? Why are we here talking about advancing this legislation so we can get this debate on the floor for the American people? It is clear we need to have more competition through a public option. we need smarter reimbursement rates to incentivize value. and we need better use of Medicaid dollars.,111118111,CANTWELL,MARIA,S,WA,F,D,,voting,2009-11-21,67,Ms. CANTWELL,4050,4440,11212009.txt,13035,2354,111,2009,mr presid colleagu senat landrieu go next switch time join us floor shortli

1110042777,I yield myself such time as I may consume. If were talking about things we can do to help small businesses that are not in this bill. let me add a number of. others that we have already accomplished. Id like to remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle every singleRepublican Member voted against the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. which included $15 billion of tax cuts for American small businesses. including increasing section 179 expensing limits to let small business owners fully depreciate capital purchases for items likes trucks. computers. and other equipment in the same year it was purchased. We also extended the carryback period for net operating losses. helping many small businesses in America use their losses from years past. from 2 years to 5 years. We also delayed the 3 percent withholding tax on payments to government contractors. We also provided relief for the alternative minimum tax. which hit tens of thousands of American small business owners. We also established tax credits for small businesses that hired recently discharged veterans and outofwork youth. In addition to those tax cuts. theAmerican Recovery.and Reinvestment Act also generated $21 billion in new lending and investment for small businesses. provided direct interestfree loans of $35.000. and makes loans less expensive for small business borrowers by eliminating fees that were normally built into SBAbacked loans. In the American Reco. ery and Reinvestment Act. we increased to 90 percent the amount of an SBAbacked loan that the government guarantees. making it easier for small businesses to get loans from local banks. We also unclogged the market for SBAbacked loans to help gain access to credit. to our markets. In every area of our country. small businesses continue to encounter the same difficulties. Theyre having difficulty borrowing money and face significant difficulty raising capital from equity and other sources. Until these problems are addressed. our economic recovery will be slowed. Fortunately. with this bill and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. the Congress and the President can continue to make important strides to remove these barriers to small business growth and help small business succeed in leading this recovery.

1110075783,Mr. President. as we approach the vote tomorrow morning. I know a lot of people are calling it a historic vote. In some contexts. I guess it is. However. many of us are concerned it is a historic mistake rather than a historymaking opportunity. We have had a lot of debate about whether this legislation is the right or wrong way to improve health care for all Americans. We have had hours and hours. in fact. days and weeks of committee hearings and meetings with good bipartisan discussion on options and ways to accomplish this. But now. apparently. we have a mandate by the majority demanding we have a final vote in the Senate before Christmas. While we debate this. let me say I believe we need to hear more from the people who are going to be most affected. the American people. because the final details of this bill were not crafted in front of the American public. I think most people in America know the President pledged that this legislation would be crafted around a table that is public. where. in fact. he said CSPAN cameras could be presentin his words: So people could see the deals people were making and who was working for the American people and who was cutting deals.,111119071,CRAPO,MICHAEL,S,ID,M,R,,voting,2009-12-23,345,Mr. CRAPO,16922,16956,12232009.txt,1190,215,111,2009,mr presid approach vote tomorrow morn know lot peopl call histor vote context guess howev mani us concern histor mistak rather historymak opportun lot debat whether legisl right wrong way improv health care american hour hour fact day week committe hear meet good bipartisan discuss option way accomplish appar mandat major demand final vote senat christma debat let say believ need hear peopl go affect american peopl final detail bill craft front american public think peopl america know presid pledg legisl would craft around tabl public fact said cspan camera could word peopl could see deal peopl make work american peopl cut deal,104,FALSE
1110045046,"Madam President. I needed to come to the floor and apologize for a misstatement I made yesterday on the current bill. the Kennedy tobacco bill. In yesterdays debate. I stated that the CBO. the Congressional Budget Office. report on the bill revealed that if enacted. smoking rates would decline 2 percent annually. In fact. I was wrong. I prepared a chart yesterday that showed. based .upon what CBO said. that we would reduce by 2016 the smoking rate in the country to 17.8 percent. and also the CDCs projection. which if we did nothing. we would reduce it to 15.9 percent. clearly showing the CBO estimate under the current bill we are considering would not bring the smoking rate down as much as doing nothing. The mistake I made yesterday was I assumed the way I read it that the CBO estimate is it would reduce smoking 2 percent per year. In fact. what the CBO report actually said was it would reduce by 2 percent over 10 years. So. in fact. I- have been way too generous to the current bill that it would reduce smoking to a point of 17.8 percent. which was figured based on a 2percentperyear reduction. In fact. the gap between doing nothing and passing this bill clearly is much bigger than I had anticipated. that by doing nothing. we get much more value. if the objective through passage of this legislation is to reduce the smoking rate in the United States. The bill that is being considered does not change existing products. Let me regtate that. We grandfather in all the tobacco products that are currently being marketed. What CBO has concluded is that then you have to permanently figure that about the same rate of Americans will continue to smoke because they do not have new options to turn to. Let me make this pledge to my colleagues. If the CBO report that smoking will decrease by a scant 2 percent under the bill is because of new warn.ing labels and graphic warning labels that are mandated in the bill. then let me say the substitute Senator HAGAN and I will offer provides for the same warning labels and the same graphic warning labels. If that is what gets the 2 percent reduction. over 10 years. which clearly it has to be. then I am willing to cosponsor that bill right now and substitute it for the entire Kennedy bill. so we get the full 2 percent we get in the Kennedy bill over 10 years of reductions. A simple warning label would be a tremendous improvement over this legislation787 million. a new mandate to the men and women in our military to pay for it. and it has been portrayed as an effort to reduce the usage of tobacco products with our youth. I covered for all our colleagues yesterday the fact that when you go down and look at the CDC proposals to States on part of the $280 billion of MSA payments that the industry made to Stateg. that the States had spent a pittance of what CDC projected on cessation programs to get people to stop smoking. But more alarming than the fact that States use the tobacco money to fill their budget gaps and build sidewalks rather than to fund programs to get people to stop smoking is the fact that in practically every case of 50 States. the marijuana prevalence use among youth was higher than the tobacco prevalence. Let me say that again. Marijuana usage by our youth is -projected by CDC to be higher in practically every State than what they have projected youth prevalence of tobacco use. It is actually smoking. That does not necessarily include smokeless. For my colleagues. including myself. I have spoken on the fact that we must keep tobacco out of the hands of our children. It has an age limit. I would agree it has some problems on enforcement. But marijuana is illegal. It is supposed to be enforced in every community. It is supposed to be enforced in every State. Yet more kids use it than they do tobacco products. In 1975. Congress commissioned the University of Michigan to track youth smoking rates. At that time. youth smoking was at an alltime high. However. those rates have started to come down -and leveled off around 30 percent. all the. way up to 1993. For some unknown reason at the time. youth smoking rates started to increase around 1993. peaking at close to a new alltime high in 1997. In 1998. 12th graders who said they tried cigarettes in the last 30 days was approximately 36 percent. according to the University of Michigan. Congress did nothave a good sense of why this was happening. Opponents of the tobacco industry started blaming all this on the alleged manipulation of young people by tobacco manufacturers through sophisticated marketing and advertising campaigns. I heard a Member on the floor last night of the Senate basically blaming everything on these very creative marketing techniques. Trust me. if they were that effective. every company would be figuring out how to adopt those techniques. The tobacco industry has a checkered past. at best. when it comes to marketing and adveitising. But what I am suggesting is. it may not have been all due to tobacco. There was another trend occurring in the 1993 to 1998 period that virtually mirrored that of youth smoking. and it was the increased use of illicit drugs by teenagers. Something much broader was happening among youths in our society during that time period. The Senates answer to smoking rate increases was to pass a massive FDA tobacco regulation bill. the exact bill we are debating today. Congress said nothing else would work to save our kids and bring down youth smoking rates. Senator KENNEDY made the following remarks during the 1998 Senate floor debate to emphasize the need to protect our children. I quote: FDA Commissioner David Kessler has called smoking a ""pediatric disease wilh its onset in adolescence."" In fact. studies show that over 90 percent of the current adult smokers began to smoke before they reached the age of 18. It makes sense for Congress to do what we can to discourage young Americans from starting to smoke during these critical years .... Youth smoking in America has reached epidemic proportions. According to a report issued last month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. smoking rates among high school students soared by nearly a third between 1991 and 1997. Among AfricanAmericans. the rates have soared by 80 percent. More than 36 percent of high school students smoke. a 1991 year high. . . . With youth smoking at crisis levels and still increasing we cannot rely on halfway measures. Congress must use the strongest legislative tools available to reduce smoking as rapidly as possible. Senator KENNEDY. on the Senate floor. May 19. 1998. Of course. the Senate told the American public that passage of the massive FDA tobacco regulation bill back in 1998 contained the ""strongest legislative tools available"" to address youth smoking issue. Congress did not pass the FDA bill we are debating today. What happened with youth smoking rates? They decreased since 1998 to current alltime lows. I am talking about record lows over a 34year period. In 1998. we were told by some in the Senate that youth smoking rates would not come down absent a major bureaucratic expansion over tobacco at FDA. Those Senators were wrong. dead wrong. Today. we continue the same debate over basically the same bill. and we are debating this as if nothing else has happened or changed. Obviously. something we are doing across this country is working. and it has nothing to do with what Congress is talking about doing. It has to do with the passage of the Master Settlement Agreement. advertising restrictions. awareness campaigns. and education. None of these things are enhanced in H.R. 1256. the Kennedy bill. It is about design. not about keeping kids from smoking. CBO recently stated that if it was enacted. youth smoking would reduce. over the 10year period. 2 percentexcuse me. 11 percent for youth. 2 percent overall. But according to the University of Michigan. youth smoking rates have declined by 5 percent over the last 5 years and 16 percent over the last 10 years. If this is an indication of how youth smoking rates will go over the next 10 years. we will actually slow the decline by passing this bill. Let me say that again. My colleagues do not understand. We slow the decline of youth usage by actually passing this bill. It is the University of Michigan. it is the Congressional Budget Office. all very reputable agencies. I know I have a colleague on the floor who wants to speak. I am going to yield the floor to him. But let me remind my colleagues. we are talking about a massive expansion of regulation for the FDA. not a massive expansion of regulation over tobacco. There are a host of agencies currently that regulate tobacco. It is the most regulated product in the United States of America. Now we want to centralize that regulation into the FDA. Let me read the FDAs mission statement: The FDA is responsible for protecting the public health by assuring the safety. efficacy. and security of human and veterinary drugs. biological products. medical devices. our Nations food supply. cosmetics and products that emit radiation. Just in the first phrase. protecting the public health."" you are not protecting public health when you allow cigarettes to be sold. So the fact that we have constructed a bill that grandfathers every existing product but makes it practically impossible to bring to market reducedrisk products that allow Americans to give up the cigarettes and to move to something else. the CBO was right. it will slow the reduction in smoking rates. We do nothing for disease and death. We do more for disease and death by not passing. legislation than we do by passing legislation. If the authors of this bill are. in fact. honest and the effort is to reduce youth access and youth usage. then the Members of the Senate should do nothing. Hopefully. tonight Senator HAGAN and I will offer a substitute that brings as much regulatory authority to an entity outside the Food and Drug Administration but one under the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Why? Because I spent 15 years in Washington trying to protect the integrity and the gold standard of the FDA. so that when every American goes to bed at night and they take that prescription they got from a pharmacist prescribed by a doctor. they dont have any question as to whether. one. it is safe. or. two. it is going to work. that when they go to the hospital and all of a sudden a doctor shows them a procedure they are going to have and a medical device is involved. they are not sitting wondering: Is this going to work? Is it going to hurt me? Because the FDA has already said it is safe and effective. as we bring on this new line of biological products that are going to cure terminal illnesses that are very expensive. we are not going to do it in a way that hurts our health because the FDAs gold standard is in place. that when we go to the store and we buy food. we are going to be assured it is safe. something we havent been able to do for the last few yearsspinach contamination. salmonella in peanut butter. The list goes on and on. Why. with an agency that is struggling to meet their core mission. would we ask them to take on a product. that in legislation we say we know you cannot prove it is protecting public health or it meets safety and efficacy. but on that we want you to turn your head. we want you to ignore the core mission for this new jurisdiction we are going to give you. but for everything else. we want you to apply that gold standard. we want to ensure drug safety. device safety. food safety but not with tobacco. To my colleagues. it is very simple. Read the bill. You wont vote for this bill. You want to reduce youth consumption of tobacco? It is real simple. We reduce it faster by doing nothing. Again. I think there will be a substitute that all Members can vote for tonight. It accomplishes further reductions of youth usage. because we dont constrict less harmful products in the future from coming to the market. We dont lock an adult population in to only being smokers because they are addicted to nicotine.. We give them options. such as Sweden gave their citizens. where they have reduced adult tobacco smoking at incredible rates because of innovative new products that deliver nicotine in a way that reduces the risk of disease and reduces the rate of death. If the objective here is to reduce disease. to reduce death. to reduce youth usage. then I would encourage my colleagues tonight. when Senator HAGAN and I introduce the substitute. to listen very carefully and support the substitute. But at the end of the day. if your objective is to reduce youth consumption of cigarettes. in the absence of passing that substitute. it is very clearthe CBO and the University of Michigan says: Pass nothing.

1110006385,"Madam President. the purpose of this amendment is to make sure children dont lose their private insurance and uninsured children can get access to private -health insurance. This amendment would require a premium assistance approach for new Medicaid or SCHIP expansions under this act. It would cut bureaucratic redtape for States to use a premium assistance approach. I will be the first to say SCRIP was created for targeted lowincome children. those families making less than 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. and I believe that is where the program should stay focused. The Department of Health and Human Services just released new numbers on the Federal poverty level. For a family of four. it is $22.050 a year. That means the current SCHIP without expansions is available to children whose families are making $44.000 a year. That is close to the national median income of $50.000. The underlying bill will expand the SCHIP program up to .families making $66.000 a year or $88.000 if you are fortunate enough to live in the State of New York. I am concerned about this for a number of reasons. but there is little question the majority has the votes to pass the underlying bill and President Obama will pass it. Therefore. my amendment is not about whether to expand SCHIP. my amendment is about how to expand SCHIP. Are we going to put the majority of American kids on a governmentrun program? If that is our goal. then we should totally reject this amendment. Or are we going to use an approach that ensures children in America have access to marketbased insurance? Let me tell my colleagues why this is important. Today. only 40 percent of the physicians will take an SCHIP or a Medicaid patient. Sixty percent would not even let them darken their door. So what. we have in essence done is put a stamp on the foreheads of people in these programs that says: You get the doctors who are not busy enough so they have to take SCHIP and Medicaid. What this amendment is designed to do is. if they have an opportunity for insurance. we give them that opportunity. which takes that stamp off their foreheads. In other words. we dont relegate them to lower class health care. My amendment would require States to use a premium assistance approach to keep kids in private coverage if they want to expand their Medicaid or SCHIP under this bill. The American people know the market generally does a better job of controlling costs and improving the quality than government can. We know that because when we look at outcomes of Medicare versus private insurance. we see it. When we look at outcomes of private insurance versus Medicaid. we see it. When we look at outcomes of private insurance versus SCHIP. we see it. We know that is true. If they need a little extra help to get the private insurance. this amendment would make sure they have it. I believe parentsnot government bureaucratsshould be able to make the decisions about the health care of their kids. This amendment will reduce crowdout of private insurance. Anytime the government offers to give something away for free. it is common sense that an employer or an individual will take them up on the offer. As we offer free health care to higher income children. many of whom already have coverage. we are going to see a resulting drop or crowdout in the number of employers willing to pay for private coverage. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Jonathan Gruber has estimated the crowdout rate of expanding SCHIP to new eligibility groups at 60 percent. The Congressional Budget Office shows that 400.000 children will be newly covered in higher income families. and there will be a reduction in existing private insurance for another 400.000 children. That is our own Congressional Budget Office. If we send the bill as it is written to President Obama. it is going to break one of his campaign promises when he stated last fall: If you already have insurance. the only thing that will change under my plan is that we will lower your premiums. Voting in support of this amendment ensures that President Obama can keep his promise. Not only does crowdout take away the private coverage higher income children liave now. it is a bad deal for taxpayers. For those new populations covered by CHIPRA 2009. the SCHIP legislation. one new child for the cost of two. CBO says the bill will cover 1.9 million SCHIP kids in 2013 at a cost of $2.160. However. because of crowdout. taxpayers will actually pay $4.430 for every newly insured kid because we are picking up the tab for those kids who already had insurance. The purpose of this amendment is to minimize that crowdout. Rather than encourage government dependence. it is to help people stay in a- private insurance plan. It is also cost effective because the State will only have to subsidize the employees share of the health insurance benefit rather than having taxpayers pay the entire benefit. This amendment also cuts bureaucratic redtape to make it easier for States to use a premium assistance approach. Current laws allow premium assistance. but the administrative requirements are so cumbersome that only a handful of States have premium assisted programs. J will note that the underlying bill permits premium assistance but would also note that the administrative burdens would once again discourage States from using this approach. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation. 55 percent of the 78.6 million children in America have employersponsored insurance. If that coverage is working for the majority of American kids. why cant it work for kids who are eligible for SCHIP? The answer is. it can and we have a duty to make sure it does. The premium assistance language in the underlying bill also denies parents the right to choose certain types of coverage for their children."" This language gives parents the right to choose from more coverage options. Parents. not bureaucrats. know best about what fits the needs of their children. A parent should be able to use premium assistance for their share of the employersponsored insurance. to buy insurance in the nongroup market. or to buy a consumerdirected product. All this does is give parents that right to make individual decisions about what is best for their children. about what doctor they will have for their children. Dont forget most people in SCHIP dont get a real choice about who is going to take care of their children. They have a very limited choice. What this amendment does is ensures that a large portion of them can actually choose the doctor they want for their child. It is not aboutthis amendment isnt about whether we should cover American kids. it is about the best way to cover those kids.

1110032043,Mr. President. I am joined by Senator CARPER and Senator CASEY in introducing a bill that would expand the designation of the White Clay Creek National Wild and Scenic River in Delaware and Pennsylvania to include two new sites: Lamborn Run in Delaware and the East Branch and Egypt Run in New Garden Township in Pennsylvania. In 2000. the White .Clay Creek watershed was designated Delawares first and only National Wild and Scenic River. The watershed is home to a wide variety of plant and animal life. archeological sites dating back to prehistoric times. and a biState preserve and State park. It is also a source of drinking water for the region. A National Park Service study released in 1994 details the watersheds diversity of natural. historic. cultural. and recreational resources. and its results led the way for its original designation. The watershed covers approximately 107 square miles and drains over 69.000 acres in Delaware and Pennsylvania. Of those 69.000 acres. 5.000 acres are public lands owned by State and local governments and the rest is privately owned and maintained. There are no Federal lands within the watershed and no Federal dollars were used to purchase any of the land within its boundaries. The watershed is centrally located between the densely urbanized regions of New York and Washington. DC. The legislation being introduced today will expand the designation by incorporating an additional 9 miles to White Clays National Wild and Scenic River. bringing the total federally recognized miles within the watershed to 199.9 miles. National Wild and Scenic designation brings recognition to the unique cultural. natural. scenic. and recreational values of the White Clay Creek watershed. It provides an added level of protection from overdevelopment. and it elevates the value of the watershed when applying for State. local. and Federal grants. Projects located within the White Clay Creek watershed have received almost $4 million in Federal funding since being designated in 2000. While there are over 160 National wild and scenic rivers. the White Clay Creek can claim a few distinctions. First. it is Delawares first and only wild and scenic river. It is one of only 12 rivers nationwide that is classified as a partnership river. That is a river that is managed on the local level with support from homeowners and communities and with the limited assistance of government on the local. State. and Federal level. It Was the first to be studied and designated on a watershed basis. and it is the only wild and scenic river that runs through a college or university. Thirty years ago. I was privileged to be a part of the effort that eventually designated White Clay Creek as Delawares first and only wild and scenic river. Today. I am proud to introduce legislation that will further expand and preserve this unique region. I wish to thank everyone who has worked so hard and for so long to celebrate and preserve its natural beauty. so that 30 years from now our children and grandchildren can enjoy the same pristine landscape we appreciate today. Mr. President.

1110043140,"I appreciate your passion on that subject. Gentlemen. theres one point that I always like to make on missile defense that it seems like many times people overlook it. And what I hear. just talking to people back in my district they say. well. couldnt these bad guys basically smuggle a. missile into our city and just set it off? And they dont really need a missile to do that. And the answer Is. they can try. but thats not as easy to do as it appears because the bombs and things do emit some radiation and theres some chance we could catch them. But the other main point is that a bomb set off up in the air is far. far more deadly. hundreds of times more deadly in terms of casualties than one set off on the ground. I think thats part of the reason why you see our opponents developing these ballistic and intercontinental ballistic missiles because of this high level of threat and a very rapid ability to deploy a weapon. And so thats part of the reason why this is a very key topic. And I thank you so much. The gentleman from Arizona has taken a lot of time to understand this. knows it inside and out. Hes just about like an expert. And Arizona has been doing the right thing sending you up here. And I think were going to move on to another topic which is particularly .of importance to Americans today. and thats the subject of taxation and energy. Not so long ago. our President said. under my plan of a capandtrade system. or that is capandtax system. electric rates would necessarily skyrocket. That will cost money. They will pass that money on to consumers. This is the President in a meeting in guilty January of 2008. Well. he is now the President. And theyre talking about this capandtax system thats been the subject of debate now for hours and hours in the Energy and Commerce Committee. And from what were seeing and taking a look at whats being proposed. the President was accurate in this statement. It is going to be extremely expensive. and electric rates are going to skyrocket indeed. The interesting thing about this though was he stood here at the beginning of this year and said. Im not going to tax anybody thats making less than $250.000. And yet whats being proposed here is every time you turn a light switch on. youre going to get some more taxation. How much taxation are we talking about? And whats the logic of this? Well. the logic is supposed to be that the Earth Is getting too hot. and thats really a serious problem for us. The Earth is getting too hot. And so I thought It was interesting to take a look back historically over the last hundred years. not at the temperature of the Earth. but at what the scientists have been saying do*n through the years. In 1920. the newspapers were filled with scientific warnings of a fast approaching glacial age. 1920s. 1930s. scientists reversed themselves and they said theres going to be serious global warming in the. 1930s. In 1972. Time magazine. citing numerous scientific reports that imminenjt runaway glaciation is what the Time inagazine called it. And by 1975. Newsweek. scientific evidence of an ice age. And so people were being called to stockpile food. and the question of. whether we should use nuclear weapons or some method of melting the Arctic ice cap. . 1976. U.S. government: ""The Earth is heading into some sort of miniice age."" And now weve got global warming. And so over the period of the last hundred years. wellmeaning. scientists and. supposedly majorities of scientists. even. have changed their opinion about this global warming about three times or so. Well. the complaint now is that weve got this C02 thats being generated which makes the Earth warmer and. therefore. we want to tax the CO2. When the government. wants to tax something. usually youd better hang on to your wallet. Were talking about a lot of tax. And tonight we have probably one of the most foremost experts in the House on the whole subject of this whats called capandtax.

1110012001,"I certainly thank the gentleman from Texas. Mr. Speaker. todays resolution marks the 50th anniversary of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther Kings visit to India and the positive influence that the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi had on Reverend Kings work during the Civil Rights Movement. Likewise. later this month. we will also celebrate President Lincolns birthday because of his work to lay the foundation for what would become the greatest of American achievements. the recognition of the Godgiven equal value of all individuals regardless of their race. and the consequent And natural equal protection ofthe law for everyone. Reverend King and President Lincoln had many things in common. But most prominently of all was their lifes work to humanize the dehumanized. to give value to a human life that the law had previously regarded as being lesser than other more politically powerful persons. Reverend King reminded us in his 1963 Letter From the Birmingham Jail that ""injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality. tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly. affects all indirectly."" Like Gandhi. Reverend King looked to his faith to transform society. Reverend King ultimately paid with his life the price for working to extend the equal protection of the law to all. Mr. Speaker. those were the struggles of the past centuries. And those were the heroes of the past centuries. But their work is not done. The 21st century has its own civil rights struggle. Mr. Speaker. As Day Gardner. president of the National Black ProLife Union. has said. ""The biggest struggle for civil rights today is for the civil rights of the unborn child.""

1110047229,Madam President. it is a distinct honor and privilege for me to stand on the floor of the Senate to pay tribute to a gentleman I went to college with. a gentleman who has reported on politics and government in Georgia for the better part of the last 35 years. a gentleman who recently announced his retirement at the end of this month from the associate editorial page responsibilities at the Atlanta Journal and Constitution. Mr. Jim Wooten. born and raised in McRae. GA. veteran of Vietnam. 20 years in the Georgia Air National Guard. former President of the Georgia Press Association. lifetime trustee of the Georgia Press Associations educational fund. has made a tremendous contribution to our State and to the public lives of all our people. I rise to pay tribute to him. One of the greatest tributes of all that I can share is what happened on Monday. at lunch this week. I had -a luncheon with the Board of Cox Enterprises. The Cox newspapers own the Atlanta Constitution. as they do the Palm Beach Post and the Dayton paper. They own many other businesses. It is a huge privately held company. At that luncheon. unsolicited by me. the name of Jim Wooten came up and. one by one. the leaders of Cox Enterprises talked about the tremendous contributions that Jim Wooten has made to their newspaper. As one who was first elected in 1976 and has been written about many times by Jim Wooten. I wanted to add my tribute to his journalistic talent and the contribution he has made. I am not sure I know of any other writer I have read who has reported on what is going on in politics in our State. who has gotten it right more oftenin fact alwaysthan Jim Wooten. Conservative? Yes. he is conservative. But he -is pragmatic. When he writes his opinions on the editorial page of the Atlanta Constitution. it makes a difference in the minds and attitudes of Georgias people. I say job well done to Jim Wooten. I hope his retirement is successful andrewarding in every way he wishes it to be. and I thank him very much for all the contributions he has. made to the lives of all Georgians and. in one case. to this Georgian.

1110007776,Thank you very much. Mr. President. Mr. President. I respectfully strongly disagree with the distinguished Senator. In my 16 years on the Judiciary Committee. I have never seen a more qualified nominee. Mr. Holder has been a prosecutor in the Public Integrity Section of the Department of Justice. a Superior Court judge for the District of Columbia. the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. an attorney in private practice. and the Deputy Attorney General of the United States. the No. 2 position in the -Department. I do not think you can beat these credentials. Now. people find one two decisions out of a multiplicity of decisions Mr. Holder has made with which they disagreeand they are welcome to disagreebut that does not destroy his value or his worth as Attorney General. President Reagan first appointed Holder to be a Superior Court judge. and President Clinton then named him U.S. attorney and Deputy Attorney General. On all three occasions. he was unanimously confirmed by the Senate. Today. his nomination is being broadly supported by Members of both parties. We have received letters from people such as the former FBI Director. Louis Freeh. former Deputy Attorneys General Jim Comey. Paul McNulty. and Larry Thompson. former Solicitor General and Republican Ted Olsen. and President George H.W. Bijshs Attorney General. William Barr. Virtually every single law enforcement agency in the country has come out to endorse him: the Fraternal Order of Police. the National Associatibn of Attorneys General. the Attorneys General of over 30 States. the National Criminal Justice Association. and on and on. He has unified support among the civil rights community: the NAACP. the AsianAmerican Justice Center. the MexicanAmerican Legal Defense and Educational Fund. and the Human Rights Campaign. It is rare to see such bipartisan support for a candidate. In Mr. Holders case. I believe it is very well deserved. He is a man of integrity. intelligence. humility. and heart. I remember our prior Attorney General. Mr. Gonzales. making the statement that he wore two hats. At the time he said it. I did not realize what the implication was. He stated. and on the record. that he represented the President of the United States and he represented the people of this Nation. Well. we saw in spades what a doublehatted Attorney General can do. We saw the politicization of that Department. We saw the top people in the Department acting politically with appointments. We saw the diminution of the Civil Rights Division. We saw at least 9 U.S. attorneys terminated because the administration did not agree with the decision they either refused to make or made. That is not the way the Attorney General should run what is a very large Department. This is a $25 billion agency. It has over 100.000 employees. Itis charged with fighting terrorism. stopping violent crime. upholding our civil rights laws. and enforcing our civil liberties. As those of us on the Judiciary Committee know well. the Department is badly in need of repair. In January of 2007as a matter of fact. I remember it wellI came to the floor. and I said someone. a Republican. had called me and said that on a given day in December. seven U.S. attorneys had been fired. Well. I checked. and in fact that was correct. On December 7. seven U.S. attorneys had been fired. What he also told me: It was all for the wrong reasons. And he said: Look into it. Under the leadership of the chairman of the committee. PAT LEAHY. we did look into it. What we found was a trend in the middle of the term to essentially take certain U.S. attorneys and terminate them for one reason or another: some. I believe. because they would not bring a certain prosecution and some. I believe to this day. because they did bring a certain prosecution. Last year. Inspector General Glenn Fine released four separate reports documenting violations of civil service laws and politicized hiring throughout the Department. Well. there is a big job to do. and it is going to be Mr. Holders duty to turn this Department around. to restore its credibility. This is a proud Department. and I believe Mr. Holder gave every one of us on the committee confidence last month when he stated this: [T]he notion that the Justice Department would ever take into account a persons political affiliation or political beliefs in making [career] hiring decisions is antithetical to everything that the Department stands for. Now. that is a substantial commitment. and those of us on the Judiciary Committee will be watching him carry it out. So I am delighted this new Attorney GeneralI believe will be confirmed at 6:15 tonightwill restore the integrity and the professionalism of this great Department. In my view. despite differences on certain judgments. there is no oneno onemore qualified to become Attorney General of the United States than Eric Holder. and I will proudly cast my vote for him.

1110026710,"Mr. Speaker. Dr. John Hope Franklin was one of the most important Americans of the 20th century. He was a citizen of the world. a towering intellectual giant and scholar who ceaselessly endeavored. as one of the preeminent historians in our nations history. to ensure that the contributions of AfricanAmericans would not be relegated to the status of a footnote. Rather. through dedicated scholarship. he brought to light the rich contributions AfricanAmericans have made to the United States of America. As he once said so eloquently. ""My challenge was to weave into the fabric of American history enough of the presence of blacks so that the story of the United States could be told adequately and fairly."" He understood intimately that the story of the greatest country on earth. the United States of America cannot be told without telling the story of AfricanAmerican history and that in fact. they are one and the same. Dr. John Hope Franklin was considered the Dean of African American historians. John Hope Franklin was born on January 2. 1915 in Rentriesville. Oklahoma. His family relocated to Tulsa. Oklahoma shortly after the Tulsa Disaster of 1921. Franklins mother. Mollie. was a teacher and his father. B.C. Franklin. was an attorney who handled lawsuits precipitated by the famous Tulsa Race Riot. Graduating from Booker T. Washington High School in 1931.

It is a very special honor and privilege for me to rise to urge support for a resolution honoring a personal friend of mine. the head womens basketball coach. at my alma mater. the University of Tennessee. and that is our great coach. Pat Head Summitt. The gentleman from New York has very succinctly outlined many of the accomplishments and honors that Coach Summitt has received in her career. but I would like to reiterate some of these things. It is really a phenomenal record that she has. Coach Summitt has coached for more than 35 years. all with the Lady Vols. Her overall record is 1.005 wins and 192 losses for a winning percentage of better than 84 percent. Coach Summitt and theLady Vols have won 27 Southeastern Conference titles. Coach Summitt and the Lady Vols have won eight NCAA championships. She has been named the NCAA Coach of the Year seven times and SEC Coach of -the Year seven times. Coach Summitt also coached the U.S.A. womens basketball team.to the Olympic Gold Medal in the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. She is the author of two books. ""Reach for the Summitt"" and ""Raise the Roof."" Theyare both very inspiring books. In 1999. Coach Summitt was inducted into the Womens Basketball Hall of Fame. and in 2000 she was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield. Massachusetts. becoming only the fourth womens basketball coach to receive that distinction. Also in 2000. she was named the Naismithl Coach of the Century. On February 2. 2007. Wheaties unveiled a Breakfast of Champions box in her honor. making her the first womens basketball coach to be honored on such a box. Coach Summitt has two streets named in her honor: Pat Head Summitt Street on -the University of TennesseeKnoxville campus. and Pat Head Summitt Avenue on the University of TennesseeMartin campus. Coach Summitt also has a remarkable 100 percent graduation rate. as the gentleman from New York mentioned. with every studentathlete who has completed their eligibility at UT either graduating or working toward all of the requirements for graduation within the NCAAallotted time of 6 -years. I dont think there is any other coach. men or womens coach. in this country that can say that. And I will tell -you that she also insists on her students taking tough courses that lead to good careers. And we often read in the Knoxville newspapers about the great success of many of her graduates. Pat Head Summitt is simply an outstanding woman and an outstanding individual in every way. both personally and professionally. And it.is a great honor for me to stand here before you today to bring this r.esolution to the floor honoring Coach Pat Head Summitt and the Lady Vols and congratulating her on achieving that tremendous. just almost unbelievable mark of 1.000 victories.

1110032197,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. As a member of the House Administration Committee. I am pleased to support the appointment of David Rubenstein to be a citizen regent of the Smithsonian . Institution. Committee members recently had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Rubenstein. cofounder of the Carlyle Group. and we discussed the heightened expectations and increased responsibilities of the board as it continues to tackle the challenges faced by the institution. Currently. the Smithsonian Institution is comprised of 19 museums that hosted over 25 million visitors last year. roughly five times the number of visitors that came to the U.S. Capitol. In addition to current facilities. the institution is slated to break ground on the National Museum of African American History and Culture in 2012. a project estimated to cost $500 million. And just last year. the President signed the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008. which established a commission to study the creation of a national museum dedicated to the art. culture. and history of the Latino community in the United States. The Smithsonian. like every other growing complex organization. faces unique operational challenges. Yet the institutions core mission. first articulated by James Smithson in 1826. to be ""an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge"" still stands the test of time. Through his philanthropy. Mr. Rubenstein has already demonstrated a commitment to James Smithsons original vision. When the last privately owned copy of the Magna Carta became available for purchase. Mr. Rubenstein bought this priceless artifact and then permanently lent it back to the National Archives.

1110021703,Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of House Resolution 211. a bill to support the goals and ideals of National Womens History Month. I would like to send a tribute out to all of the women trailblazers who have contributed so much to our country. And I think St. Patricks Day is the perfect time to remember them! I would like to begin by sending a very special .thank you to former Congresswoman Pat Schroeder of Colorado. Congresswoman Carrie Meek of Florida. and Congresswoman Barbara. Kennelly of Connecticut. and to some of the women Members who I had the honor to serve with in this body and recently passed: The Honorable Stephanie TubbsJones of Ohio. The Honorable Julia Carson of Indiana. and the Honorable Juanita MillenderMcDonaid of California. I would also like to discuss a few of the women who served as mentors to me over the years. I remember growing up in Jacksonville. back in the civil rights era in the United States. And I knew I wanted to do somethingget involved in something bigto make a difference. And I was inspired by a strong willed woman. Ms. Gwendelyn Sawyer Cherry. who would stop at nothing to change the terrible ills that our society. and in particular. African Americans. were facing in that time period. Ms. Sawyer Cherry was the first AfricanAmerican woman to practice law in Dade County. Florida. and became one of the first nine attorneys who initially served at Legal Services in Greater Miami in 1966. She was elected as a state representative in 1970. becoming the first AfricanAmerican woman to serve as a legislator for the State of Florida. She was elected to four terms and served until During her term. she introduced the Equal Rights Amendment in Florida. chaired the State of Floridas committee for International Womans Year in 1978. and coauthored Portraits in Color. I thank you. Ms. Sawyer Cherry. for all you have done for our nation and for the state of Florida. And the last woman I would like to mention is a very near and dear friend of mine. an African American woman who served with me both in the Florida state legislature and came up to Washington with me in 1993. I am referring to. of course. Ms. Carrie Meek of Miami. The granddaughter of a slave and the daughter of former sharecroppers. she spent her childhood in segregated Tallahassee. She then went on to graduate from Florida A&M University in 1946. at a time when African Americans could not attend graduate school in Florida. so she was forced to travel North to continue her studies and ended up graduating from the University of Michigan. Ms. Meek went on to become a Florida state representative in 1979. and was the first African American female elected to the Florida State Senate in 1982. As a state senator. Meek served on the Education Appropriations Subcommittee. and her efforts in the Legislature also led to the construction of thousands of affordable rental housing units. In 1992. Congresswoman Carrie Meek was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Floridas 17th Congressional District. This made Ms. Meek. along with myself and Congressman ALCEE HASTINGS. to serve as the first black lawmakers elected to represent Florida in Congress since Reconstruction. Upon taking office. Ms. Meek was faced the extreme task of helping her district recover from Hurricane Andrews devastation. and her efforts helped to provide $100 million in federal assistance to rebuild Dade County. As a powerful and hard working Member of the appropriations committee. Congresswoman Meek became a leader on issues from economic development. to health care funding. to education and housing. She also passed legislation to improve Dade Countys transit system. their airport and seaport. construct a new family and childcare center in North Dade County. and fund advanced aviation training programs at MiamiDade Community College. In recent times. the Honorable Carrie Meek has worked to become a civil rights advocate for senior citizens in the Miami area. as well for the Haitian community in South Florida. In closing.

1110065506,ida. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker. the bill before us creates 111 different offices. bureaus. commissions. programs and entitlements. but it only cuts oneMedicare. This bill steals more than $500 billion from our Nations seniors to fund new entitlement programs for the young. the healthy and the wealthy. My colleagues in the majority have boldly decided that cutting $500 billion from Medicare is a good idea. They actually are telling seniors that these cuts will improve Medicare in the future. Well. Grandpa and Grandma might be old. but they are not stupid. You are not going to cut Medicare and tell them that its a good thing. The bottom line is that this bill is not real reform. Congress should be strengthening Medicare. not weakening the program. Just look at how bad the Federal Government has been historically in predicting health care costs. This bill will increase health care costs for all Americans and cut Medicare funding. Americans dont believe that yet another trilliondollar program will cost them nothing. Mr. Speaker. we all hear Speaker PELOSI say that she is a mother and a grandmother. Like Speaker PELOSI. I too am a mother and a grandmother. I can tell you that my constituents believe that this bill is bad for the middle class. bad for parents and grandparents and. even worse. for future generations. I cannot support this bill. I urge my colleagues to reject it as well so that we can work together truly on a bipartisan solution. The Presidents own economic advisors have said that this bill will kill 5.5 million jobs. Americans back home are watching this and saying. What is Congress thinking? Why would they want to further sabotage our economy? This bill clearly is not what America wants.

1110062968,"The story of Helen Keller has inspired generations of Americans. It is especially meaningful for those of us from Alabama because Helen Keller is one of our own. Her statue will vividly remind us of a young girl from the rural south and how she overcame tremendous challenges to become a symbol of hope and determination for people throughout the world. As my colleague. Mr. LUNGREN. described. Helen was not even 2 years old when illness left her unable to see or hear. That would be difficult enough for a child and for a father and mother to deal with today with all our advantages. Imagine how devastating it must have been for a family in the Deep South during the 1880s. Some might have mistakenly assumed that Helen or a child who is blind and deaf may not aspire to do anything more than be cared for with compassion. But such is certainly not the normal mindset of children with physical limitations as many of us know. They have the same aspirations and hopes and dreams as their fellow children. It certainly was not the case for Helen. Helens parents also refused to accept limits on their child or on her life. just as Helen. When she grew older. they refused to be limited by her disabilities. They had a deep and strong faith that their daughter could be educated and live a full and rich life. And while Helen could not yet express that she had the same determination. ultimately this would bring them in contact with Anne Sullivan and lead to the scene which is depicted by the new statue: that miraculous moment when Helen Keller. with water running over her hands. finally understood what a word meant and that word was ""water."" Very few statues can tell such a moving story. This one does. But. of course. it is only the beginning of the story of Helen Keller and what she chose to use her life for. and that was to help others. As an educator. as an advocate. as a humanitarian. she showed there is no obstacle that cannot be overcome. Her life reminds us to cherish every member of our society because each person has unique gifts and blessings from God. The statue will be very popular. especially with children. It conveys the important message that whatever lifes challenges. nothing should ever hold us back. We live in a country where you can overcome any obstacle and achieve your dreams if you work hard and possess the desire to succeed. There were many people involved with this project that the Alabama delegation wishes to acknowledge. My colleague. PARKER GRIFFITH. has mentioned Governor Bob Riley and his wife Patsy. They were two of the guiding forces behind the statue that is such a great gift from the people of Alabama to the people of our Nation. Governor. I hope you and the First Lady look upon this as one of your proudest legacies. Dr. Joe Busta from the University of South Alabama. who was cochair of the Helen Keller Campaign. and his cochair Elmer Harris. former CEO of Alabama Power. Dr. Bob Morris and his team at the Helen Keller Foundation. Dr. Morris devotes weeks of each year to restoring sight of children who have lost their sight and is actually a miracle worker today giving the gift of sight. Dr. Terry Graham. president of the Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind. and Lynne Hanner from the Institute. Among the members who served on the Helen Keller Campaign and the Artist Selection Committee. the Alabama delegation is honored to have three members of the Keller family: great nephew Bill Johnson. great nephew Warren Johnson. and great grand niece Keller Johnson Thompson. And. of course. finally we recognize the outstanding work of the artist. Edward Hlavka. We all look forward to the formal unveiling of the Helen Keller statue next Wednesday.

1110059958,"Mr. President. I rise today to bring to my colleagues attention a new report by Human Rights Watch entitled ""Burmas Forgotten Prisoners."" The report offers moving and compelling stories of political activists in Burma who have put their lives and careers on the line to raise awareness about the human rights situation in their country. In the face of threats. intimidation and beatings. they have embraced nonviolence to put pressure on the ruling military junta to respect the legitimate aspirations of the people of Burma and support a new government based on democracy. human rights. and the rule of law. We all have been inspired by the story of Burmas most famous political prisoner. Nobel Peace Prize winner and leader of the democratic opposition. Aung San Suu Kyi. After leading the National League for Democracy to an overwhelming win in the 1990 parliamentary electiona victory quickly annulled by the military juntashe has spent the better part of the past 19 years in prison or under house arrest. Recently. a Burmese court sentenced her to an additional 3 years of confinement on trumped up charges of violating the terms of her house arrest. Yet despite the regimes best efforts. it has failed to stifle her will and her call for free and democratic Burma. And it has failed to stop her from inspiring thousands of her fellow citizens to take up her cause. The report by Human Rights Watch reminds us that while Suu Kyi is the most wellknown democracy activist. she is by no means alone. In fact. the report notes that there are now more than 2.100 political prisoners in Burma. there are 43 prisons holding political activists in Burma and 50 labor camps. and beginning in late 2008. closed Burmese courts sentenced more than 300 activists to prison terms of. in some cases. more than 100 years for speaking out against the government and forming organizations. Among those profiled are Zargana. one of Burmas most famous comedians. actors. and human rights activists. who was arrested and sentenced to 59 years in prison for criticizing the governments response to Cyclone Nargis.

1110070181,Mr. President. over the past several months. I have come to the floor of this body many times to speak about the urgent need for comprehensive health care reform. I have said that our bill must accomplish three goals in order to be effective: It must bring competition to the insurance marketcompetition to the insurance marketit must provide significant cost savings to ordinary Americans. and it must restore accountability to an industry that has run roughshod over the American public for far too long. I would like to focus on this last point with my remarks today. We need real accountability in the insurance market. After almost 100 years of debate about health care reform. this Senate stands on the verge of making history. There are many good elements in the legislation that is before us today. but without accountability. any reform measure would be toothless and inconsequential. If we dont give the American people a chance to hold their insurance providers accountable. quality care will continue to elude certain segments of our population. We cant stand for this any longer. We must prevent insurance companies from discriminating against people by charging them higher rates or denying coverage because of certain conditions. Everyone knows it is hard for uninsured patients to get quality medical care. Under the current law. in the case of catastrophic injury or illness. anyone admitted to the emergency room should receive equal treatment to save their life. Shockingly. Harvard researchers have found that this is not the case. They examined 690.000 individual cases over 4 years and found that uninsured patients are nearly twice as likely to die in the hospital as patients with similar injuries who do have insurance. And even after these results were adjusted to account for age. race. gender. and the severity of the injuries. they found that the uninsured were still 80 percent more likely to die than those with health coverage. including Medicaid. I just had a delegation of physicians in my office. I listened to their comments in reference to wanting us to make sure we passed a health care reform bill this session. One of those physicians began to relate to me the story of his brother. who was employed but was without health insurance. At 41 years old. he died of cancer because he waited too long to try to get treatment. And because he was uninsured and no one would treat him. that took his life at the young. tender age of 41. So this new evidence is conclusive. and it is truly disturbing. The poor and the uninsured suffer disproportionately under our current system. In the most advanced country on Earth. there is no excuse for this stunning inequality. Big corporations know there is a lot of money to be made out of the poor and they do not hesitate to rake in large profits and their expenses. These companies exploit minor technicalities to deny coverage to people who are sick. They use gaping holes in the system to refuse treatment for those with certain conditions. That is because they do not see patients as real people who need help. they see them as numbers in the corporate ledger. They see risk and expenses and lower dividends for their shareholders. That is why we need to prioritize patients over profits. That is why we need to extend coverage to more people and make these companies accountable for the first time in decades. If we pass insurance reform with a strong public option it would be illegal to deny coverage because of a preexisting condition. For the first time in many years. ordinary Americans would be able to shop around if they are paying too much. or they are not being treated fairly. Costs would come down. coverage would improve. and lives would be saved. Let us pledge ourselves to this cause. Let us make sure every American can get the treatment they need in the emergency room regardless of their income. need. or the insurance coverage they have. We must not fall short in this regard. We must not settle for anything less.

We have seen whooping cranes in Texas. I am glad they are protected. they are beautiful.

1110069144,"Reclaiming my time. and there is the point. We have this 1.300page bill that I would hazard the great guess that the vast majority of this body here tonight has not ever had the opportunity to. nor the inclination to. nor. in fact. did read. And now we seem to hear that when it comes to what the impact. the vast impact that this will have on our economy. where is there information as to what they inquired that it would do? It is absent. I spoke before about the point that this bill goes contrary to the American publics claim that they do not want any more bailouts. and I raised reference to one section of the bill which in perpetuity it allows for the creation of switching from receivership into bankruptcy and makes it basically a political decision. Another provision of the bill on page 408 basically says that the Treasury Secretary has unlimited authority to borrow an unlimited amount of money from the Federal Treasury. which means from the American taxpayer. How do we see this? Page 408 of the bill. section 3. ""Borrowing authority when fund assets are less than $150 billion."" Section (B). ""The corporation may borrow. and the Secretary may lend. any amount of funds that. when added to the amount available in the fund on the date the corporation makes a request to borrow funds. would not exceed $150 billion."" What does that mean? That means today. as we start this program out. there are zero dollars in the fund. The Treasury Secretary can go to the Treasury. meaning the American taxpayer. and ask for $150 billion from the American public. and they could bail out some company. maybe AIG again. as this past administration helped facilitate. And then after that. theres no money in the fund again. so they go back to Treasury and say. We need another $150 billion. because. under the terms of the bill as written right now. theres no money in the fund and they can borrow up to $150 billion. They ask for another $150 billion. And then a company akin to Lehman or something goes under. or another company over here or the auto companies go under. and they pay it all out the next day. How much is in the fund then? Zero. At which point the Treasury Secretary can go back to the American taxpayer a third time and ask for an additional $150 billion. When does it end? This bill puts absolutely no limit on it whatsoever. It could be $150 billion. It can be $1 trillion. It could be $10 trillion. Its all in the hands of the political appointee. Secretary Geithner. for him to decide where this money goes and how much it goes to. and it can be a political decision because. as we have seen before. he can prop up favorite companies and allow them then to go into receivership and then allow them to come back out of it after he has asked the American public to spend $10 billion. $100 billion. $1 trillion in order to do so. Where is the limitation in this bill? There is absolutely none. So when the other side of the aisle looks chagrined when we say the American taxpayer is on the hook for bailouts. they need only to look at their own bill. page 408 or page 3 over here in the Judiciary Committee. to see that is an unlimited drain on the American taxpayer. that this will allow perpetual bailouts that are never ending and will be made by political appointees for their favorite companies that they want to prop up to the end of the Earth. That. I think. is reason one why we should be opposed to this bill. If theres nothing else in this bill besides those few pages. we should all be voting ""no."" If theres nothing else in this bill. every American listening to this floor debate tonight should be calling up their Member of Congress and saying. Why are you putting us on the hook to bail out bad businesses and bad business decisions? Why are you putting us on the hook to bail out your political favorite companies that you want to bail out. and why do you want to do so without limitation?",111119510,GARRETT,SCOTT,H,NJ,M,R,5,voting,2009-12-09,394,Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey,18995,19123,12092009.txt,3925,722,111,2009,reclaim time point page bill would hazard great guess vast major bodi tonight ever opportun inclin fact read seem hear come impact vast impact economi inform inquir would absent spoke point bill goe contrari american public claim want bailout rais refer one section bill perpetu allow creation switch receivership bankruptci make basic polit decis anoth provis bill page basic say treasuri secretari unlimit author borrow unlimit amount money feder treasuri mean american taxpay see page bill section borrow author fund asset less billion section corpor may borrow secretari may lend amount fund ad amount avail fund date corpor make request borrow fund would exceed billion mean mean today start program zero dollar fund treasuri secretari go treasuri mean american taxpay ask billion american public could bail compani mayb aig past administr help facilit there money fund go back treasuri say need anoth billion term bill written right there money fund borrow billion ask anoth billion compani akin lehman someth goe anoth compani auto compani go pay next day much fund zero point treasuri secretari go back american taxpay third time ask addit billion end bill put absolut limit whatsoev could billion trillion could trillion hand polit appointe secretari geithner decid money goe much goe polit decis seen prop favorit compani allow go receivership allow come back ask american public spend billion billion trillion order limit bill absolut none side aisl look chagrin say american taxpay hook bailout need look bill page page judiciari committe see unlimit drain american taxpay allow perpetu bailout never end made polit appointe favorit compani want prop end earth think reason one oppos bill there noth els bill besid page vote there noth els bill everi american listen floor debat tonight call member congress say put us hook bail bad busi bad busi decis put us hook bail polit favorit compani want bail want without limit,311,FALSE

Right now a group of moderate Senators is meeting behind closed doors to try to hash out a compromise on the public option.

C SPAN this is not. I would remind my colleagues that the amendment we are discussing here is drafted to prevent drastic Medicare Advantage cuts from impacting all seniors in Medicare Advantage.

""I am offering an amendment to shield seniors from those benefit cuts."" He is offering an amendment to shield senior citizens. Well. I am offering a motion that deals with all of the 11 million seniors who are under Medicare Advantage. as the Senator from Florida said. to shield seniors from benefit cuts.

1110029943,"said. Well. I was chairman of the committee when the collapse came. do I take any responsibility? No. not for that. because I tried to work with Mr. Oxley in 2005 to pass a bill over what he calfed the Bush ideologues who blocked him. And in 2007. I became chairman of the committee on January 31. On March 28. the committee passed a bill that improved the regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in a way that was tougher than the Oxley bill of 2005. In fact. the Bush administration that thought that the Oxley bill was too weak approved our bill. They said it was the right way to do it. It was the right form of regulation. In fact. Richard Baker. who unlike many of the Republicans who now are full of fight. was a leader in an effort to restrain Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. was quoted at the time as saying Mr. Baker had been the leader in this and heres what he had to say. talking about the bill. Heres a quote from Politico: BARNEY FRANK had witnessed Bakers battles as ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee. When he became chairman this year. he moved swiftly and pushed the bill through the Chamber in May with a 314104 vote. The Frank legislation is significantly tougher than the one Fannie and Freddie fought so bitterly in 2000. an irony that pleases Baker. And the gentleman. our former colleague says. With every iterationit. the bill I sponsoredit got stronger. Its to the point where I didnt know what else there was to put in it. And then theres a group called FM Focus. They were formed to be a critical block that sought regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Heres what they said in Congressional Quarterly. The chief lobbyist was asked. were any other Democrats helpful? Here it is. EJ 2130 Heres what the chief lobbyist for the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac group said: ""The Senate Banking Committee passed a very good bill in 2004."" It never got to the Senate -floor. That was under the Republicans. There I go again stopping the Senate Republicans from bringing their own bill to the floor. The Senate Republicans had a bill. Never came to the floor of the Senate when I was in the Democratic minority in the House. Then the House introduced a bill. which it passed. but we couldnt get it to the floor of the Senate. ""Then. after the 2006 election. when everyone thought FM policy focus issues would be tough sledding with Democrats in the majority. Barney Frank as the new chairman of the House Financial Services Committee stepped up and said. Im convinced we need to do something. He sat down with Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and. frankly. upset people in the Senate and Republicans in the House."" B cause they wanted an issue to complain about. They didnt want to see a solution. ""They came up with a bill that was excellentand it was the .bill that largely becomes law. and they were able to be phased out."" So let me just summarize on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Republicans do nothing to pass a bill in their 12 years in power. 2003. Mike Oxley tries to pass one. The Bush administration called it off by pressuring him. 2005. he gets one passed in the House. The Bush administration denounces. he denounces them. and the Senate doesnt pass it. 2007. when I became chairman. we passed it. So I dont think I apologize for this. Unfortunately. Senate deadlock again occurred this time with the Democrats in a 2vote majority. but it has a happier ending because the Democrats in the Senate ultimately did pass the bill. In January of 2008. worried that the Bush policy of pushing them into too many subprime loans. which I document starting in 2004. I appealed to Secretary Paulson. who will acknowledge this. when we did the economic stimulus bill. and said. please. would you put the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac regulatory bill which you like into the stimulus. It also had an affordable housing trust fund. So the right wing didnt like it. They didnt like the idea of helping build affordable rental housing. But building affordable rental housing avoided the problem of bad subprime mortgages. That was the solution I always worked for. And Mr. Paulson basically said. Id like to do it. but Ive got conservatives here who wont let me. So we could have had that in the stimulus in 2008. It didnt finally pass until July of 2008. By that time. it was too late to avoid the disaster with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But if I had been successful. we would have passed it in 2005.- myself. working as a junior member of a coalition with Mike Oxley. We would have passed it in 2007 if the Senate had been able to do it. So thats the story of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. So it is the Republicans fault because they ran the House and the Senate and the Presidency that we didnt get passage of a Fannie MaeFreddie Mac bill until the Democrats came back to power. Its indisputable. Republican President. Republican House. Republican Senate. No bill. Democrats take over. We get a bill through the House in 1 year. Unfortunately. a year later we have to wait before we get it through the Senate. But when my Republican friends think about it. I dont want them to feel too badon this issuebecause while they were clearly the ones who were responsible for no regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. I dont think It had as much negative impact as they think. I think the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac collapse was as much an effect as a cause of the subprime crisis. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac did not originate mortgages. Thats not their goal. *They bought mortgages made by other people. If people hadnt made those bad mortgages in the first place. there wouldnt have been any. So were a lot of others in the private sector. And thats where the real blame lies. Blame lies with Republican i5olicies that resisted our efforts to restrict inappropriate subprime loans. This is the crux of it. Bad subprime loans were the. root of thisand there could not be a clear partisan divide on the issue. Again. I would urge people to read Mark Zandis book. In 1994. the last time the Democrats had a majority before 2007. my predecessor. an excellent consumer fighter from the State of New York. helped pass a bill called HOEPA. Home Ownership Equity Protection Act. It said to the Federal Reserve: Regulate subprime loans. Remember. the problem I mentioned before is that we got a new form of lending that went outside the banks and went to the mortgage finance companies and they werent regulated. So the Democratic Congress said: Mr. Greenspan. regulate them. Mr. Greenspan said explicitly: No. In fact. Mr. Zandi. a man whos been an advisor to John McCain. headlines on page 152 of his book on the Financial Shock. a subchapter headlined: Greenspans Regulatory Failure. Mr. Greenspan acknowledges much before the Government Reform Committee this year. By the way. another one of those who has said that we were secretly behind this. who was a member of the Republican Party and did nothing in the House to stop this was the gentleman from California. Mr. ISSA. He was a member of the Government Reform Committee for many of these years. They did nothing about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac until Mr. WAXMAN took over and got into it during the first Congress among Democrats. But Mr. Greenspan refused to do that in 1994. Many pressed him to do it. He refused. In 2004. when the Bush administration began pushing harder for subprime loans. many of us became concerned. Heres what Mr. Zandi says again. ""A group in North Carolina was particularly concerned about that."" the Committee for Resporisible Lending. ""working with two of their very effective and thoughtful members ""-members of our Financial Services Committee.- Mr. WATr and Mr. MILLER-""they sought to get legislation enacted that would prevent this sort of abuse."" We began conversations. I was then the senior Democrat still on the committee. The Republican chair of the committee that had jurisdiction on Housing was the gentleman from Alabama. Mr. BACHUS. now the ranking member. the minority member. And I will do him a favorI will not impute to him the secret powers imputed to me. I dont blame Mr. BACHUS for what we do or dont do. Were the majority and we will take the responsibility. Its the Republicans who wont take the responsibility for their zero batting average for 12 years when we were in the minority. But we sought. as Mr. Zandi documents. to pass legislation to restrict subprime lending. Alan Greenspan would use his authority. so we tried to do it. And the problem is that the Republican philosophy that ruled of no regulation knocked it out of the box. I think Mr. BACHUS was serious. Mr. DeLay was even more serious. He didnt want it. We were in negotiations. Now the gentleman from Alabama was chair of the subcommittee. He could have. any time. called a markup. brought a bill out. We thought his bill would have been strong enough. He could have outvoted us. Republicans often did that when they were in the majority. as we often do today. But here is what Mr. Zandi said: ""Democrats in Congress were worried about increasing evidence of predatory lending. The Bush administration and most Democrats wanted a Federal equivalent to the North Carolina law to cover all lenders. not just the banks. The Bush administration and most Republicans in Congress."" who were in the majority. ""were opposed. believing legislation would overly restrict lending and thus slow the march of home ownership. ""The last attempt to pass antipredatory lending legislation occurred in 2005. but it was also stymied by the Republican leadership."" So heres where the Republicans failure is. They pushed for greater home ownership among lowincome peoplenot CRA. the Republicans. because this was their philosophy. This was their social program as opposed to rental housing. much more appropriate for lowincome people. And then they blocked our efforts to regulate it. Once again. we had to wait until 2007. In 2007. when the Democrats became the majority. we did pass legislation to block inappropriate subprime lending. predator lending. We got the bill through the House. This time. we werent able to get it through the Senate but we did have some success because the Federal Reserve under Mr. Bernanke has been a much more responsive institution to these kind of problems than Mr. Greenspan. I thought Mr. Greenspan did a good job in macroeconomic policy. But he was lousy because of his ideological opposition to any kind of regulation. Mr. Bernanke used the authority in 2007after we even moved on our legislationhe used the authority Mr. Greenspan wouldnt use and promulgated rules to ban subprime lending. I dont think they go quite far enough. and they should be statutory. So we will get a test. Mr. Speaker. because when we return from the break. the Committee on Financial Services will bring out a tough bill to put rules on all subprime lending. Essentially. were going to use our community banks as a modelthese wellrun institutions. Were going to take the rules they have long used and apply them to all loans to prevent the bad subprime loans. The last time we did that. twothirds of the Republicans voted against it. In fact. we were opposed by the Wall Street Journal. I do think the Wall Street Journals role here deserves some coverage. The Wall Street Journal has been one of those in this dishonest.antihistorical efforts to blame the Democrats. In particular. they had an editorial recently which said I was pushing for people to get subprime loans. Exactly the opposite is the case. And I wrote a letter. by the way. documenting that. and it could not be printed. I have to say this. I respect the press. but the people who write the Wall Street Journal editorials in this. Mr. Paul Gigot and Mr. Stephen Moore. are cowards and liars. They print stuff that they know is wrong and will not give me the access to reprint. Fortunately.

1110029982,Well. my dad always said give credit where credit is due. And the chairman was correct to say that those of us who were really strongly pushing these issues didnt get as much support as we would have liked to from our. colleagues on this side of the aisle. But as I look at some of the other amendments I put in. I got almost virtually no support from the other side of the aisle for some of our amendments which would have put in limitations. For example. I put in an amendment that would require the GSEs to hold only mortgages and mortgagebacked securities that exclusively support affordable housing. Now there is an idea if you think about it. if the idea behind the GSEs. one of the functions is to support affordable housing. then if you put that amendment in. it should fall in line with what the other side of the aisle was advocating. And they should support it. But there is another side benefit to allowing them to expand and grow outside of the area of affordable housing and that basically helps their balance sheet and also helps the remuneration to the people at the top of the organizations. to their CEOs. because if their balance sheet is good and their profits are based just like AIG. these bonuses and what have you. it benefits them as well. 0l 2215 But we got no votes. well. from the chairman. Im certain of. but basically from everyone from the other side of the aisle. My good friend. Ill explain one other amendment. The portfolio limitation. Representative PRICE offered that amendment as well. Same thing. to reduce the amount of the GSEs portfolios again. I do recall that the chairman was opposed to that. and I believe that just generally speaking. no support from the other side of the aisle. So I think thats the underlying message thats probably out in the media and outside of this House as well. as to where the two parties stood on it. Maybe we didnt have as much support as you and I would have liked from our side. but clearly it was a onesided push for a long time of seeing that there was a systemic problem and trying to do something about it.,111119510,GARRETT,SCOTT,H,NJ,M,R,5,voting,2009-04-02,699,Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey,31112,31171,04022009.txt,2087,384,111,2009,well dad alway said give credit credit due chairman correct say us realli strongli push issu didnt get much support would like colleagu side aisl look amend put got almost virtual support side aisl amend would put limit exampl put amend would requir gse hold mortgag mortgageback secur exclus support afford hous idea think idea behind gse one function support afford hous put amend fall line side aisl advoc support anoth side benefit allow expand grow outsid area afford hous basic help balanc sheet also help remuner peopl top organ ceo balanc sheet good profit base like aig bonus benefit well got vote well chairman im certain basic everyon side aisl good friend ill explain one amend portfolio limit repres price offer amend well thing reduc amount gse portfolio recal chairman oppos believ gener speak support side aisl think that underli messag that probabl media outsid hous well two parti stood mayb didnt much support would like side clearli onesid push long time see system problem tri someth,169,FALSE

1110006931,ida. Mr. Chairman. we clearly need to pass a stimulus package..a plan that will help our economy. Unfortunately. this plan spends lots of money but very little to incentivize the economy. It does very little to incentivize small businesses. small businesses which are the job creators in our country. Frankly. less than 10 percent of the money in this spending bill goes to infrastructure projects. And we hear a lot of talk about the infrastructure projects. I agree with that. But less than 10 percent of the bill goes to infrastructure projects. Most of them. unfortunately. Mr. Chairman. go to create a larger Federal bureaucracy with little accountability and nearly no oversight. Does that sound familiar? This House last week was here passing legislation that the Senate already said they werent going to do to try to cover up and fix up the embarrassment of the TARP legislation. of that bailout legislation. that had no accountability and no oversight. This bill is more of the same. This is Son of TARP. except its even bigger. with little money and accountability. with little oversight. with less than 10 percent for infrastructure and with very little to help the job creators. the small businesses in our great country. We need better accountability. We need more oversight. We need more for infrastructure. We need more to help the small businesses and less to just send. it to create a larger Federal bureaucracy with no oversight.

1110003563,Mr. President. I take to the floor right now to talk about my good friend. the former Governor of Iowa and our soon to be Secretary of Agriculture. Tom Vilsack. Before I do. I would be remiss if I did not at this time talk about what it was like to be at the inauguration of the 44th President of the United States. This is my ninth inauguration. My first was Jimmy Carter when I was a freshman Congressman in 1977 and then two Reagans. Bush. two Clintons. two more Bushes. And so this is my ninth. I can tell you. I have never seen anything such as this. To be out there today. I mean this is once in history that something such as this happens. I was watching a television program yesterday. a news program. and JIM CLYBURN. our colleague on the House side. was talking about the importance of today and what it meant to him. He went on to talk about not only himself but so many people from where he is from in South Carolina and other places. elsewhere. He said. I remember my grandparents telling me about their parents being slaves and how close the connection was. And to think that today America saw inaugurated as our 44th President an AfricanAmerican. Not only does this say a great deal about Barack Obama. but it says a great deal about America and how far we have come. Someone asked me what I thought earlier about his speech. I thought three things: uplifting. sobering. and challenging. I think that is what we want from a President. We want a President who will lift us up. a President who will be honest and square with us but a President who also challenges us. That is what I thought President Obama did in his speech today. So it was a great day. not only for President Obama and Michelle and their family. for our great friend. JOE BIDEN. now our Vice President. and Jill and his family. a great day for America. a real turning point. I think. in our history. So we look forward with confidence and with optimism to the future. I wished to take the floor today to say a few words about my friend. Tom PS661 Printed on recycled paper. Vilsack. who I hope the Senate today will concur in his being passed through for being Secretary of Agriculture. I have known Tom well since the 1980s. He was a lawyer in Mount Pleasant. IA. at that time. We had a terrible catastrophe in agriculture. farmers were going broke. a lot of suicides were being committed in my State and around rural America. Tom Vilsack was a smalltown lawyer. I did not know him from anybody. But he took upon himself the job of defending a lot of these small farmers. helping them to work through their problems. and getting them through these hard times. That is the first time I ever came in contact with him. I thought he was one of those rare individuals who saw something that was wrong which needed to be done and he would involve himself in it. He did not make any money doing this. There was no money to be made. But he got involved in it. and I can tell you. he helped many small farmers hang onto their farms. Well. later on. by then a tragedy happened in Mount Pleasant. IA. Tom Vilsack was then on the city council. There was a terrible tragedy in which the mayor had been murdered. and they asked Tom to take over as mayoragain. another catastrophe in that small community. So Tom Vilsack then took over as mayor of Mount Pleasant. pulled the city together. kept it going. and lifted it up. Shortly after that then. he ran to be a State Senator and was elected as a State Senator. He served very admirably there. He then later ran to be Governor and served for two terms as the Governor of our State of Iowa. He had a great two terms8 years. 4 years eachas our Governor. Again. he showed he could bring people together. That is why I think he is going to be good with our former colleague. now President Obama. For the entire 8 years Tom Vilsack was Governor. he had a Republican legislature. but he worked with them. They worked together. We got some good things done in the State of Iowa. both with a Republican legislature and a Democratic Governor. I think that showed his method. That. plus what he had done earlier. I think showed the true mark of this individual. So I could not have been happier when I found that President Obama had picked him to be Secretary of Agriculture. Tom Vilsack knows production agriculture. He knows what is happening out on the farms. He also is one of the strongest proponents of the conservation of natural resources and clean water and clean air. Suffice to say. I think all my friends at Pheasants Forever and Ducks Unlimited and all the people I go hunting with every year love Tom Vilsack because of all he has done to encourage wildlife habitats and the conservation of our natural resourcessomething. again. I feel very strongly about. Then. again. in his hearing before our Agriculture Committee. he talked about nutrition and the role nutrition plays in health care reform and how we have to think about prevention and wellness. That starts with our kids. And what starts with our kids? School lunches and school breakfasts and the foods they eat in school. the women. infants. and childrens supplemental feeding program. what kind of food are they getting? Now. before the Agriculture Committee this year. Senator CHAMBLISS and I will be working together on our committee to reauthorize the Child Nutrition Act. That is the school lunch. school breakfast. and the WIC program. the women. infants. and childrens supplemental feeding program. We have to do better for our kids. We have to get better food. locally grown foods. healthier foods. fruits and vegetables. and things such as that for our kids to eat. He talked about this in his hearing before our committee. So I do not wish to take any more time of the Senate. I see our distinguished leader is in the Chamber. But I wished to thank President Obama for asking Governor Vilsack to be Secretary of Agriculture. I have asked Senator CHAMBLISS. We know of no objectionsnot one objection on our committeeto his nomination. So I hope the Senate will. this afternoon. by unanimous consent. clear him so tomorrow he can be at the door. He said: As soon as I am confirmed. the first thing I want to do is go to the Department of Agriculture and stand outside at 7 oclock in the morning to greet all the people coming in because I want them to know I care about them. that I honor their work and look forward to being Secretary of the Department. The one Department I always say. of all the Secretaries we havethe Secretaries of State and Treasury get all this publicity. and they travel around the world and all that and get a lot of publicitythe Secretary of Agriculture hardly gets any publicity. But no Departmentno Departmenttouches every American every day as closely and as intimately as the Department of Agriculture: the food you eat. the clothes you wear. the food safety programs.

1110037636,Madam President. I am going to read a unanimous consent request in a moment. but before then. because I dont have any time at the conclusion of the last vote before the vote on final passage. I wish to take a minute to thank the majority leader. Senator REID. for making it possible for this bill to be before the Senate this week. I am grateful to him and his staff. I thank my staff. who have done a terrific job: Jonathan Miller. principally. from my Banking Committee staff. as well as many others from the Banking Committee staff who worked very hard to bring this bill together and to create the opportunity for our colleagues to offer as many as 20 different amendments. most of them in direct relation to the bill but others to add items which will strengthen the bill. I want to specifically thank Colin McGinnis. Beth Cooper. Dean Shahinian. Julie Chon. Brian Filipowich. Misha MintzRoth. Deborah Katz. Matt Green. Amy Widestrom. Ella Humphry. and James Bair. I thank Senator SHELBY and his staff as wellBill Duhnke. Mark Oesterle. Andrew Olmem. Peggy Kuhn. Hester Pierce. and Jim Johnson. We worked very cooperatively. While there were some differences of opinion on a couple matters involved with this legislation. overall we had great cooperation. as we have had over the past 2 years I have been chairman of the committee. I am grateful to him and his staff for the cooperation they have with my office. We have a strong committee of some 23 members. Almost a quarter of this body serves on the Banking Committee. They add great value to the process. I am grateful to them. This is an important matter. not just for financial institutions but. more importantlyI say that with some cautionto open up lines of credit. We need to have an increase in deposit insurance. We need to have an increase in the borrowing authority. Sheila Bair. for whom most of us have great respect. is Chairperson of the .Pederal Department Insurance Corporation and is doing a wonderful job. This bill includes that. We have provisions in here to provide a safe harbor for servicersa key component of the legislation designed to get servi~ers to pursue loan modifications more aggressively. I thank Senator MARTNEZ of Florida for his contribution to this provision. I see Senator ENSIGN in the Chamber. who. working with Senator BoxER. added value to this bill as well. making it possible for homeowners to determine who actually holds their mortgages. Senator GRASSLEY added contributions. as well. to accountability and transparency. Senator REED of Rhode Island has done a great deal in providing greater flexibility in terms of warrants. which I think is going to .strengthen the bill as well. Senator REED also contributed groundbreaking legislation to fight homelessness along with Senator BOND. Invariably. when I start doing- this without. a note in front of me. I am going toforget some Member and their contribution to the bill. So I will reserve the ability to amend these remarks to make sure I include others who have contributed to this legislation. But this bill includes the kinds of steps we need to be taking in order to get our economy moving. to increase that confidenceand optimism so critical to economic recovery. Madam President. 10.000 foreclosures a day is unacceptable. This bill will now provide the opportunity for us to be able to reduce that number. Some estimates are that as many as 1.7 million to 2 million homeowners could be positively affected by what we are doing today with this legislation. That is no small number when you consider the total numbers that could be adversely affected. Our hope is that will do just that. to make that kind of a difference. in addition to the other matters I have already mentioned that were added by amendment or included in the underlying bill. So while this is not going to change everything. it is not going to solve every problem. it is a major step in the right direction in terms of this economic recovery we are -all interested in. There is not a Member in this Chamberregardless of the differences we may have on how to get therewho does not want to do everything in their power to see to it that our country once again has that sense of confidence that has been the hallmark of America for more than two centuries. Certainly. we are going through a difficult time. Individually. people understand it: they know it. We have an administration under President Obama that is working hard to do everything possible to see to it that we move in the right direction. So I am grateful to my colleagues who have shown a lot of patience over the last several days to get to this point. I thank them for that. Senator KERRY. Senator CASEY. Senator FEINGOLDI mentioned Senator ENSIGNSenator SNOWE. Senator BOND. and Senator PRYOR have all either been sponsors or cosponsors of major amendments on this bill. and I express my gratitude to all of them.,111114091,DODD,CHRISTOPHER,S,CT,M,D,,voting,2009-05-06,85,Mr. DODD,2269,2421,05062009.txt,4911,849,111,2009,madam presid go read unanim consent request moment dont time conclus last vote vote final passag wish take minut thank major leader senat reid make possibl bill senat week grate staff thank staff done terrif job jonathan miller princip bank committe staff well mani other bank committe staff work hard bring bill togeth creat opportun colleagu offer mani differ amend direct relat bill other add item strengthen bill want specif thank colin mcginni beth cooper dean shahinian juli chon brian deborah katz matt green ami ella humphri jame bair thank senat shelbi staff duhnk mark oesterl andrew peggi kuhn hester pierc jim johnson work cooper differ opinion coupl matter involv legisl overal great cooper past year chairman committe grate staff cooper offic strong committe member almost quarter bodi serv bank committe add great valu process grate import matter financi institut say open line credit need increas deposit insur need increas borrow author sheila bair us great respect chairperson peder depart insur corpor wonder job bill includ provis provid safe harbor key compon legisl design get pursu loan modif aggress thank senat florida contribut provis see senat ensign chamber work senat boxer ad valu bill well make possibl homeown determin actual hold mortgag senat grassley ad contribut well account transpar senat reed rhode island done great deal provid greater flexibl term warrant think go strengthen bill well senat reed also contribut groundbreak legisl fight homeless along senat bond invari start without note front go member contribut bill reserv abil amend remark make sure includ other contribut legisl bill includ kind step need take order get economi move increas optim critic econom recoveri madam presid foreclosur day unaccept bill provid opportun us abl reduc number estim mani million million homeown could posit affect today legisl small number consid total number could advers affect hope make kind differ addit matter alreadi mention ad amend includ underli bill go chang everyth go solv everi problem major step right direct term econom recoveri interest member differ may get therewho want everyth power see countri sens confid hallmark america two centuri certainli go difficult time individu peopl understand know administr presid obama work hard everyth possibl see move right direct grate colleagu shown lot patienc last sever day get point thank senat kerri senat casey senat mention senat snow senat bond senat pryor either sponsor cosponsor major amend bill express gratitud,411,FALSE
1110061176,Mr. President. following leader remarks. there will be a period of morning business for 1 hour. with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each. The Republicans will control the first half. the majority will control the final halfhour. Following morning business. the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 2996. the Interior appropriations bill. At 12 oclock. the Senate will proceed to a vote in relation to the Feinstein amendment. The Senate will then recess from 12:30 to 2:15 p.m. for the weekly caucus luncheons. The official Senate photograph of the 111th Congress is at 2:15 p.m. today. Senators should be seated at their desks in the Chamber promptly at 2:15. Several things. No. 1. on the Interior appropriations bill. today is the day for Members to offer amendments. They had Thursday. yesterday. and today. so this is the time they should act because I am not sure what we will do after today. but we are not going to spend more time on this bill. We shouldnt. at least. I hope we dont have to because we have to get to the Defense appropriations bill at the earliest possible date. As to the photograph. normally what we do is we come in and convene at 2:15 and recess until the photograph is completed. and that is what we will do today. more than likely. I would also say that. as we speak. the Finance Committee has been involved in a markup of that important piece of legislation for 1 hour now. They started at 9 oclock. They probably will only make opening statements this morning before the weekly caucus luncheons. After that. the amendment process will start. There will be a decision made. hopefully within the next several days. as to how we will proceed on this legislation. It is my hope we will have a bill reported out of that committee that will be brought to the floor. and then my responsibility will be to meld that bill with the HELP bill so we can have a piece of legislation on the Senate floor in the near future. This is an important step in the process. It is a step I am confident will bring results that will be favorable to the country. If we cant work this outto do something within the committee structurethen we will be forced to do the reconciliation. Of course. that will be a last resort. I know a number of steps we can take before we do that. but a reconciliation bill is there for us. It was put there by the Budget Committee. If we cant come up with a bipartisan bill with the help of a few Republicans. then we will have to go the route of reconciliation. On reconciliation. under the order. there is only 20 hours of debate. It would be a free amendment process. which would take some time. We have done reconciliation on many different issues in recent years. We have done it on a number of health care issues. including the Medicare legislation. But it remains to be seen as to whether we will have to do reconciliation. I am confident and hopeful we wont have to do that but only time will tell. I would also say. we have scheduled the recess for the Columbus Day week. The reason that is done is because if we dont have that break. there would be 11 weeks until Thanksgiving and that is difficult. The Senate has changed over the years. Many Senators families are in places other than Washington and 11 weeks is difficult not to have a week you can go home. But whether we will be able to keep that whole week depends a lot on when we get to health care legislation. It is obvious that if we are in the middle of health care. we cant take a recess for 1 week. So we will see as time goes on. We have CBO scoring and that will take a little bit of time and there are always difficulties that arise when you have a major piece of legislation such as this. But the schedule is as we have outlined it. We have given all interested parties the days that there will be no votes. and we do have that week scheduled now for a recess. but when that was done. we did it indicating it may not come to be. It is according to what happens with the schedule. We have a number of mustdo things. and hopefully some of those will be done before the end of the month. We have to make a decision on the highway bill. we have postal reform. and we have a continuing resolution because we wont be able to complete all the appropriations bills prior to the end of the month. So there are a lot of things to do. and we will do our best to get them all done.,111120961,REID,HARRY,S,NV,M,D,,voting,2009-09-22,353,Mr. REID,19429,19581,09222009.txt,4406,828,111,2009,mr presid follow leader remark period morn busi hour senat permit speak minut republican control first half major control final halfhour follow morn busi senat resum consider hr interior appropri bill oclock senat proceed vote relat feinstein amend senat recess pm weekli caucu luncheon offici senat photograph th congress pm today senat seat desk chamber promptli sever thing interior appropri bill today day member offer amend thursday yesterday today time act sure today go spend time bill shouldnt least hope dont get defens appropri bill earliest possibl date photograph normal come conven recess photograph complet today like would also say speak financ committe involv markup import piec legisl hour start oclock probabl make open statement morn weekli caucu luncheon amend process start decis made hope within next sever day proceed legisl hope bill report committe brought floor respons meld bill help bill piec legisl senat floor near futur import step process step confid bring result favor countri cant work outto someth within committe forc reconcili cours last resort know number step take reconcili bill us put budget committe cant come bipartisan bill help republican go rout reconcili reconcili order hour debat would free amend process would take time done reconcili mani differ issu recent year done number health care issu includ medicar legisl remain seen whether reconcili confid hope wont time tell would also say schedul recess columbu day week reason done dont break would week thanksgiv difficult senat chang year mani senat famili place washington week difficult week go home whether abl keep whole week depend lot get health care legisl obviou middl health care cant take recess week see time goe cbo score take littl bit time alway difficulti aris major piec legisl schedul outlin given interest parti day vote week schedul recess done indic may come accord happen schedul number mustdo thing hope done end month make decis highway bill postal reform continu resolut wont abl complet appropri bill prior end month lot thing best get done,331,FALSE
1110063072,I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 1333 addresses the gap in the law governing the transportation of explosive materials by giving federally recognized Indian tribes the same status already given Federal. State and local governments. In 2002. Congress passed the Safe Explosives Act. which prohibits the transportation. shipment. receipt and importation of explosive materials without specific Federal permits or licenses. The act exempts Federal. State and local governments from this requirement. but due to an oversight. the exemption does not cover federally recognized Indian tribes and their agencies. This bill corrects that oversight. Fireworks can play an integral role in the religious and cultural ceremonies of many Indian tribes. This bill will facilitate those religious and cultural practices without compromising safety. This act does not exempt Indian tribes from complying with safe storage requirements. Like State agencies. tribes still will be required to comply with Federal explosives storage regulations. H.R. 1333 enjoys bipartisan support. I thank the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. RACIL GRIJALVA. for bringing this oversight to the attention of the House and for his hard work on this bill.

1110009352,Madam President. for the benefit of Senators. I would like to take a moment to talk about where we are in consideration of the bill. Today is the third day of Senate consideration. Yesterday was quite productive. We had a full debate and very little downtime. which I especially appreciate. The Senate considered nine amendments and had rollcall votes on four. One was adopted by voice vote. The Senate adopted a Republican amendment by Senator COBURN to strike a tax amendment related to film production. And with an overwhelming bipartisan 71to26 vote. the Senate adopted a MikulskiBrownback arpendment to allow a deduction for interest on the purchase of motor vehicles. By voice vote. the Senate adopted a Harkin amendment on which Senator SPECTER played a very important role. who worked very hard. Senator SPEC.TER did. on the Harkin amendment. to provide additional funding for the National Institutes of Health. So where are we now? Pending are a Murray amendment to strengthen infrastructure investmentsthese Are all pendinga Vitter amendment to strike several spending items. an IsaksonLieberman amendment to provide a tax credit for home purchases. a FeingoldMcCain amendment to provide greater accountability of congressional earmarks. a Cardin small business bonds amendment. a DeMint amendment making a series of tax cuts in lieu of the pending substitute. a Thune amendment in the nature of a substitute. a Thune amendment on new programs in the bill. and a Dorgan amendment on runaway plants. I might add that the Democratic caucus is conducting an issues conference today. but the floor is open for business. We expect a number of Republican amendments and also Democratic amendments. We hope to have several votes on amendments this afternoon and evening after the Democratic issues conference concludes. perhaps starting about 5:30 today. although I cannot say -that that is going to be an exact time. That is for the leaders to determine. For the information of Senators. let me say I expect that we hope to have as many as 12 amendments pending today. and we hope to stack votes on these at the end of the afternoon and into the evening. In addition to the Republican amendments that we expect to be offered. we also expect Senator BINGAMAN. who has expressed an interest in offering an amendment. as well as I mentioned Senator DORGANs runaway plants. Senator WYDEN also spoke to me about his amendment on bonuses that he intends to offer with Senator SNOWE. Once again. I urge Senators. let the managers know of their intentions to offer amendments. We want to give Senators as much notice as possible. I reemphasize notice is efficient. It helps us get our amendments passed here.

1110035463,I thank you. I suppose this is the parliamentary part of the legislative process that a motion to recommit has to be entertained. but before I begin my discussion about the regrets of it. I still insist on complimenting the Members of the House of Representatives who have understood that there are particular acts of violence against the law that are intolerable and should be dealt with as effectively as possible. The question is what is the most effective way. Now. what we have been proposing. since 1968. during the civil rights era. where there was an inability to seek prosecution of violators of civil rights laws at the State level. a southern President. Lyndon Johnson. began realizing that there had to be a Federal method of dealing with certain crimes that were not only violent to the victims but served to send a message of intimidation to others in that same class or group. Those groups. we have listed. These groups are being denied the most fundamental protection of liberty. They are targeted for the most extreme violence by extremists who have decided. in their own warped view of how we should exist among each other in our society. as people who dont deserve to have life. The groups that are on this protected list and are identified as where hate crime laws kick in are being protected in the same way that has been going on all the way back these many years. since 1968. The targets are not only the particular individuals who are attacked. but an extension of everyone in the group. The unmistakable intended threat to all is that not only are you not welcome. but you are despised. and you are not safe. and we are coming after you. But this motion seeks simply to ignore these essential facts. Let me talk about the three areas mentioned. The armed services. for example. While people who are disturbed at governmental policies and may direct anger at the military. members of the armed services are not victims of biasbased prejudice or hatred. To the contrary. they are honored for their service. to our Nation. with national holidays in their honor. memorials. and other economic benefits. all of which are deserved. But they are not in the same situation as the groups we are seeking to protect in this bill. Besides. specific protections for members of the armed services already exist in the Federal lawit makes killing someone in the military a capital crime.,111119030,CONYERS,JOHN,H,MI,M,D,14,voting,2009-04-29,538,Mr. CONYERS,30033,30103,04292009.txt,2397,417,111,2009,thank suppos parliamentari part legisl process motion recommit entertain begin discuss regret still insist compliment member hous repres understood particular act violenc law intoler dealt effect possibl question effect way propos sinc civil right era inabl seek prosecut violat civil right law state level southern presid lyndon johnson began realiz feder method deal certain crime violent victim serv send messag intimid other class group group list group deni fundament protect liberti target extrem violenc extremist decid warp view exist among societi peopl dont deserv life group protect list identifi hate crime law kick protect way go way back mani year sinc target particular individu attack extens everyon group unmistak intend threat welcom despis safe come motion seek simpli ignor essenti fact let talk three area mention arm servic exampl peopl disturb government polici may direct anger militari member arm servic victim prejudic hatr contrari honor servic nation nation holiday honor memori econom benefit deserv situat group seek protect bill besid specif protect member arm servic alreadi exist feder lawit make kill someon militari capit crime,176,FALSE
1110014133,Mr. President. all these economists agree that government spending is not the way to improve economic performance. Over the past year. I have repeatedly called for an extensive examination of the origins of this economic crisis and of the potential solutions. So far. the majority has refused. In the absence of any analysis or detailed information. they have chosen time and again to solve the crisis by throwing money at it. I believe this is laying the groundwork for a much greater economic catastrophe. It took until 1982 for our publicly held debt to cross the $1 trillion mark. In the 27 short years since. we have amassed a debt 10 times that amount. Now we are about to vote on a measure that will. in a single year. add to the national debt what it took nearly 200. years to accumulate. I fear this is a day we will come to regret. not only because I believe the stimulus bill will not work but because it will mark the day when our generation decided we were not capable of enduring the consequences of our own actions. and therefore future generations must shoulder the burden we could not find the courage to bear ourselves.

1110017564,Mr. Speaker. Im mad and Im not going to take it anymore. Ive had enough of my colleagues bashing my district. my hometown and the community I love. Las Vegas. Ive sat back as Las Vegas has been maligned. insulted and lied about for the sole purpose of making political points. Ive been waiting for common sense to prevail. But Im here to say that this nonsense. the bashing and the lies about Las Vegas have got to end. and theyve got to end now. It started with Senator McCONNELLS misguided attack on the stimulus bill by singling out a mob museum in Las Vegas as an earmark in the stimulus package. Theres only a couple of things wrong with that. There never was an earmark in the stimulus bill. There are none. And there certainly wasnt one for a mob museum. There was never a mention of it in the stimulus package. But the lies continued. And then we found out about the maglev train. Countless Republicans have misrepresented the $8 billion included in the stimulus bill as being an earmark for the Las VegasAnaheim maglev route. The only problem is. even after it was pointed out that there is no earmark. that Las Vegas and California are going to have to compete with the other projects. that this has been a project thats been in the works for 20 years. and that it will bring thousands of visitors to the Las Vegas area and to the Southern California area. the lies continue. The latest one was Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal. He repeated the lie in his televised response to the Presidents remarks to Congress. claiming the bill included funding for a magnetic levitation line from Las Vegas to Disneyland. That is absolute nonsense. And then it goes one worse. Representative TRENT FRANKS just mentioned today that theres a maglev train going all the way from Disneyland to the Moonlit Bunny Brothel. Now. I grew up in Las Vegas. Ive never heard of the Moonlit Bunny Brothel. But I guarantee that maglev train is not going there. And then the latest whipping boy is in the omnibus bill. Sustainable Las Vegas. Just yesterday Senator MCCAIN took to the floor of the Senate to attack Sustainable Las Vegas. What does Sustainable Las Vegas mean. he yelled? Well. let me enlighten the Senator. Its a University of Nevada education and research program on energy supply. water supply and air quality. very serious issues for the desert Southwest. cities like Las Vegas and Phoenix and Tucson. But the Senator knows that. So why is that program being singled out? Why is it different from the hundreds of other projects that are given to university research programs throughout the United States. including universities in Arizona? Because it has Las Vegas in its name. And let me tell you about my hometown of Las Vegas. Its a community of families looking for a better life. a community of schools and churches and mosques. .Saturday soccer. a community of working people. small businesses and beautiful hotels. And that brings me to the most egregious affront to Las Vegas. Stop badmouthing Las Vegas. and stop telling businesses and major companies to stay away from Vegas. You are hurting our economy. Youre forcing major layoffs of employees in the hotel industry. Hundreds of thousands of Nevadans depend on the tourism and convention business for their livelihood. Las Vegas has long been a city where serious business is conducted. where small and large conventions can be accommodated. When it comes to business meetings. Las Vegas is the best city on the planet. You still get the best bang for your buck. Great hotels. great convention facilities. great transportation. great restaurants and a great price. When you badmouth Las Vegas. you are hurting our )major industry. youre hurting your fellow citizens. By taking away their livelihood. you are taking food out of their childrens mouths.

1110041111,I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. one of the smartest things that the President did once elected and all the campaign rhetoric was out of the way. he went ahead and continued the BushCheney policy in the Middle East. primarily by reappointing Secretary of Defense Gates and recognizing that the surge. in fact. worked. basically kept the plans for Iraq and Afghanistan on track. including a new surge in Afghanistan. There was one sharp deviation from the Bush doctrine that Mr. Obama did not choose to follow. and that was his idea of closing Guantanamo even though the Guantanamo prison has proved to be effective. And we had lots of testimony from people who are in the military and security that these very bad actors need to stay in an island off continental America. Thats why we Republicans in committee offered the Wolf amendment that says that If youre going to transfer the Guantanamo prisoners. that we should have the Nations governors approve the transfers to their States before it happens. Also that a threat assessment should b done. Now to their credit. the majority party did put in some language that says the President shall submit to Congress in writing a comprehensive plan before October 1. and were happy about that. But what this plan does not do. it does not require a risk assessment. Releasing the detainees to American soils -could cause problems. and we would also like to see the security assessment include what its impact could be on the safety of American citizens. Also it does not require notification to Congress. governors. State legislators or local communities. We believe that much courtesy should be done. And It does not require the consent of the State governor. Why is that important? Its interesting to note that when the President was recently in Europe. trying to ask them to take some of the Guantanamo prisoners. they all declined. All the European. all the EU. countries want us to close it. bit they wont take any of these prisoners.

1110009838,"Mr. President. if the Chair would please notify me when I have spoken 4 minutes. I will be. in fact. that brief. The Senator from Illinois quoted the Gipper. Ronald Reagan. That always gets Republicans ears perked up. When he said: I am always happy to take 80 percent. I dont need 100 percentRepublicans would be happy to take 80 percent. We would be happy to take 50 percent. In fact. probably most of us would be happy to take 30 percent. But so far. virtually every Republican amendment has been defeated. So when there is talk about the President ushering in an era of good feeling by having us down to the White House and talking to us and listening to us. that is great. We have all commented on our appreciation for the Presidents efforts. At some point. however. since Republicans do have some good ideas. that has to be translated into some of our ideas being a part of this bill. I think the American people agree with us. A Gallup poll. a week ago. said 38 percent of the people would pass the bill. 54 percent would either reject it or require major changes in the bill. We are reflecting the mood of the Republic. According to a Rasmussen survey. a poll from February 4: Support for the stimulus has fallen now to 37 percent. 43 percent oppose. Two weeks ago. 45 percent -supported it. Last week. 42 percent supported it. Now it is down to 37 percent. and 43 percent oppose it. So that is the reason Republicans are standing before this body asking thatbecause the American people want major changes in it. because a majority now oppose itwe should not have to take 100 percent or even 98 percent of the bill and then be accused of partisanship. Republicans have good ideas. and one of them is the amendment pending by my colleague from Arizona. Without going through all of the elements. since I am very limited in my time. let me just note one of the most important. The Democratic Speaker of the House has said over and over. this bill needs to be timely. targeted. and temporary. The Senator from Arizona is focusing on temporary. What he says. very briefly. is. when the economy begins to recover. then all of this spending that otherwise would be permanent should cease. So the amendment he has pending would require that once we have had two consecutive quarters of economic growth greater than 2 percent of inflationadjusted GDP. then all of the stimulus spending would cease and the unobligated funds would return to the taxpayer. At that point. then we would need to reduce spending to accommodate the huge cost of this legislation. Now. that is a real test of where we are in this legislation. Is this a question of getting all of this spending we wanted for the last 8 years and we are going to spend out the majority of that spending after the year 2011 or is this truly a stimulus bill that is targeted at getting the economy moving again. and once that happens. then the spending for the future under this legislation"" ceases? There are 34 new programs in this bill. new Government programs. There is $180 billionplus on mandatoryin other words. permanentspending. That is not temporary. One of the things Senator MCCAINs amendment stresses is. lets focus on the temporary. Once we begin recovering. then stop spending all of this stimulus money. Mr. President. there is a reason Republicans want an opportunity to have our amendments debated .and. hopefully. accepted. and that is because the American people have told us they want this legislationfixed. That is why I support the amendment of my colleague from Arizona. which will go a long way toward that end.",111116461,KYL,JON,S,AZ,M,R,,voting,2009-02-05,42,Mr. KYL,1496,1600,02052009.txt,3592,637,111,2009,mr presid chair would pleas notifi spoken minut fact brief senat illinoi quot gipper ronald reagan alway get republican ear perk said alway happi take percent dont need would happi take percent would happi take percent fact probabl us would happi take percent far virtual everi republican amend defeat talk presid usher era good feel us white hous talk us listen us great comment appreci presid effort point howev sinc republican good idea translat idea part bill think american peopl agre us gallup poll week ago said percent peopl would pass bill percent would either reject requir major chang bill reflect mood republ accord rasmussen survey poll februari support stimulu fallen percent percent oppos two week ago percent support last week percent support percent percent oppos reason republican stand bodi ask thatbecaus american peopl want major chang major oppos itw take percent even percent bill accus partisanship republican good idea one amend pend colleagu arizona without go element sinc limit time let note one import democrat speaker hous said bill need time target temporari senat arizona focus temporari say briefli economi begin recov spend otherwis would perman ceas amend pend would requir two consecut quarter econom growth greater percent inflationadjust gdp stimulu spend would ceas unoblig fund would return taxpay point would need reduc spend accommod huge cost legisl real test legisl question get spend want last year go spend major spend year truli stimulu bill target get economi move happen spend futur legisl ceas new program bill new govern program billionplu word temporari one thing senat mccain amend stress let focu temporari begin recov stop spend stimulu money mr presid reason republican want opportun amend debat hope accept american peopl told us want support amend colleagu arizona go long way toward end,297,FALSE
1110074879,"Mr. President. it is disappointing for those of us on this side of the aisle to not be permitted to offer an amendment or motion that is as important as this. so I will go ahead with my remarks. This is another major problem in the Reid bill. Of the many taxes in this bill. I am especially worried about the excise tax on medical devices. Medical device technology is responsible for saving many lives and extending the overall life expectancy of people in the United States. In the United States. over 6.000 companies are in the business of developing lifesaving medical products. The majority of these companies are very small businesses. Small business we tend to measure around here as being those with less than 500 employees. So what will happen when the Reid amendment imposes a tax hike of $20 billion on these innovative medical devices? I think that is something we ought to consider if we are considering the quality of life in America and quality health care to preserve that life and extend life expectancy. During the markup of the Finance Committee bill. I asked the question to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxationand let me emphasize the word ""nonpartisan"" because these folks are professionals. So both of these organizations. the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation. said these excise taxes will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices and higher insurance premiums. Also. I wish to emphasize on this chart a statement of the Chief Actuary of the HHS. The Congressional Budget Office. the Joint Committee on Taxation. and the Chief Actuary all say the tax gets passed on to consumers. Who are the consumers of these devices? Who is going to bear the cost of the new medical device excise tax? Well. it is quite a burden. so I am going to share some reallife stories here. I will start by telling the story of the Tillman family. a family who would bear the burden of this new medical device tax. At only 5 months old. Tiana Tillman had her life saved by a medical device. This story has received a lot of attention because Tianas father is a professional football player for the Chicago Bears. However. lifesaving stories such as this happen all across the country regularly. When Charles Tillman reported to training camp in 2008. it wasnt long before his coach told him that his 5monthold daughter Tiana had been rushed to the hospital. When Charles got to the hospital. Tianas heart rate was over 200 beats per minute. That doctor told Charles and his wife Jackie that Tiana may not make it through the night. Tiana survived that night. and after a series of tests. she was diagnosed with cardio myopathy. an enlarged heart that is unable to function properly. Her condition was critical. and without a heart transplant she would not survive. But finding pediatric donors is very difficult and many children do not survive the long wait time. so Tiana was immediately put on an ECMO. a device that would help the function of the heart while Tiana waited for a transplant. However. ECMO is an old device that has many shortcomings. Infants can only survive on ECMO for about 3 weeks. much shorter than the average wait for a donor heart. ECMO also requires that the patient take a paralytic medication which prevents a patient from moving and at the same time that obviously weakens the body. The Tillmans waited for one of two outcomes: Either Tiana would receive a transplant or she would die waiting on ECMO. But then the doctors told them about a new pediatric medical device called the Berlin heart. The Berlin heart is an external device that performs the function of the heart and lungs. It is designed for a longterm support to keep infants and young children alive for up to 421 days while they wait for the donor heartobviously a lot longer than the 3 weeks on ECMO. So the Tillmans decided to move forward with the Berlin heart. After 13 days of being on ECMO without any movement. Tiana underwent surgery to connect the Berlin heart. So we have pictures here that show what this is like. These two photos are of Tiana with the Berlin heart. You can see that this device is run by a laptop at the foot of the hospital bed. It pumps the blood through her body. a job that her heart could not perform on its own. Unlike ECMO. the Berlin heart and its longterm support capabilities allowed the Tillmans some peace of mind while they waited for that donor. The doctor said that the Berlin heart helped Tiana regain her strength because she was off the paralytic medication and was finally able to move. Not long after Tiana was connected to the Berlin heart. a donor was found and Tiana underwent an 8hour transplant surgery. The risky surgery was a success. Usually it takes some time for the new heart to start working. but doctors said that due to Tianas strength. her new heart started working immediately. I wish to talk about the tax on devices such as this. This picture shows Tiana today holding a football. That is Tiana today. and we shouldnt be surprised about her love for football. considering her father is a professional football player. She enjoys playing on her swing set and watching her dad play football. There are many people responsible for the successful effort to save Tianas life. but without the Berlin heart to keep her alive and help her to gain strength. they may not have had that opportunity. What does this legislation have to do with this story about Tiana? Well. the Reid bill would increase costs for families such as the Tillmans. In fact. the Reid bill would tax every pediatric medical device. Pediatric devices arent the only devices affected by the tax on medical devices in the Reid bill. The Reid bill also taxes one of the most important modern technologies: automatic external defibrillators. The defibrillator is used to save people from sudden cardiac arrest. and that is the leading cause of death in this country. Each year. nearly 325.000 people die from sudden cardiac arrest. That is nearly 1.000 deaths a day. Sudden cardiac arrest occurs when the hearts electrical system malfunctions and the heart stops beating abruptly and without warning. When this happens. the heart is no longer able to pump blood to the rest of the body. and for about 95 percent of the victims. death occurs. Once cardiac arrest occurs. the clock starts ticking and the victims proximity to a defibrillator could mean the difference between living and dying. As many as 30 to 50 percent of the victims could survive if such a device is used within 5 minutes of sudden cardiac arrest. Here we have the story then of Mari Ann Wearda. Mari Ann is a constituent of the county I have lived my entire 76 years in. Butler County. IA. She is also a survivor of a sudden cardiac arrest. thanks to the prompt response of the Hampton Police Department and the availability of a defibrillator. On July 26. 2002. Mari Ann pulled up to a stoplight in Hampton. IA. Without any warning. Mari Ann experienced sudden cardiac arrest. As she slumped over the steering wheel. her car drifted across the road. climbed the curb. knocked over a sign. and came to rest against a tree. She was only minutes away from brain damage and death. At 11:38 a.m. the police station dispatched Officer Chad Elness. who arrived at the scene 2 minutes later. at 11:40. When Officer Elness arrived. Mari Ann was as blue as his uniform. according to his own report. Officer Elness attached the defibrillator to Mari Ann and pushed the button. sending 200 joules of electricity through her heart. That was one of the two shocks that Mar Ann required. Between the shocks. the defibrillator prompted officer Elness to perform CPR. Twice he almost lost Mar Ann. But by 11:50 a.m.. Mar Ann had a pulse and her color was improving. At 11:52. just 11 minutes after the defibrillator was turned on. it had saved her life and was turned off. Mari Ann then was taken by helicopter to Mercy Hospital. Mason City. IA. where she received care. One week laterjust one week latershe was back home with no permanent damage. Defibrillators are only effective if they are used within minutes of cardiac arrest. which means that in order to save more lives. there needs to be more of these devices. But do you know what this bill would do about all that? It would increase the cost. meaning there would then be fewer defibrillators. We understand the laws of economics. If we increase a price. we get less of it. If we lower a price. we get more of it. So we are going to increase the price of these devices. That would make it more difficult for police departments. schools. libraries. churches. and other public places to purchase defibrillators. or for an individual to have one. If you have to be within 5 minutes of their use. you can understand why they have to be in every police department. school. library. church. and a lot of other places. Right now. only onethird of police departments are equipped with defibrillators. However. Mari Ann was lucky that the Hampton Police Department had already purchased the device. Increasing the cost of defibrillators will make it more difficult for communities to make this lifesaving investment. We already have 6262defibrillator stations throughout the Capitol and the three Senate office buildings. So you and I are protected. but we are going to put a tax on them for the people in the rest of the country. It seems as though around here we have one set of morals and ethics for Capitol Hill and another set of morals and ethics for the rest of the country. Congress clearly understands why having so many of these devices. the importance of them and having them on hand to protect us and to protect our staffs and the million visitors who come to the Capitol. I made a motion that was objected to. so I cannot go through with that motion. My motion would have stopped this new Federal tax from increasing the cost of defibrillators and hurting the chances of placing the devices where they need to behopefully. within 5 minutes of people who need them. It is a disappointment my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would not allow that motion to go through. It is a sad state of affairs when the majority is not only blocking the offering of the motions and amendments that will improve the bill but also trying to ram through a bill before the American people even know what is in it. Yesterday. we heard things about Republicans having not offered amendments. There are 214 Republican amendments at the desk. One would think we would have a chance to offer more than a dozen or soI doubt it is even a dozen at this pointon a bill that is going to restructure onesixth of the economy.

But. .Mr. Speaker. my point would be the gentleman is trying to get into a political argument especially about how I may or may not have voted. He supposes I would have voted against the bill because it was a reasonable bill. I think that is what he is trying to say. I dont know how I voted on the bill. this section of the bill. at all. What I would say to you is that you cant have it both ways. You cant say Republicans did nothing and then say. oh. Republicans. a handful of Republicans did something. but the vast majority of Republicans voted against it. That is. Mr. Speaker. trying to take what we are attempting to do here today. making public policy wise choices in the open. and by the way. Republicans are for doing this on the floor to talk about every amendment. to talk about the processes. to talk about the expectations of performance. to talk about what we expect the laws to do. and now he is trying to have it both ways to say. I guess it was a Republican idea. but most Republicans opposed it. It was a Republican idea by the ranking member of Financial Services. SPENCER BACHUS. who is a Republican. and who moved forth in those responsibilities an opportunity for something to become law. And it Is obvious the gentleman. Mr. FRANK. at the time was willing to engage in that. and that should make all of us feel good. But I dont think we should turn around later and diminish that effort just because we want to make political points here today. And I dont mind making political points because here are the political points I would make: today we are going to narrow choices. lessen credit. and increase costs for borrowers and taxpayers. We are going to provide at a time when our country should be trying to lessen spending of money. we are going to provide an extra $140 million for people to go sue in court to overloaa our courts when resolution should be done by the legislation. but in fact also by the rules that are already provided by the Federal Reserve. Republicans arent here just to say no and to come to fight. We are after good public policy. We are after public policy that will work for people and a marketplace so there are lenders in every single community. This bill that we are here today on will lessen. take awaythe number of qualified lenders who are available because now the costs are going to go up. fewer consumers will be able to get the loans and will pay more money because now we are going to give from the Federal Government $140 million to go sue somebody. Legislation should be about finding a balance. Im not opposed to remedies. In not opposed to courts and people litigating for the right reasons. I am. simply not interested in now that itis over. trying to find a way to beat up people when resolution. keeping people in their homes. finding a way for that balance to work.

1110072494,I thank the gentleman from Ohio. And the consequence of what the gentleman from Ohio pointed out is illustrated in this chart. Here is the Federal budget deficit when we began as Members of Congress. The budget when we came in had a $459 billion deficit. or just under halfatrilliondollar deficit. But since weve been here. this amount of roughly half a trillion has been increased by almost a trillion. 950 billion in increases from 2008. for a total of over $1.4 trillion in deficits. Now. how did we get there? Three hundred twenty billion dollars of that. roughly. is from lower tax receipts due to the recession. Thats the roughly 27 million Americans who are either unemployed or underemployed. and theyre paying less in taxes. as are businesses and as are our families. So were experiencing lower tax receipts because of our recession. In addition. the stimulus bill has added $200 billion to our deficit for this year alone. half in spending and half in lower taxes. Then. an additional $154 billion for bailouts for financial institutions and the auto industry. $91 billion in bailouts for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Those. of course. are the GMAs that do housing programs. Seventythree million dollars in unemployment benefits due to the recession. again. associated with this loss in tax revenue due to the fact that so many Americans are unemployed and the fact that the stimulus dollars that we spent were not adequately weighted towards infrastructure construction like was the bill that Mr. AUSTRIA and Mr. LANCE and I cosponsored at the beginning of this year. And then $112 billion in other accumulated bills throughout the course of this year has gotten us to this point. $1.4 trillion in deficit.

1110020451,"Mr. President. I would like to take a minute to briefly discuss my opposition to the nomination of David Ogden to be Deputy Attorney General of the United States. First. however. I would like to take a minute to respond to allegations made yesterday by Senator LEAHY. who criticized the ""undue delay"" of David Ogdens nomination and further stated that ""It was disturbing to see that the presidents nominee of Mr. Ogden to this critical national security post was held up this -long by Senate Republicans apparently on some kind of a partisan whim."" There was no such delay. I would like to set the record straight on the Senates prompt consideration of this nominee. President Obama announced. Mr. Ogdens nomination on January 5. but the Judiciary Committee did not receive his nomination materials until January 23. and he was not officially nominated until January 26. The committee promptly held a hearing on his nomination on February 5. just 13 days after receiving his nbmination materials. His hearing record was opdn for written questions for 1 week. until February 12. and Mr. Ogden returned his responses on February 18 and 19. Following Mr. Ogdens hearing. the Judiciary Committee received an unprecedented number of opposition phone calls and letters for a Department of Justice nominee. In total. the committee has received over 11.000 contacts in opposition to his nomination. Despite this overwhelming opposition. the committee promptly voted on Mr. Ogdens nomination on February 26. I would note that the week prior to the committees vote on Mr. Ogdens nomination was a recess week and was the same week the committee received Mr. Ogdens answers to his written questions. Per standard practice. the committee could not have voted on him prior to February 26 because the record was not complete. Rather than hold this controversial nomination over for a week in committee. which is any Senators right. Republicans voted on Mr. Ogdens nomination the first time he was listed. on February 26. Five of the eight committee Republicans voted against his nomination. a strong showing of the concern over Mr. Ogdens nomination. And now. just 45 days after Mr. Ogden was nominated and despite significant opposition. the Senate is poised to vote on his confirmation. Even giving Democrats the benefit of the doubt and allowing that Mr. Ogdens nomination was announced on January 5. 66 days ago. the Senate is still acting as quickly as it has on past Deputy Attorney General. DAG. nominees. On average since 1980. Senators have been afforded 65 days to evaluate DAG nominees. Further. Senators were afforded 85 days to evaluate the nomination of Larry Thompson. President Bushs first DAG nominee and 110 days to evaluate the nomination of Mark Filip. Yesterday. Senator Leahy said he had ""urged"" the ""fast and complete confirmation"" of Mark Filip and that ""he was."" If 110 days was a ""fast"" confirmation. then how is 66 days an ""undue delay?"" In short. I take issue with the chairmans characterization of any ""undue delay"" on this nomination. As a member who shares the concerns of the thousands of individuals who have called the committee. I would now like to explain my opposition to David Ogdens nomination to be Deputy Attorney General. If confirmed. Mr. Ogden would be the secondhighest ranking official in the Department of Justice. The Deputy Attorney General possesses ""all the power and authority of the Attorney Math..42. 2009 General.. unless any such power or authoritY is required by law to be exercised by the Attorney General personally."" He supervises and directs all organizational units of the Department. and aides the Attorney General in developing and implementing Departmental policies and programs. To say the least. this is an important position. America is entitled to the most qualified and judicious person to fill such a crucial role. My concern is that David Ogden falls short of those expectations. Mr. Ogden is undoubtedly a bright and accomplished attorney. Although he lacks criminal trial experience that would be helpful in overseeing DOJ components such as the Criminal Division. National Security Division. U.S. Attorneys Offices. FBI. and DEA. it appears he is fit to serve as Deputy Attorney General. My concern is with his views on some of the most important issues within the Departments purview. During Mr. Ogdens time as an attorney in private practice. he vigorously defended very sensitive and controversial issues such as abortion. pornography. the incorporation of international law in Constitutional interpretation. and the unconstitutionality of the death penalty for minors. While I recognize that lawyers should not necessarily be impugned for the views of their clients. I am particularly concerned about a pattern in Mr. Ogdens representations. namely his work on obscenity and pornography litigation. In these cases. Mr. Ogden has consistently argued the side of the pornography producers. opposing legislation designed to ban child pornography. including the Childrens Internet Protection Act of 2000 and the Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act of 1998. At his hearing and in response to written questions. Mr. Ogden maintained that the views he adv ocated in these cases were those of his client. and not necessarily his own. While I accept this as plausible. I am unsatisfied with Mr. Ogdens unwillingness to answer my specific questions about his own personal beliefs. Discerning such personal views is crucial to adequately evaluating a nominee who may be charged with enforcing the very laws he has opposed in the past. It would not have been hard for Mr. Ogden to distance himself from some of the extreme views he advanced on behalf of his clients. For example. in his brief for the American Psychological Association in Casey v. Planned Parenthood. he wrote: it is grossly misleading to tell a woman that abortion imposes possible detrimental psychological effects when the risks are negligible in most cases. when the evidence shows that she is more likely to experience feelings of relief and happiness. and when childbirth and childrearing or adoption may pose concomitant (if not greater) risks of adverse psychological effects for some women depending on their individual circumstances. I was disappointedand somewhat shockedthat. given an opportunity to respond to such a statement. the best Mr. Ogden could offer was further clarification that he was representing the views of client. When pressed for his personal views on the matter. he refused to answer. As a result. I am left to guess at what this nominees views are on a matter of critical importance. Similarly. I asked Mr. Ogden whether he believes that adult obscenity contributes to the sexual exploitation of children in any way. Further. I asked him whether he personally believes that adult obscenity contributes to the demand for prostitutes. and/or women and children who are trafficked into prostitution. His curt response was the same for both questions: ""I have not studied this issue and therefore do not have a personal belief."" It is hard to believe that a lawyer who devoted significant time and energy throughout his career to representing the pornography industry would not have an opinion on these issues. In response to my question about whether he personally believes there is a Federal constitutional right to samesex marriage. he replied: ""I have not studied this issue and therefore have not developed a personal view as to whether there is a constitutional right to samesex marriage."" I simply find it hard to believe that a lawyer of the caliber and experience possessed by David Ogden has not thought about matters of such widespread public debate. In short. although I am impressed by Mr. Ogdens credentials. his lack of candor in response to my questions leaves me guessing about the approach he will take to these and other sensitive issues at the Department of Justice. While former clients or advocacy should not necessarily disqualify a lawyer from such positions. David Ogden did not do enough to distance himself from controversial views he advocated in the past. often against the interests of the government. Therefore. Mr. Ogdens performance throughout this nomination process is not enough to overcome the unfortunate presumptions created by his record of representation: I am unable to support his nomination.",111117571,COBURN,THOMAS,S,OK,M,R,,voting,2009-03-12,51,Mr. COBURN,2852,3100,03122009.txt,8394,1356,111,2009,mr presid would like take minut briefli discuss opposit nomin david ogden

1110050035,Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to join colleagues here today in offering condolences to the families and friends and coworkers of Barbara McLean Spears. Louis Junior Watson and Rachel Mae Poston Pulley. the three workers who tragically lost their lives in an explosion at the ConAgra plant in Garner. North Carolina on June 9. This area. Garner. North Carolina. is an area that I formerly represented as their Congressman. Its now represented by our colleague. BOB ETHERIDGE. and I want to thank BOB for sponsoring this resolution here today and enabling us to come together in this time of tribute. Our sympathy goes out to the families of the victims. but also to the 40 other.ConAgra employees who were injured in this plants explosion and collapse. Some of them have severe burns. They have other *serious injuries. We wish them a successful recovery. and we thank .the medical providers. including the Burn Center at UNC Chapel Hill. who are doing so much to treat these victims. Often it does take a tragedy like the ConAgra explosion to publicly highlight the courageous Work of our first responders. We commend those who responded to this explosion. There are many stories of bravery that prevented further injury or loss of life. The firefighters. the police. the emergency medical services of Garner and Wake County and many surrounding communities that heeded the call to rescue the ConAgra plant employees in a quick and safe manner. So were very indebted to them and grateful to them. -These first responders put us first. put our communities first every day. There are also many private citizens who risked their lives helping plant employees evacuate. who gave selfless assistance to their suffering neighbors. Thats a testament to the character and the strength of Garners community. The ConAgra plant. as my colleague. Mr. ETHERIDGE. has said. is a cornerstone of the Garner and Wake County community. It was built as a sausage plant nearly 50 years ago. As we move forward. remembering the victims of this tragedy. and the way that this plant provided the livelihood for so many people. we do hope the plant is rebuilt. and that employees can return to work. And were heartened that such plans seem to be under way. We do need to remain vigilant. of course. in our efforts to improve workplace safety. The Bureau of Alcohol. Tobacco and Firearms has concluded their investigation. finding. fortunately. no evidence of criminal intent. The Chemical Safety Board investigation is ongoing. We need to get to the bottom of this. We need to understand what happened. and we need. of course. to adopt practices and policies that lead to safer facilities in the future and avoid this kind of tragedy. So. Mr. Speaker. in closing. we honor the memories of those that we have lost. give thanks for those who have been spared. and join in sympathy for the victims and their families.,111120900,PRICE,DAVID,H,NC,M,D,4,voting,2009-06-15,286,Mr. PRICE of North Carolina,17034,17116,06152009.txt,2886,488,111,2009,mr speaker pleas join colleagu today offer condol famili friend cowork barbara mclean spear loui junior watson rachel mae poston pulley three worker tragic lost live explos conagra plant garner north carolina june area garner north carolina area formerli repres congressman repres colleagu bob etheridg want thank bob sponsor resolut today enabl us come togeth time tribut sympathi goe famili victim also employe injur plant explos collaps sever burn seriou injuri wish success recoveri thank medic provid includ burn center unc chapel hill much treat victim often take tragedi like conagra explos publicli highlight courag work first respond commend respond explos mani stori braveri prevent injuri loss life firefight polic emerg medic servic garner wake counti mani surround commun heed call rescu conagra plant employe quick safe manner indebt grate first respond put us first put commun first everi day also mani privat citizen risk live help plant employe evacu gave selfless assist suffer neighbor that testament charact strength garner commun conagra plant colleagu mr etheridg said cornerston garner wake counti commun built sausag plant nearli year ago move forward rememb victim tragedi way plant provid livelihood mani peopl hope plant rebuilt employe return work hearten plan seem way need remain vigil cours effort improv workplac safeti bureau alcohol tobacco firearm conclud investig find fortun evid crimin intent chemic safeti board investig ongo need get bottom need understand happen need cours adopt practic polici lead safer facil futur avoid kind tragedi mr speaker close honor memori lost give thank spare join sympathi victim famili,255,FALSE

Founded in 1997 by veteran TV journalist. Jennifer Valoppi. and Telemundo President Don Browne. the program has been a pioneer institution for inspiring atrisk young women to achieve their fullest potential through education and job training. The participants of the Women of Tomorrow program receive mentoring and guidance from highly accomplished professional women in our community. These women share their experiences and techniques for achieving academic and professional success. and their efforts bear fruit. as the high school graduation rate of Women of Tomorrow participants is 90 percent. well over the national average. Thanks to the Women of Tomorrow organization. under the leadership of its executive director. Bianca Erickson. countless atrisk teenagers are given the encouragement to dream big for the future. Nearly all of the programs high school graduates pursue a college education.

1110035415,"I thank the gentleman from Texas for his leadership in opposition to this issue and for yielding. The gentleman. the previous speaker. just said this bill only punishes violent crimes. I take you to the language from the bill. Heres the definition of a crime of violence. It means an offense that has. as an element. the threatened use of force against the property of another. If one threatens to use force against the property of anotherthis is verbatim from the section that is referenced in the existing codeproperty crimes are included in this. threats against property crimes are included in this. Hate crimes. the definition of hate crinfies in the Federal statutes means a crime when the perpetrator selects property because of the property owners actual or perceived sexual orientation. This isnt just violent crimes. It is in some of the Federal segment of it but not in the assistance that goes to local governments. And in local governments it also states in the bill that any local jurisdictions hate crimes ordinance or legislation can be supported by supporting the prosecution of the local hate crimes legislation thats there. And so whatever local jurisdiction may determine is a hate crime is covered under this bill. It might be a city. a county. a municipality. it might be a parish. it might be a State. It might be San Franciscos ordinance that says. Thou shalt not discriminate against the short. the fat. the tall. or the skinny. That is hate crimes ordinances that could be prosecuted with Federal assistance under this bill. The short. the fat. the tall. the skinny. That will cover some regular people. I think. And so I would ask this: Why are you dividing us? Why are you pitting Americans against Americans? Thats a rhetorical question. Mr. Speaker. This divides us and pits Americans against Americans. And the definitions in this bill are broad. ambiguous and undefined anywhere with any consensus. even among the professionals that deal with this on a daily basis. In the committee. I asked specifically the question. ""What is the definition for sexual orientation?"" The answer that I got back from the gentlelady from Wisconsin was. ""This bill only covers homosexuality and heterosexuality."" Now it presumably excludes bisexuality. but in the rule debate. the gentleman from Florida said. ""No. no. Heres what we have."" and he read through a whole list of philias. he called it. There are 547 specific paraphilias that are listed by the American Psychological Association. About 30 of them have been read into this RECORD. Ive got a list of these 30 philias. Among them pedophiliathe obsession with childrenwhich specifically was excluded from the bill when I offered the amendment by the Judiciary Committee. So. Mr. Speaker. were going down the path here of no one really knows. Am I going to buy into the statement made by the very senior member of the Rules Committee who says I want to protect all philias whatsoever no -matter what the proclivity? And many of them are perversions. Mr. Speaker. Were going to grant that protected status to people who are actually breaking the law if they act on their particular sexual orientation. or are we going to limit it toas the gentlelady from Wisconsin sayshomosexuality and heterosexuality. not bisexuality. I tried to explain this to the press as they asked me questions. And finally my answer became. ""If this sounds confusing and gibberish. it is."" And it leaves it open to any judge. any lawyer. anyone for anything that is in their head or might be their plumbing or might be in the perception of the perpetrator as well as. andor. the perception of the alleged victim. There is no precedent for this in law. this broad. broad idea that were going to punish what is in the head of the perpetrator by dividing what may or may not have been in the head of the victim.

1110006662,Mr. Chair. as a member of the Ways and Means Committee. I support the inclusion of the comparative effectiveness provision in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services. such as the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality. are already underaking comparative e ffp.ctiveness research under a 2003 provision. The Department has worked diligently to conduct research that meets the priorities and requests of the Medicare. Medicaid and SCHIP programs. but its resources are too limited to conduct the types of comparative clinical effectiveness studies Americans need to improve the quality of health care they receive. This provision would expand on the 2003 directive to move these efforts forward in a way that generates necessary information for health care providers to ensure patients receive the best care possible. This provision could help the United States begin to address significant health problems. such as the type2 diabetes epidemic. In New Jersey. over 400.000 people have been diagnosed with diabetes. Even more alarming. an additional 178.000 residents have the disease but are unaware of it. It is a sad truth that. in New Jersey. diabetes is no longer a rare condition and indeed has a significant and growing impact on the health o~f my constituents. Of course. this epidemic is not confined to New Jersey alone. In the United States. there are over 20 million individuals with type2 diabetes. approximately 6 million of which are over age 65. Between 80 to 90 percent of patients diagnosed with type2 diabetes are also overweight. This provision would ensure that the Department of Health and Human Services will now have the resources to conduct research comparing treatments that emphasize weight loss and glycemic control to those that emphasize glycemic control alone. Studies like this would generate the information necessary to. move the diabetes care paradigm from subjective recommendations to evidencebased medicine that would improve the care of all patients with type2 diabetes. This is just one example of the promise that comparative effectiveness research holds. Additional studies would help identify the most effective treatments for other serious health conditions. Because of the promise of comparative effectiveness research and the opportunity it holds for improving the health of all Americans. Mr. Chair. I support the provision and the underlying bill.,111120740,PASCRELL,BILL,H,NJ,M,D,8,voting,2009-01-28,588,Mr. PASCRELL,24284,24344,01282009.txt,2461,382,111,2009,mr chair member way mean committe support inclus compar effect provis american recoveri reinvest act agenc within depart health human servic agenc health care research qualiti alreadi compar research provis depart work dilig conduct research meet prioriti request medicar medicaid schip program resourc limit conduct type compar clinic effect studi american need improv qualiti health care receiv provis would expand direct move effort forward way gener necessari inform health care provid ensur patient receiv best care possibl provis could help unit state begin address signific health problem type diabet epidem new jersey peopl diagnos diabet even alarm addit resid diseas unawar sad truth new jersey diabet longer rare condit inde signific grow impact health constitu cours epidem confin new jersey alon unit state million individu type diabet approxim million age percent patient diagnos type diabet also overweight provis would ensur depart health human servic resourc conduct research compar treatment emphas weight loss control emphas control alon studi like would gener inform necessari move diabet care paradigm subject recommend evidencebas medicin would improv care patient type diabet one exampl promis compar effect research hold addit studi would help identifi effect treatment seriou health condit promis compar effect research opportun hold improv health american mr chair support provis underli bill,213,FALSE
1110004488,Mr. President. today is a sad day. We had a wonderful inauguration a couple of days ago. phenomenal crowd. a great celebration. and a peaceful transfer of power took place. It was amazing. I was there on the front steps of the Capitol watching it. participating in it. excited about the first AfricanAmerican President of the United States. an amazing thing to take place within one generation of Martin Luther Kings marches and what he did in this country. My State has been a big part of all of those things and what has taken place. Today is a sad day. though. Today. 36 years ago. the Supreme Courts ruling in Roe v. Wade banned all impediments to having an abortion in the United States and said abortion is a constitutional right that the individual carries in the United States and that it cannot be infringed upon. cannot be limited. It did later limit some of that and gave a few places where the State could act to limitmost recently partialbirth abortions. where the Supreme Court has recently ruled that the State can limit partialbirth abortions. And there were a few minor areas in the Roe decision. but overall it made a constitutional right to .abortion. That was 36 years ago. The reason I say it is a sad day is there have been roughlyand nobody knows for sure40 million children who are not here today because of that decision. It ratcheted up. escalated up substantially the number of abortions in the United States that took place after that. It moved forward to the point that most estimates are that one in four pregnancies in the United States will end in an abortion and a child dying. And it even gets worse from that point. When you look at children with special needs. such as Down syndrome children. the number is somewhere between 80 to 90 percent do not make it here. as I have stated on this floor previously. as they are aborted and they are killed because of their genetic type. They get a test. the amniocentesis test. which says they have an extra chromosome. and generally because of that extra chromosome they are aborted and they are killed. even though the fact is. if they would get here on the ground. life and the prospects for a Down syndrome child now have never been better. Life expectancy. quality of life issues. if that is your measure. have never been better than they are now. Plus. the families who have a Down syndrome child look at those children as the centerpiece of the family. an amazing person. Yet somewhere between 80 to 90 percent of these amazing people never make it here. and that is because of what happened 36 years ago this day in the Supreme Court of the United States. That is why there will be hundreds of thousands. piiraily youn4 reople. marching today in Washinaton. DC. TLey will _ru* ro mprntion. Thre xi.! he very little press. if any. outside of some of the religious press that will be there. But outside of that. they will get virtually no coverage. There will be hundreds of thousands of young people here marching and asking for a change and something different. something that I hope President Barack Obama would embrace. He was empowered on the legs of young people and young enthusiastic minds looking for change. looking for something different. That same young generation is the most prolife demographic in our country today. That age group that is below the age of 25 is the most pro life. They are looking for something different. They are looking for a sanctity of life. They are looking for us to protect all innocent human life. They are looking for us to work to make all human life better. whether that is a child in the womb or a child in Darfur. Whether it is somebody in prison or somebody in poverty. they want that persons life to be better. That is a beautiful prolife statement. It is one that we need to see mirrored. It is one we need to see acted upon. It is one we need to see happen. rather than the repealing of things such as Mexico City language which says we can now use taxpayer dollars to fund groups overseas that work and support and fund abortion. Yet apparently that is what the Obama administration is going to do. it is going to repeal Mexico City language and say that taxpayer dollars can now be used for these purposes that most Americans disagree with. That is not the change people are looking for. Those are chains to the past. Those are things that bind us to a culture that doesnt affirm life. that doesnt see it as sacred and beautiful in all its places and dignity in every human life no matter who it is. Those are ones that say quality of life is your measure. as to whether you should be the recipient of such a gift of life. It is a sad day. It is a tough day. I hope it is a day that doesnt go on as far as our having many future annual recognitions of the Roe v. Wade decision but. rather that in the future we will be a lifeaffirming place and that we will say. in a dignified culture every life at every place in every way is beautiful and it is unique and it is amazing and it is something that should be celebrated and it should not be killed. When we move to that. that will be real change. That is the sort of change that people can look at and say. that is what I want my country to be like. You know. the sadness doesnt stop with the death of the children. We are now seeing more and more studies coming out about the impact on people who have abortions. In August this past year. 100 scientists. medical and mental health professionals. released a joint statement that abortion does indeed hurt women. The Supreme Court aJ the United States concluded sbme women do regret their abortions and ern .iffe- sverc repeson onr lums o selfesteem. These professionals have officially confirmed these facts. They say the number of women adversely affected by abortions cannot be overlooked by the medical community. In looking at this in our own family situation. every one of our children is incredibly precious. If I think of one of them not being there. it is one of those stunning sort of thoughts of despair. and yet to think of the 40 million who arent here and of the stunning amount of despair there must be in a number of peoples lives and hearts as they think. I made that decision fast. or I did that under a lot of pressure. or I didnt think I had another choice. But other choices did exist. People want to adopt. and people want to adopt Down syndrome children. As TED KENNEDY and I recognized. in my bill we got passed last year on prenatally and postnatally diagnosed diseases. which established a list of people who wanted to adopt Down syndrome children or children with- special needssome people look at a child in that situation and say. I cant handle that. and I understand. But there are people who believe they can handle it and they want to take a child and raise it. So I hope as we look forward. we will work together and say. this is something that shouldnt be happening the way it is in the United States and we want to make it different. I hope we will recognize these young people who are marching out here now. who are hoping for change. and understand the change they want is quite valuable. it is beautiful. it is life affirming. and that ultimately it is going to happen.

1110071509,"Madam Speaker. earlier this year. I introduced H.R. 2392. the ""Government Information Transparency Act."" to make federal reporting of taxpayer dollars more accessible to the American people. In Committee. Chairman EDOLPHUS TOWNS and I were able to work on a bipartisan basis to get key provisions of this legislation into S. 303. which is now under consideration by the House. The Government Information Transparency Act instructs the Office of Management and Budget to designate a single data standard for the collection. analysis. and dissemination of business and financial information required to be reported to the federal government. The federal government mandates disclosure of large amounts of information: financial filings by public companies. call reports by financial institutions. various disclosures by federal contractors. reports by recipients of taxpayerfunded grant money. and the list goes on. Too often. these disclosures are in formats that dont permit electronic searches and comparisons. Some disclosures. in fact. are still made using paper. Moreover. the formats vary from agency to agency. and even within agencies. Unwieldy and incompatible data formats make reported information much less useful than it could be. Even worse. it creates complex and overlapping layers of reporting that serve as the breeding ground for wasteful government. Information reported to the federal government needs to become both fully searchable and fully standardized. Modern information technology can bridge these two gaps. An interactive data standard that relies on electronic tags to individually identify each element of information can render every piece of data separately readable by software. This interactivity allows the creation of databases that are far more useful than sequential. plaintext financial reports. And if the same standard were applied to every federal agencys disclosure programssecurities. banking. grants. contracts. and so onunprecedented searches and comparisons would become possible. So. the Government Information Transparency Act requires the OMB to set up a single interactive data standard for reported informationa standardized. universal. and machinereadable format that will be made available to the general public. The use of a single data standard will still allow agencies to be flexible in how they require information to be submitted. Sophisticated companies might be asked to submit large data files. small companies and nonprofits could fill in Webbased forms that would automatically encode each element on their reports. The result: every report would be computerreadable. and the underlying data could be more easily extracted. searched. and analyzed. Financial and business information in a uniform format will be more transparent. and thus more accessible for public critique. Fraudulent transactions and irresponsible risktaking can be more easily detected. search costs are reduced. and companies will be put under greater pressure to explain the underpinnings of the financial statements they release. Instead of assigning an immense oversight responsibility to a handful of federal employees. we can now enable the public to act as citizenregulators. And because information reported to different agencies will become compatible. investors. watchdog groups. and analysts will have powerful new searches at their disposal. The Government Information Transparency Act also requires a single data standard for federal financial information. to bring the same interactivity and compatibility to the disclosures put out by federal agencies. By making this kind of information more accessible to the general public. we are unleashing the very best government watchdogsthe American people themselvesto expose waste. fraud. and abuse of their tax dollars. For business and financial information. the sunlight of transparency has always been the best disinfectant. Our Government Information Transparency Act. added to S. 303. will make that sunlight brighter and clearer than ever.",111119910,ISSA,DARRELL,H,CA,M,R,49,voting,2009-12-14,46,Mr. ISSA,2370,2480,12142009.txt,4040,589,111,2009,madam speaker earlier year introduc hr govern inform transpar act make feder report taxpay dollar access american peopl committe chairman edolphu town abl work bipartisan basi get key provis legisl consider hous govern inform transpar act instruct offic manag budget design singl data standard collect analysi dissemin busi financi inform requir report feder govern feder govern mandat disclosur larg amount inform financi file public compani call report financi institut variou disclosur feder contractor report recipi taxpayerfund grant money list goe often disclosur format dont permit electron search comparison disclosur fact still made use paper moreov format vari agenc agenc even within agenc unwieldi incompat data format make report inform much less use could even wors creat complex overlap layer report serv breed ground wast govern inform report feder govern need becom fulli searchabl fulli standard modern inform technolog bridg two gap interact data standard reli electron tag individu identifi element inform render everi piec data separ readabl softwar interact allow creation databas far use sequenti plaintext financi report standard appli everi feder agenc disclosur bank grant contract search comparison would becom possibl govern inform transpar act requir omb set singl interact data standard report informationa standard univers machineread format made avail gener public use singl data standard still allow agenc flexibl requir inform submit sophist compani might ask submit larg data file small compani nonprofit could fill webbas form would automat encod element report result everi report would underli data could easili extract search analyz financi busi inform uniform format transpar thu access public critiqu fraudul transact irrespons risktak easili detect search cost reduc compani put greater pressur explain underpin financi statement releas instead assign immens oversight respons hand feder employe enabl public act inform report differ agenc becom compat investor watchdog group analyst power new search dispos govern inform transpar act also requir singl data standard feder financi inform bring interact compat disclosur put feder agenc make kind inform access gener public unleash best govern american peopl themselvesto expos wast fraud abus tax dollar busi financi inform sunlight transpar alway best disinfect govern inform transpar act ad make sunlight brighter clearer ever,358,FALSE
1110008915,Madam Speaker. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. On the debate before us today. this has been a discussion that has been going on in the country for 3 years now. Jt was mentioned earlier that there were people who didnt know that this date was pending. I dont know how you *could possibly be watching television and not know that this date was coming up. This has been the most broadcast. the most communicated date in the history of broadcasting. And if you dont know that this date is coming up. youre probably not watching television. And if youre not watching television. you probably wont know on February 18 whether it occurred or not. There are really three important reasons not to pass this rule and not to pass this bill. One is first responders. The 9/11 . Commission. in discussion after discussion since then and before then. has talked about getting all of our first responders on one level where they could communicate. All you have to do is have a flood. a tornado or an ice storm in your area to know that when the first responders come in to help. no matter how well your own first responders are communicating. when the first responders come in to help. they could be much more helpful if they could all communicate together immediately. And they cannot do that until the last person gets off the spectrum that is allocated to them. Many of them are ready to do it on February 18. Others might be on March 1. But it doesnt matter. Were saying they cant communicate because were not going to take people off the spectrum. Also. is a 3year plan better than a 115day plan? The truth is. my friends. the people who win today. and I assume the majority will win since they had a majority of votes on suspension. the people who win will lose this argument in midJune. In midJune. there will be problems. just like there will be a few problems on February 18. In my district. the speculation is 99 percent of the people are ready for this transition. The original bill said that we. would automatically make the transition when 85 percent were ready. The number was used a minute ago that 95 percent are ready in the whole country now. There are going to be problems in midJune. And some of these problems are going to be because of what we do here today. There have been people contracted for 2 years. in some cases almost 3 years. to come in on February 17. to be there until a time certain on February 18. to make this transition happen. Those same people arent going to be available to be contracted for whatever this day is in June. And of course the third reason is we sold the spectrum. I was originally skeptical. I thought. well. maybe we should keep the spectrum longer so it gets worth more.

1110050860,I think correctly. said both sides like notice of actions that are to be taken on the floor. In fact. when we take notice. when we do less than 24 hours. you rightfully believe thats inappropriate. I agree with you on that. and we try to do that. Sometimes we dont make it. . E 2115 But the fact is that this. is not as if we havent had some discussions over at least the last 2 months about this issue. And from my perspectiveI dont want to speak for Mr. OBEY. who has spoken with Mr. LEWIS as wellbut over the last t months I have seen nothing that indicated to me that time constraints would be agreeable to your side of the aisle. not from you. not from Mr. BOEHNER. not from anybody else. not from Mr. LEWIS. who on this floor just hours ago indicated that there would not be any time agreements possible. So in that context. I am in a position where. if thats the caseand you may well be correct that 127 wouldnt be offered. but very frankly. our experience in 2007now. -in 2008. the appropriation process was attenuated. as you know. It upset you and disappointed me that we didnt have bills. The reasons for that. obviously. dealt with mainly the Appropriations Committee fighting about energy. as you know. One can blame one another for that. but in any event. it didnt go forward. Nobody was pleased that we didnt consider the bills individually. and we ended up. as you well know. earlier this year doing an omnibus appropriation bill. We did omnibus appropriation bills frequently when you were in charge of the House. as well. Neither side liked that then or when we did it. So I tell my friend. the intention is going to be to try to construct time framesand we would be glad to have further discussions with you on thosewhich will allow for these 12 bills to be done in the time available to us between now and July 30. Because if we dont get them done. I guarantee you that when we get back in September. with 21 days left to go. we will not be able to conference these bills and get them done.

1110028484,"The reason we wanted to be extraordinarily thoughtful is that we knew these questions would be asked. but let me tell you the simplicity of what this legislation speaks to: At the same time. let me go on record. Congresswoman JACKSONLEE from Houston. Texas: I am in support of tile Nations financial markets. investment houses. They have been at our back for a number of years. They have invested your moneys. your 401(k)s. Capitalism has. in fact. worked. but abuse does not work. so we speak today about abuse. not about crumbling the financial houses. the investment houses. We want them to be strengthened. Young people every day are graduating from college and are saying. ""I want to be an investment banker."" They want to help grow the economy. We are not unsupportive of that. In fact. in my own congressional district. it used to be American General. I have AIG employees. I applaud them. They come up to me on the street. I want them to know I appreciate their work in the insurance businessin protecting and in insuring everything from whistles. to haystacks. to Hollywood actors. to the transportation modes that you travel onbut we have got tobe able to protect your tax dollars. Let me tell you why this bill works. Attorney General Cuomo made it work. He issued subpoenas. What do we get? Some $50 billion backand more growingfrom AIG. It shows that the long hand of the law can be effective. The $160 billion given to executives is more than most Americans will see ever in their lifetimes. This is. a simple response to it. What it does is it allows the Attorney General to recover prior excessive payments to employees made by the company. It allows the government. as a creditor. to show that the excessive payments that were made have no bearing on the work. It is permissive. It allows. It does not suggest that. in fact. there is a coup detat. that the Attorney General can do it without any oversight. E 1315 They must go into court. That makes a difference. The judge must ultimately say. You know what? I agree with the petitioner/the attorney general/the government as creditor or I disagree. Second. it allows the Attorney General to limit payments to company executives to 10 times the average nonpayment wages just as it would have been if the case was forced into bankruptcy. This is a fair assessment if a company has taken Federal dollars. and $700 billion given to these companies in October of 2008. Most of them bought up your baby banks. not put that money out to help Americans. So Mr. Speaker. I think what is key here is that this is reasonable. We have constitutional scholars who have indicated .that you are within the constitutional framework. Why would the Judiciary Committee want to eliminate those barriers. And then secondly and thirdly. we thank the employees that are doing their job every day trying to make this economy work. But what we say to the taxpayers is. if there is ever a committee that has to play the enforcement role to enhance the Constitution. to gather in those who have gone outside the boundaries of reason. who are abusive in issuing moneys to people who are part of the problem. it is the Judiciary Committee. and the Attorney General that complements the work of the Secretary of the Treasury. and our very able leader in the White House. who is constructively trying to put this capitalistic system back on its feet. Then it has to be those of us with the responsibility of enforcement to ensure that we provide the coverage for taxpayers who cannot speak for themselves. I rise enthusiastically to support H.R. 1575 for the very reason that we will be derelict if this committee. the holders of the Constitution. did not come to the floor and provide this thoughtful legislation that provides you with the protection of evidence that you have alrdady seen in the moneys that have been returned under the New York State Attorney General. Imagine the wielding of that action on behalf of all of the people of the United States. Support H.R. 1575. Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support ofH.R. 1575. the ""End Government Reimbursement of Excessive Disbursements (End Greed) Act."" I want to thank my colleague Congressman JOHN CONYERS.

1110074206,Mr. President. before he leaves the floor. I commend the distinguished Senator from Illinois for his statement and want to make sure the body recognizes that it has been Senator SANDERS who has championed this cause relentlessly. making the case that. dollar for dollar. there is no better investment in American health care than these community health centers. I was going to spend my time talking about the opportunities for Democrats and Republicans to continue to team up on this health reform issue. I think it is worth noting that Senator SANDERS. who has championed this effort in this bill. is actually picking up on work that a number of the most influential Republicans in this country have been interested in for years. President George W. Bush was a great champion of community health centers. BERNIE SANDERS. now in this bill. is making sure we get a very significant increase so that there will be many new clinics across the country. There are opportunities for Democrats and Republicans to work together. I will talk about a way we can create a new marketplace in American health care through health care exchanges and get more value for the health care dollar. This is an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to team up. much like with community health centers. I thank my colleague. I know because of our work together on health legislation the Senator shares my view that we can continue this effort to bring the Senate together on both sides around key principles of health reform. I want to do that again this morning by focusing on one of the most transformational and least understood parts of the health care debate. that is. the question of health insurance exchanges. My guess is across the country people are still trying to figure out what in the world these are and whether this is yet some other kind of health care lingo. It is fair to say. in basic English. these exchanges will be like farmers markets. This will be an opportunity for people to go to one place and to do what they cant do in the dysfunctional American health care system today. that is. actually shop and be in a position to compare various kinds of products and services. When you invest wisely. you can put the savings in your pocket. The reality is. that has not been possible in our country ever since the middle of the 1940s. During the 1940s. when there were wage and price controls. judgments were made about the delivery of American health care. The decision to tie insurance to someones job made sense back then. when people went to work somewhere and stayed put for 30 years until their employer gave them a big retirement party and a gold watch. But todays economy is very different. On average. people change their jobs 11 times by the time they are 40. We need to make sure that no longer is the consumer insulated from the health care system. no longer are most consumers incapable of being rewarded when they shop wisely. People understand that they lose out in terms of their wages if health care costs continue to rise as a result of inefficiency. So these health insurance exchanges are the key to making health care markets work. in effect. for the first time since the middle of the last century. In the merged bill. Senator REID. in my view. has laid an important foundation. There are three fundamental principles in Senator REIDs merged bill. Of course. we are going to continue to work on this. When the managers. package and this bill get out of the Senate. we are going to be working on this for quite some time. We are going to work on this long after 24/7 cable TV has moved on to other topics. But in Senator REIDs merged bill. there are three important features of the exchange. The first is. it is going to be possible for consumers to make applestoapples comparisons of various health care plans. Consumers will be able to see that one plan will cost them $20 in copays for a physician visit. but perhaps another plan will cost them $30. It will be much like you can do in a store. a Costco. a grocery store. where consumers look at products on a shelf. look at the price. look at the various offerings. and choose the best product for themselves. The second feature in the merged bill that Democrats and Republicans alike should appreciate is that it will be possible to keep lowquality plans out of the new marketplaces. This is especially important at the outset. I learned this back in the days when I was codirector of the Oregon Gray Panthers. the senior citizens group. One of the things the country learned in the early days of Medicare is a lot of the policies that were sold to supplement Medicare were just junk. They were not worth the paper they were written on. and people would buy 10. 12. 15 policies. literally wasting money they could have used for food and fuel and paying the rent. It took us until the mid1990s to drain the swamp. and finally we were able to do it. standardize those packages. stop the ripoff of older people with products that literally were not worth the paper they were written on. The consumer protection provisions Senator REID has put in the merged bill. as it relates to exchanges. are going to keep lowquality plans out. This is going to offer customers the peace of mind of knowing that when they look at the plans. they can be certain they will have to meet minimum consumer protection standards. This is an important message to send in a new marketplace. and it will be an opportunity to have a very different start than we saw with Medicare. during those early days. when seniors were sold these policies to supplement their Medicare. private insurance policies that were a lot of junk. Finally. under the merged bill. you are going to be able to see the value you are getting for your health care dollar. in an important respect. through what are called loss ratios that insurance companies will have to make public. What this means. of course. is consumers want to know that when they put out a dollar for premiums. they will get a significant portion of that dollar back in actual benefits and services. With the exchange. it is going to be possible to finally get this kind of loss information in one place and make it public. So what I would like to do is talk about the steps from here and particularly build on principles the President talked to us about earlier this year in terms of ideas that bring Democrats and Republicans together. that is. more choice and more competition in the health care marketplace. What we are pointing to is the day when every consumer in America can say to their insurance company: I am giving you an ultimatum. You treat me right or I am taking my business elsewhere. That is what we are pointing to. Here are some of the steps it is going to take in the days ahead to build to that future. First. you have to have a big enough pool of people as soon as you can so as to maximize their clout in the marketplace. You have to make sure the exchanges are open to more than just folks who have been uninsured. If you open it just to folks who are uninsured. who have not seen a doctor. who have had chronic illnesses. who have not been able to get the preventive care they need. you have coming to the exchanges folks who are sicker and. of course. they are more expensive in terms of getting them good health care. and it is harder to hold down costs. Once you have a big enough pool. where the risk is spread across a large group of people who have a wide range of health risks. you will be in a better position to force the insurance companies to compete and drive down costs for everybody. In effect. in the days ahead. we will be in a position to put in place a cycle in the health care marketplace that will get more value for the American consumer. More and more people will come to the exchanges because the premiums are lower. More insurers will come into the exchange because they see that is the place you have to go in order to get business. Then you have what amounts to the beginnings of a revolution in the health care marketplace: get as many healthy people into the exchange. make it impossible for insurance companies to find loopholes and use slick marketing campaigns to cherrypick just the youngest and healthiest. force them to compete on the basis of price. benefit. and quality and then you are on your way to taking a dysfunctional American health care system and getting the choice and competition that will finally pay off for the American consumer. There are some additional interim steps I wish to mention briefly. The majority leader. Senator REID. and Chairman BAUCUS and I have come to an agreement that will also provide the opportunity to get more choice and more competition into the health care marketplace. What we have agreed to is. folks who spend more than 8 percent of their income on health care but are not eligible for subsidiesin effect. folks with what is called the hardship waiverthey would be able to get a voucher from their employer and go into the marketplace. With that kind of approach. which would be tax free to them. our estimate is that it will be less than onethird as expensive. in terms of getting health care for those folks. as the alternativethe system of subsidies. Again. we get more people covered in a more affordable way. building on these timehonored principles of choice and competition. Finally. Senator COLLINS. Senator BAYH. and I have a proposal. a proposal that has been endorsed by the National Federation of Independent Business. that would say that employers that are in the exchange can voluntarily say they want to give their workers more choices. In effect. it would say to those small employers in the exchange: You and your workers will have a choice to have a choice. No employer is required to do anything. But should they want to concentrate on making their widgets rather than being in the health insurance business. they would have the opportunity to do it. What they would give their worker would be tax free to the employer. tax free to the worker. Once again. you bring the principles of choice and competition into the health care marketplace and move us closer to that day when the consumer can give the insurance company the ultimatum I have envisioned. which is: Treat me right or I go elsewhere. I close by saying. in my view. the majority leader has laid the foundation for a new health care marketplace. I certainly would like to do more. As the distinguished Presiding Officer knows. as cosponsor of our bipartisan Healthy Americans Act. I would like to do more. and I would like to do it faster. But make no mistake about it. this is laying a foundation to create a new marketplace in American health care. where that concept has been foreign. To let people make applestoapples comparisons. keep crummy products out of the exchange. make sure people can get information about loss ratios. that is a real foundation. Then we seek to go further. We have had the counsel of some of the countrys leading thinkers about American health care. Lets get more healthy people into the exchanges. Lets make sure we have these big pools. Lets make sure the insurers cannot try to steer the marketplace because we know they are going to try. in ingenious ways through advertising and market promotion strategies. to still find the best risks. Lets build on what Senator REID has laid out with respect to the exchanges in the days ahead. We are going to be at this a long time. You are not going to fix a dysfunctional health care marketplace in a matter of weeks. We are going to be at this the rest of this week. next week. well into 2010. I have been part of this debate since I was codirector of the Oregon Gray Panthers. going back 30 years now. I continue to believe there is an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to work together. Our party has been right on the issue of coverage. You cannot fix this unless all Americans have good. quality. affordable coverage because otherwise there will be too much cost shifting. But as I have said to my colleagues on the other side of the aisleI see Senator BUNNING. and he and I have worked together on the Finance Committeeour colleagues on the other side of the aisle make important points with respect to choice. with respect to markets. with respect to competition. This is an area we can work on together. There is nothing partisan. in my view. about creating a new health care marketplace through these exchanges. This bill lays a foundation. and there will be opportunities for Democrats and Republicans to build on that foundation in the days ahead.

1110032153,I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 1679 will replace lost income for military reservists working for the House of Representatives when they are activated for more than 30 days. I introduced this bill after discussion with several House employees who also serve as members of armed services. When they are Called up. these men and women must leave their homes. families and jobs. often for an undetermined and unpredictable amount of time. While on active duty. men and women earn the wages of fulltime servicemen and forfeit their regular salary. Many leading companies have helped families survive during this troubling time by paying the difference between their usual salary and their activeduty pay. This bill would do the same thing for House employees. It requires the CAO to provide that supplement for House employees when they are activated involuntarily. This is a good bill that honors the devoted public service of House employees who not only serve as stewards of the democracy at home but as her defender abroad. I thank the ranking member. Mr. LUNGREN. Mr. MCCARTHY and now Mr. HARPER for working with us on this legislation. I urge all Members to support it.

1110068663,Mr. President. thank you very much. I rise tonight to continue the discussion and debate on health care. I had the chance over the last couple of months not only to do a good bit of work on a number of issues that relate to the bill and the two bills that came before and were merged into one bill. but also to hear from constituents across Pennsylvania. Some of them are writing to us and urging us to pass a bill and some are urging us to go in the other direction. But the communications I get from people who write about their own stories. their own family. their own challenges are. of course. the most compelling and the most worthy of time and attention. Often they come from Pennsylvania families who are not only facing health care challenges but facing economic challenges that I dont think anyone in this Chamber can fully understand. at least not at this point in someones life. Because when you become a Member of Congress. you are usually in pretty good shape. You may not have a lot of wealth. but you at least have a job to go to every day. you have a lot of people helping you. and you have health care. That is not something that can be said for tens of millions of Americans. This legislation is the culmination of a lot of debate and discussion and analysis and study over many decades now. It is nice that we have been talking for years and years about preventing a preexisting condition from barring someones coverage or treatment. It is nice to talk about it. but it is a lot better when we do something about it. It is nice we have talked about limiting outofpocket costs for families who are trying to take care of their children. trying to care of themselves. but it is a lot better to do it. to enact it into law. This bill makes it illegal to use preexisting conditions to deny someone coverage. This bill makes it illegal for insurance companies to put a lifetime cap on services. or an annual cap. This bill makes it illegal to discriminate so that no longer. if we do what we must do and get this bill passed. can an insurance company discriminate against a woman. which they do all the time now. just as they prevent people from getting coverage due to a preexisting condition. We have an opportunity to change the way we provide health care in ways we havent been able to imagine. let alone enact into law. One issue that has motivated me throughout this whole debate is what happens to our children at the end of the debate. at the end the legislative line. so to speak. Will children in Americaand I am speaking about poor children and those with special needs because they are the ones who need help. If you are in a wealthy family. you will figure it out. and your family will figure it out. If you happen to be a child of a poor family or a child who has special needs. will you be better off at the end of this debate or will you be worse off. As it relates to poor children and children with special needs. the goal here has to be no child worse off. It is very simple. It is a very simple test. That is what we have been working on. I believe this bill that is on the floor right now is a dramatic improvement in the lives of so many families. I still think we have some more work to do as it relates to children. but there is no question that the bill we are debating will make children a priority in ways we havent been able to do in any kind of other legislation. other than the childrens health insurance legislation that Congress enacted going back more than a decade ago and that we reauthorized this past year. I wish to speak about two families tonight. This isnt a discussion about theory or about the nuances of a policy. This is about real people and what has happened to them under our existing system. I wish to put up the first chart. This chart depicts one family. the Ritter family in Manheim. PA. I spoke with them several days ago and I spoke with these two young girls. One daughters name is Hannahone twin. I should say. is Hannah and her sisterafter I spoke on the floor I called their mom to talk about what I had said on the floor and I said to her. I think I referred to one of your daughters as Madeline. and that is incorrect. it is Madeline. So I want Madeline to know I correctly pronounced her name my second time around. Part of that is because of a story I read to my daughters when they were kids all the time. But there was a story about Madeline. and a lot of parents know that story. So I apologize to Stacie Ritter. But here is the story that Stacie Ritter has told me through this communication. but has told a lot of other people. and now we try to tell her story on the Senate floor to give meaning to what we are talking about here. But this isnt some public policy discussion about health care. this is about what happens to real families when we dont get the policy right. when we talk and talk year after year. decade after decade. and talk about good intentions. but never get it done. never get a bill passed. This is what happens to people. Stacie Ritter had to declare bank ruptcy after her twins were diagnosed with leukemia at the age of 4. My wife Teresa and I have four daughters. and thank goodness they are all healthy. Two of them are in college. one is in high school. and one is in seventh grade. We have never had to face that kind of diagnosis. thank goodness. Thank God I have never had to face that. nor has my wife Teresa had to face that as a parent. But if we did. we would have been given some protection and so would our daughters if we faced that horrific diagnosis. because when I was working as a lawyer or when I was a public official. I had health care. Sometimes. for a lot of that time period. a decade in State government health care. because I was a State employee. I had a tremendous health care plan. a kind of public option. a good public health care plan. So I never had to worry about that as a parent nor did my wife if something horrific were diagnosed. These two little girls pictured hereand you can see even though because of that diagnosis they are facing the kind of challenge I cant even imagine. let alone endureI hope I could. but I am not sure I could if I were in their place. But you can see that even though it is obvious they are facing a real challenge with regard to the leukemia. they are very hopeful. arent they. in that picture. They have their arms around each other. They have these stethoscopes and they are dressed up like two doctors. So even in the midst of the horror of that kind of a diagnosis. you have these two brave little girls who are looking forward. not just worried about their one situation but looking forward with hope and optimism. Here is a picture down here taken last year in Washington. DC. then at the age of 11. Here is what their mother said: Without meaningful health reform my girls will be unable to afford care. that is if they are even eligible for care. that is critically necessary to maintain this chronic condition. Punished and rejected because they had the misfortune of developing cancer as a child. What is the particular problem here with this case? The obvious problem is that these young girls were diagnosed with leukemia. That is bad enough. But we have a system that made their life a lot worse than the leukemia. because we had a system that saidbasically what the system said to them is: We can help you and maybe cure you. but we are going to put limits on it. We are going to say that it is nice to have all of this technology and all of this great medical knowledge and great doctors and hospitals across Americaand we do. We are the envy of the world on some of this stuff: the doctors and the nurses and the health care professionals. and the hospitals and the technology and the knowhow. We are the envy of the world. We should acknowledge that. But then we have this ridiculous system that says to these two little girls: But the care we want to give you and the results we can get from that care are going to be limited. So we hope it works out for you. That is ridiculous. It is an abomination. I dont understand why we have gone year after year and settled for this. Why do we have limits on the kind of care people get? Because insurance companies thought that was a good idea. I dont know why. I dont know whether it is for their bottom line or for whatever reason. but there is no excuseno rationalefor saying to someone: We can cure you. but we are going to limit your care. You are in real trouble. and we know how to help you. But we are going to limit it. Here is what Stacie said about her kids: When my identical twins were both diagnosed with [this leukemia] . . . at the age of four. we were told they would need a bone marrow transplant in order to survive. Thats when I learned that the insurance company thought my daughters were only worth $1 million each. I dont know a parent in America who believes their son or daughterin this case. two daughters. her twinsis worth any amount of money or their care is worth any amount of money. Why does the insurance company do it? We hear they say that is policy. and then they get pressure from a TV station or news organization and they give the care. If the policy makes sense. why would public pressure change a policy? The policy is ridiculous and insulting. It should be changed. It is one of those things we have to make illegal. and this bill does that. We should make it illegal for an insurance company to do that to children. But it doesnt make a lot of sense unless you talk about it in terms of a real story. Here is what Stacie Ritter said after she talked about the limitvery flatly. she said two words about whether a $i million is enough to care for two daughters with leukemia over many years: Its not! When you add up the costs involved in caring for a patient with a lifethreatening disease like cancer. $1 million barely covers it. We have lots of stories like this. Fortunately. the hospital social worker recommended we apply for secondary insurance through the State considering the highly probable chance we would hit the cap. And we did hit that cap before the end of treatment. The State program sounds a lot like a public option. I may be wrong. but it sounds an awful lot like that. Thankfully. the State program kicked in and helped pay for the remainder of treatment. So that part of the story worked itself out. It didnt work itself out because the insurance company said: We have a way to help you. and we are going to do it and figure out the cost in another way. No. the insurance company didnt help them. It was the State program in this casethe kind of public option that helped these kids. That part of the story has somewhat of a positive outcome. These kids are only 11. When they were 4 and 5. they didnt have that kind of an option. This story gets worse. This is what Stacie says: During this time. my husband had to take family medical leave so we could take turns caring for our oneyearold son and our twins at the hospital ... For the 7 months my husband was out on family medical leave. he was able to maintain his employerbased insurance for us via a $717.18 a month COBRA payment. Let me get this straight. We are now talking about COBRAthe extension of insurance coverage for people who are hurting. laid off or unemployed. That is another government initiative enacted by Congress. I am sure there were some folks who thought lets not use government to extend health insurance. But in this case. it was helpful to this family. But it wasnt enough. Here is what Stacie says. as she keeps going: After spending all our savings to pay the mortgage and other basic living expenses. we had to rely on credit cards. We have a health care system that forced Stacie Ritter. and lots of other families in America. to rely upon credit cards so they could get the health care for their daughters who have leukemia and make ends meet so they could pay the mortgage and all the other things they had to pay for for themselves and their daughters and their son. That is what this health care system has forced them to do. This isnt unambiguous. This is exactly the result of the worse part of our health care system. This last sentence might be the most poignant. She mentions they filed bankruptcy: And when you file bankruptcy. everything must be disclosed. We even had to hand over the kids savings accounts that their great grandparents had given them when they were born. That is another problem with this messed up system we have. It forced this family not only to worry about whether their daughters were going to be taken care of with leukemia. it not only said they probably had to declare bankruptcy to take care of themselves and get the care they needed. but in the course of the bankruptcy proceedings. they had to turn over savings accounts. I dont care if it was $1 or $1.000 or a much higher amount. I dont care what the amount was. We should never allow a system to force two little girls with leukemia to turn over their savings accounts that their great grandparents started for them. That is how bad the system is. I will spend lots of time complimenting doctors. hospitals. and nurses. We have a lot of good things. We have good technology. OK. I am acknowledging all that. But this system is messed up when we have this happen to one family. I dont care if it is one family or 1 million. but we know there are lots of them out there who face similar circumstances. Some people might say you are talking about the family and all these problems. What does your bill do? It so happens the first provision in the billgo by the table of contents and go to the pageI think page 16. The first provision of the bill talks about not having limits on lifetime coverage. If that were in effect when Stacie Ritter and her husband got the diagnosis for their daughtersif that was in effect. the following would have happened. and this is irrefutable: No. 1. they were upset. and as worried as they were about their daughters. at least they would have had the peace of mind to know they didnt have to worry about it costing too much to get them care. They would not have had to worry about this causing bankruptcy. So at least we would have given them some peace of mind and some security. Then on top of that. we would have given them the kind of care they needed. including the followup care. When some people say we need to debate a little longer. 3 months or 6 months more. or lets talk about it for a couple more yearswe have talked this issue to death for years. We know exactly what is wrong. This is what is wrong. That story alone is reason to pass the bill. There are a lot of other reasons. a lot of other tragedies that are preventable if we do the right thing. We have a bill that we are going to pass. and the first provision speaks to this familys challenge. Let me read one more letter and I will stop. I know I am over my time. We have heard a lot of discussion in the last couple of days about people whose personal tragedies bring all of us to our senses as we get lost in the politics. I received a letter this fall that I think sums it up in a way that both Hannahs and Madelines story does as well. This is a letter that I received from a woman in Havertown. PA. suburban Philadelphia. She says: On September 9. 2009. my sisterinlaws cousin had to take her threeweekold son off of life support. He took two shallow breaths and passed away peacefully. He did not have to die. he did not have to be on life support. he did not even have to be in the [neonatal intensive care unit] NICU. At 36 weeks gestation. his mother was told that she had Placentaprevia. but the insurance company and the doctor were at a tug of war on getting it covered. This is America. Why should a doctor have to be in any tug of war about whether this mother. who is pregnant. will be covered? That should not even be a discussion. There should not have to be any discussion about that. But that is how messed up our system is. At 39 weeks. Brandons umbilical cord ruptured. His mother Karen was rushed to the hospital and Brandon was taken to Jefferson [hospital] in Philadelphia to undergo brain cooling treatment to return brain activity. It was too late. After minimal return of brain activity. it was decided after 3 weeks to remove life support. She concludes with this haunting sentence. this haunting reminder of how bad a case this is: Who saved money here? Was it worth a childs life to save a few dollars? And I am sure 3 weeks of life support costs more than a Csection. That is the end of her letter. So anybody who says that we have to make a couple little changes on the margins. but we have a great system that is not in need of major reformI need only point to these two examples. That is all the information I need. Unfortunately. we have thousandshundreds of thousands of additional examplesliterally millions of people who are denied coverage because of a preexisting condition. Sometimes because a woman has been a victim of domestic violence. that has been used as a preexisting condition in terms of whether she gets health care. So we have a messed up system. When we allow these tragedies to happen day after day. year after year. and we have people in Washington saying: We just could not get it done. we have to debate a little longerwe have to get a bill passed. We are going to do that in the next couple of weeks. We will take whatever steps are necessary to get this legislation passed because we cannot say to this woman who wrote to me from Havertown. PA. nor can we say to these two girls and their parentswe cant walk up to Hannah and Madeline and other kids like them in the country and say we tried to get that lifetime limit matter done. but it got a little contentious. We have to get it done. and we will get it done because we are summoned by a lot of things. But I think we are summoned by our conscience to get this done and make sure we can do everything possibleno system is perfectto prevent these tragedies.

1110032045,Mr. President. I rise to join with my senior colleague from Maine in sponsoring the Commercial Truck Highway Safety Demonstration Program Act. an important bill that addresses a significant safety problem in our State. Under current law. trucks weighing 100.000 pounds are allowed to travel on the portion of Interstate 95 designated as the Maine Turnpike. which runs from Maines border with New Hampshire to Augusta. our capital city. At Augusta. the Turnpike designation ends. but 195 proceeds another 200 miles north to Houlton. At Augusta. however. heavy trucks must exit the modern fourlane. limitedaccess highway and are forced onto smaller. twolane secondary roads that pass through cities. towns. and villages. Trucks weighing up to 100.000 pounds are permitted on interstate highways in New Hampshire. Massachusetts. and New York as well as the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec. The weight limit disparity on various segments of Maines Interstate Highway System is a significant impediment to commerce. increases wearandtear on our secondary roads. and. most important. puts our people needlessly at risk. Senator SNOWE and I have introduced this legislation several times in recent years. We remain concerned about the safety of our citizens who are needlessly put at risk when heavy trucks are forced off the main interstate and onto secondary roads through our towns and communities. Unfortunately. Maine has experienced two tragic deaths in the past few years due to accidents involving heavy trucks in this situation. One of these tragic accidents took the life of Susan Abraham. a bright and talented 17yearold highschool student from Hampden. Maine. when her car was struck by a heavy trudk on Route 9. The truck driver could not see Susans small car turning onto that twolane road as he rounded a corner. It was an accident. but one that would have been avoided had the .truck remained -on the Interstate highway. Interstate 95 runs less than threequarters of a mile away. but Federal law prevented the truck from using that modern. divided highway. a highway that was designed to provide ample views of the road ahead. That preventable tragedy took place almost one year to the day after Lena Gray. an 80yearold resident of Bangor. was struck and killed by a tractortrailer as she was crossing a downtown street. Again. that accident would not have occurred had that truck been allowed to use 195. which runs directly through Bangor. The problem Maine faces due to the disparity in truck weight limits affects many communities. but it is clearly evident in the eastern Maine cities of Bangor and Brewer. In this region. a twomile stretch of Interstate 395 connects two major State highways that carry significant truck traffic across Maine. 1395 affords direct and safe access between these major corridors. but because of the existing Federal truck weight limit. many heavy trucks are prohibited from using this multilane. limited access highway. Instead. these trucks. which sometimes carry hazardous materials. are required to maneuver through the downtown portions of Bangor and Brewer on twolane roadways. Truckers are faced with two options. the first is a 3.5 mile diversion through downtown Bangor that requires several very difficult and dangerous turns. The seco nd route is a 7.5 mile diversion that includes 20 traffic lights and requires travel through portions of downtown Bangor as well. Congestion is a significant issue. and safety is seriously compromised as a result of these required diversions. In June 2004. Wilbur Smiths Associates. a nationally recognized transportation consulting firm. completed a study to examine the impact a Federal weight exemption on nonexempt portions of Maines Interstate Highway System would have on safety. pavement. and bridges. The study found that extending the current truck weight exemption on the Maine Turnpike to all interstate highways in Maine would result in a decrease of 3.2 fatal crashes per year. A uniform truck weight limit of 100.000 pounds on Maines interstate highways would reduce highway miles. as well as the travel times necessary to transport freight through Maine. resulting in safety. economic. and environmental benefits. Moreover. Maines extensive network of local roads would be better preserved without the wear and tear of heavy truck traffic. Most important. however. a uniform truck weight limit will keep truicks on the interstate where they belong. rather than on roads and highways that pass through Maines cities. towns. and neighborhoods. In addition to the safety of motorists and pedestrians. there is a homeland security aspect to this as well. An accident or attack involving a heavy truck carrying explosive fuel or a hazardous chemical on a congested city street would have devastating consequences. That risk can be alleviated substantially by allowing those trucks to stay on the open highway. The legislation that Senator SNOWE and I are introducing addresses the safety issues we face in Maine because of the disparities in truck weight limits: The legislation directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish a commercial truck safety pilot program in Maine. Under the pilot program. the truck weight limit on all Maine highways that are part of the Interstate Highway System would be set at 100.000 pounds for three years. During the waiver period. the Secretary would study the impact of the pilot program on safety and would receive the input of a panel on which State officials. and representatives from safety organizations. municipalities. and the commercial trucking industry would serve. The waiver would become permanent if the panel determined that motorists were safer as a result of a uniform truck weight limit on Maines Interstate Highway System. Maines citizens and motorists are needlessly at risk because too many heavy trucks are forced off the interstate and onto local roads. the legislation Senator SNOWE and I are introducing is a commonsense approach to a significant safety problem in my State. Our efforts are widely supported by public officials throughout Maine. including the Governor. the Maine Department of Transportation. the Maine Secretary of State. and the Maine State Police. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.,111118301,COLLINS,SUSAN,S,ME,F,R,,voting,2009-04-22,280,Ms. COLLINS,12556,12747,04222009.txt,6309,1000,111,2009,mr presid rise join senior colleagu main sponsor commerci truck highway safeti demonstr program act import bill address signific safeti problem state current law truck weigh pound allow travel portion interst design main turnpik run main border new hampshir augusta capit citi augusta turnpik design end proce anoth mile north houlton augusta howev heavi truck must exit modern fourlan highway forc onto smaller twolan secondari road pass citi town villag truck weigh pound permit interst highway new hampshir massachusett new york well canadian provinc new brunswick quebec weight limit dispar variou segment main interst highway system signific impedi commerc increas secondari road import put peopl needlessli risk senat snow introduc legisl sever time recent year remain concern safeti citizen needlessli put risk heavi truck forc main interst onto secondari road town commun unfortun main experienc two tragic death past year due accid involv heavi truck situat one tragic accid took life susan abraham bright talent yearold highschool student hampden main car struck heavi rout truck driver could see susan small car turn onto twolan road round corner accid one would avoid truck remain interst highway interst run less threequart mile away feder law prevent truck use modern divid highway highway design provid ampl view road ahead prevent tragedi took place almost one year day lena gray yearold resid bangor struck kill tractortrail cross downtown street accid would occur truck allow use run directli bangor problem main face due dispar truck weight limit affect mani commun clearli evid eastern main citi bangor brewer region twomil stretch interst connect two major state highway carri signific truck traffic across main afford direct safe access major corridor exist feder truck weight limit mani heavi truck prohibit use limit access highway instead truck sometim carri hazard materi requir maneuv downtown portion bangor brewer twolan roadway trucker face two option first mile divers downtown bangor requir sever difficult danger turn nd rout mile divers includ traffic light requir travel portion downtown bangor well congest signific issu safeti serious compromis result requir divers june wilbur smith associ nation recogn transport consult firm complet studi examin impact feder weight exempt nonexempt portion main interst highway system would safeti pavement bridg studi found extend current truck weight exempt main turnpik interst highway main would result decreas fatal crash per year uniform truck weight limit pound main interst highway would reduc highway mile well travel time necessari transport freight main result safeti econom environment benefit moreov main extens network local road would better preserv without wear tear heavi truck traffic import howev uniform truck weight limit keep interst belong rather road highway pass main citi town neighborhood addit safeti motorist pedestrian homeland secur aspect well accid attack involv heavi truck carri explos fuel hazard chemic congest citi street would devast consequ risk allevi substanti allow truck stay open highway legisl senat snow introduc address safeti issu face main dispar truck weight limit legisl direct secretari transport establish commerci truck safeti pilot program main pilot program truck weight limit main highway part interst highway system would set pound three year waiver period secretari would studi impact pilot program safeti would receiv input panel state offici repres safeti organ municip commerci truck industri would serv waiver would becom perman panel determin motorist safer result uniform truck weight limit main interst highway system main citizen motorist needlessli risk mani heavi truck forc interst onto local road legisl senat snow introduc commonsens approach signific safeti problem state effort wide support public offici throughout main includ governor main depart transport main secretari state main state polic urg colleagu support import legisl,602,FALSE
1110011877,Madam Speaker. let me thank my colleague from California for yielding. Today. earlier. President Obama held a town hall meeting in Fort Meyer. Florida. He discussed the need to create more jobs for Florida families and families across our country. This has been one of our shared goals since the outset of this process. And thats why House Republicans have crafted a plan that creates the most jobs in the shortest. period of time. In fact. our plan would create 141.000 more jobs for Florida families than the package thats under consideration. And overall. it would create twice as many jobs. some 6.2 million jobs in all. at half of the price of the bill thats moving through Congress. And dont just take my word for it. This is based on the methodology used by President Obamas own nominee as chair of. the White House Council of Economic Advisers. Dr. Christina Romer. How? How do we create all of these jobs? We encourage investment and create jobs by letting families. small businesses. home buyers and job seekers keep more of what they earn. Unfortunately. the House and Senate bills take us in a different direction. We already know that they rely on slowmoving. wasteful spending here in Washington. but theres more. .The plan thats currently on the table tries to take advantage of the crisis in our economy to enact a series of liberal policy proposals that have nothing to do with economic recovery. It discourages Americans from working. loosens welfare reforms work requirements. and encourages more Americans to become dependent on government programs. And through a proposal called Comparative Effectiveness. it aims to put the Federal Government in charge of some of the most important life and death decisions that families face. The bill is supposed to be about creating jobs. not about reversing welfare reform or letting government ration out Americas health care options. There is still time for both parties to work together to craft a bill that puts job creation first and foremost. But I think its up to the majority to help make that happen. ] 1445 Republicans want to work in a constructive way to help families during this economic crisis. and we want to answer the Presidents call for bipartisanship and his call for a plan that creates jobs first and foremost. The bills being considered dont do that. We do believe that our economy is in a crisis. Families and small businesses [SE H1093 are hurting. and the government must act. but we must act in a prudent way that does what we all want to do. and thats to preserve jobs in America and to create more jobs in America. Unfortunately. the plans that were seeing dont do that. The plan that we put on the table for consideration would. in fact. create 6.2 million jobs over the next 2 years. twice as many jobs as the bills being considered at half the price tag. Its time to work in a bipartisan way to solve this crisis. and I would urge my colleagues to listen to our ideas and work with us on behalf of the American people.,111118060,BOEHNER,JOHN,H,OH,M,R,8,voting,2009-02-10,202,Mr. BOEHNER,15857,15945,02102009.txt,3010,527,111,2009,madam speaker let thank colleagu california yield today earlier presid obama held town hall meet fort meyer florida discuss need creat job florida famili famili across countri one share goal sinc outset process that hous republican craft plan creat job shortest period time fact plan would creat job florida famili packag that consider overal would creat twice mani job million job half price bill that move congress dont take word base methodolog use presid obama nomine chair white hous council econom advis dr christina romer creat job encourag invest creat job let famili small busi home buyer job seeker keep earn unfortun hous senat bill take us differ direct alreadi know reli slowmov wast spend washington there plan that current tabl tri take advantag crisi economi enact seri liber polici propos noth econom recoveri discourag american work loosen welfar reform work requir encourag american becom depend govern program propos call compar effect aim put feder govern charg import life death decis famili face bill suppos creat job revers welfar reform let govern ration america health care option still time parti work togeth craft bill put job creation first foremost think major help make happen republican want work construct way help famili econom crisi want answer presid call bipartisanship call plan creat job first foremost bill consid dont believ economi crisi famili small busi se hurt govern must act must act prudent way want that preserv job america creat job america unfortun plan see dont plan put tabl consider would fact creat million job next year twice mani job bill consid half price tag time work bipartisan way solv crisi would urg colleagu listen idea work us behalf american peopl,280,FALSE

1110003881,I wanted to share a few thoughts. Many years ago. I was a student at Indiana Purdue University in Fort Wayne. Im old now. But in the late 1960s and 1970s. prior to Roe v. Wade. many of us were concerned about the liberalization of abortion laws inCalifornia and New York. And I was then a graduate student at the University of Notre Dame on January 22. 1973 when the Supreme Court decision on abortion came through. Therese Willke. the daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Willke from Cincinnati. who founded the National Right To Life and came up with the little feet. and I formed an organization called Student Coalition for the Human Life Amendment with Dr. Charles Rice who wrote the original human life amendment who was a law professor at Notre Dame and was our faculty adviser. We worked for many years trying to overturn the decision. But it has been interesting to watch both my pattern at the personal level and to watch the prolife movement evolve. When I was a young male student. quite frankly. I didnt know much about babies. didnt really care a whole lot about babies. thought that maybe when they became college age I would be able to relate well. so I cant say I was initially motivated by love. I was motivated by horror. Who would take the life of these innocent babies? Probably my first eyeopening experience was in the Lamaze baby course as I was watching my own daughter. Brooke. develop in the womb. feeling the attachment of a parent. and then all of a sudden the love side comes in. The prolife movement started mostly as a frustration to overturn a law. But as the prolife movement evolved. we still have many people trying to be a symbol to the Nation. a conscience in the march here tomorrow and marches all over the country. like in Fort Wayne on Saturday. But my wife now works at the Hope Center. We support womens care centers. Tonight she is on a hotline trying to deal with young mothers. Because for too long. all we were concerned about was stopping abortion and not helping the mothers involved. What do they do? All of a sudden. theyre in a disastrous situation. They dont know how they are going to deal with school.

1110055681,the former chairman. and JOE BARTON. the thenchairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. were able to vote for a bill because. in fact. it was bipartisan. Yesterday more -than 200 amendments were filed up at the Rules Committee. .many of them Republican. many of them. bipartisan. Mr. HILL. Democrat from Indiana. andI offered a bipartisan amendment on nuclear. Nuclear is one issue that is absent from this bill. Dont ask me why. There are no greenhouse gas emissions from nuclear. It really is a jobs bill. Ive got two nuclear plants in my congressional district.. When they were both brought online. 85 percent of the components were made in America. Today for a new nuclear plant. 85 percent is going to come from someplace else because we turned the light from green to red on nuclear the last 20. 25 years. Yet no amendment on nuclear in this bill and in this rule. I woke up this morning and saw my friend and colleague Mr. INSLEE speaking on CSPAN. He said this bill was going .to cost only a postage stamp. I looked at the paper this morning and saw a fullpage ad: gasoline costs will only. go up 2 cents a gallon. You know. I hope theyre true. But I dont think that those statements are going to be true. We had amendments as a safety valve in case it does go up. The CBO and Airjerican Petroleum Institute say that gas prices are going to go up 77 cents a gallon. diesel prices 88 cents a gallon. Some energy costs could go up by 40 to 50 percent. We had -amendments that said. hey. if gasoline goes up to 5 bucks a gallon. were going to take off this capandtrade. If electricity prices go up more than 10 percent. well take off capandtrade. If unemployment reaches 15 percent. and its almost there already in Michigan. well take off those jobkillifig provisions. Were - those amendments allowed? No. Then weve got the whole issue of India and China. jobs going. someplace else. That consumed a couple of hours of debate. I think in full committee. Yet no amendment at all allowed on the House floor. Madam Speaker. my folks want to work and pay taxes. Yet theyre going to find- themselves laid off. and in Michigan a hundred thousand folks this year will run out of benefits. No amendments are allowed to help those folks.

1110075209,Madam President. I would like to add to what Senator BAUCUS said by speaking positively on this issue and to remind my colleagues who maybe have been watching in the last 3 weeks and have seen Senator BAUCUS and I on opposite sides of the issue of health care reformit is uncharacteristic for us to have different points of view on legislation. In the 10 years he and I have been leaders of the Finance Committee. most of the issues coming out of our committee have been very bipartisan. What he just talked about and what I am going to respond to is one of those issues. I agree with Chairman BAUCUS that we should retroactively extend the expiring tax provisions as soon as possible after Congress reconvenes in 2010. As chairman of the Finance Committee in 2005. I worked with thenRanking Member BAUCUS. and we authored the biodiesel tax credit. The biodiesel tax credit is a tax credit that is needed to be extended before the end of the year to prevent the U.S. biodiesel market from grinding to a halt on January 1. 2010. This tax credit differs from other tax provisions in that the price of biodiesel will be $1 higher on January 1. 2010. as a result of the tax credit not being extended before that date. That means people will simply buy petroleum diesel rather than biodiesel come January 1. 2010. I point out that support in Congress for extending the biodiesel tax credit. I think. has been and still is robust. bipartisan. and bicameral. and that it has not been extended prior to January 1. 2010. due solely to issues unrelated to the merits of the biodiesel tax credit. I want everybody to know that I agree with Chairman BAUCUS that the expiration of these tax provisions creates uncertainty and complexity in the tax law. I also agree that the taxpayers need notice that these tax provisions will be in place so they can plan their personal and business affairs to fully and efficiently use the intended tax incentives. In addition. extending the tax provisions as early as possible in 2010. as we intend to do. will minimize the administrative problems created for the Internal Revenue Service. I look forward to working with Chairman BAUCUS to retroactively extend these provisions as soon as possible when the Senate reconvenes in,111119591,GRASSLEY,CHARLES,S,IA,M,R,,voting,2009-12-22,147,Mr. GRASSLEY,7973,8037,12222009.txt,2251,395,111,2009,madam presid would like add senat baucu said speak posit issu remind colleagu mayb watch last week seen senat baucu opposit side issu health care reformit uncharacterist us differ point view legisl year leader financ committe issu come committe bipartisan talk go respond one issu agre chairman baucu retroact extend expir tax provis soon possibl congress reconven chairman financ committe work thenrank member baucu author biodiesel tax credit biodiesel tax credit tax credit need extend end year prevent us biodiesel market grind halt januari tax credit differ tax provis price biodiesel higher januari result tax credit extend date mean peopl simpli buy petroleum diesel rather biodiesel come januari point support congress extend biodiesel tax credit think still robust bipartisan bicamer extend prior januari due sole issu unrel merit biodiesel tax credit want everybodi know agre chairman baucu expir tax provis creat uncertainti complex tax law also agre taxpay need notic tax provis place plan person busi affair fulli effici use intend tax incent addit extend tax provis earli possibl intend minim administr problem creat intern revenu servic look forward work chairman baucu retroact extend provis soon possibl senat reconven,189,FALSE
1110021182,Mr. President. I wish today to speak in support of S. 408. legislatfon that I introduced along with my colleague. Senator INOUYE. to reauthorize the Emergency Medical Services for Children. EMSC. Program administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. HHS. Health Resources and Services Administrations. HRSA. Maternal and Child Health Bureau. MCHB. It is fitting that we do this in the year of the programs 25th anniversary. The purpose of the EMSC Program is straightforward: to ensure stateoftheart emergency medical care for ill or injured children and adolescents. Children have different medical needs than adults. and that presents special challenges for emergency and trauma care providers. These differences - do not solely relate to medical supplies. They are also physiological and emotional. Not only will an adultsized facemask not adequately administer oxygen to a child. but. for example. childrens respiratory systems function differently. so they are more at risk for inflammation and infection. and they maintain fluid balances differently and thus are more prone to dehydration and death due to blood and fluid loss. Kids even may not be old enough or sufficiently cognizant to communicate what exactly is wrong with them or how they got hurt.,111118171,HATCH,ORRIN,S,UT,M,R,,voting,2009-03-16,104,Mr. HATCH,3314,3349,03162009.txt,1275,199,111,2009,mr presid wish today speak support introduc along colleagu senat inouy reauthor emerg medic servic children emsc program administ depart health human servic hh health resourc servic administr hrsa matern child health bureau fit year program th anniversari purpos emsc program straightforward ensur stateoftheart emerg medic care ill injur children adolesc children differ medic need adult present special challeng emerg trauma care provid differ sole relat medic suppli also physiolog emot adequ administ oxygen child exampl children respiratori system function differ risk inflamm infect maintain fluid balanc differ thu prone dehydr death due blood fluid loss kid even may old enough suffici cogniz commun exactli wrong got hurt,112,FALSE
1110062480,I thank the gentleman for recognizing me and want to acknowledge before we start. PATRICK. I know youre going to speak later. but I hope that this is somewhat fulfilling for you. It can never replace the loss of your dad. but hopefully it will at least let you know how much the people that served with him had the honor and pleasure of doing that. loved doing it and appreciated him every day. And my colleague. BILL DELAHUNT. was more than just the Congressman for the Senator. so I extend my sympathies to you as well. you were a friend. probably even closer than most of us were because you were there so often and spent so much time with him. And so I express those condolences to you. But its a loss to all of us. The Dean of the delegation. ED MARKEY. of course. served many. many years with the Senator. I looked at a little factoid the other day that indicated that Senator Kennedy was born on the 200th anniversary of George Washingtons birthday. I thought if thats accurate. and I assume that it is. how interesting it was. because nobody appreciated history more than Senator Kennedy and nobody appreciated his role in history more than that. I can remember ED MARKEY at one point. at a function introducing Senator Kennedy as one of the best United States Senators. only to be corrected by the Senator saying. One of the best? The best. And while he was joking. I think he turned out to be absolutely right on that because he certainly has a record that you have heard from JOHN OLVER and others here that is just phenomenal. JIMMY McGOVERN expressed it as well. I wont start to enumerate all of the things that the Senator did. Wed be here for far too long. And I think. after hearing my colleagues. most people finally start to appreciate that wherever you were in life. you benefited from him. whether you were cleaning hotel rooms or doing some other job that was difficult like that. you benefited from the minimum wage. health care. education. all the things that we care about. And frankly. when we are all looking to try and have the honor of serving here. listening to people in our constituencies. theyre talking about those things that matter to them. the bread and butter issues. whether or not theyre going to have a job. whether or not it pays well. whether or not theyre going to be able to keep their family healthy. whether or not theyre going to be able to give their children opportunity. This great Senator epitomized all of that. One thing that I dont think has been mentioned so far that I just want to hit on is the fact that the Senator used to tell a story about being lectured by his father when he turned 21 or so about the fact that he was going to be the recipient of some resources that other people didnt have the benefit of. he could choose to be idle and do nothing with his time. or he could choose to be of service to others and to mankind. We all know which route he took. But that remains an inspiring story to all people even to today. And during the course of this summer when the President had his Service to America campaign going on. many of us had the opportunity to go and visit a lot of organizations that had volunteers in. and when you would remind them of that story and tell them about the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act that was signed into law earlier in the year by President Obama and now their role in stepping into his belief of service and doing something for their fellow citizens. doing something for America and no matter how small or large. no matter where it was. you could see the inspiration that they got from the Senator. from his life. from his acts. and from the fact that this law had passed because he motivated people to pass it and get it through. This will remain as one of his great legacies. the fact that he spent his life serving others. that he was selfless in that regard. and that while he was serious about the business that he did. he was also never taking himself too seriously. and always willing to make people feel comfortable and to see the lighter side of things and to see the better part of humanity. In even people who were his political opponents. he saw a good part. and he was able to draw out of them a response that made them accept him and others and work on issues together. I can remember being with the Senator when we would go out. particularly to senior citizen places where he just couldnt resist singing a song. particularly Irish song. couldnt resist getting out and dancing if there was a ballroom dance going on. And. of course. I guess I must take myself too seriously. or just know how bad a singer or bad a dancer I am. I was always looking for the door. and he would never let that happen. Hed be the first one to force you on the floor. make a fool of yourself. but have some fun and go on that. Thats the humanity of the man. that he loved everybody. he loved having a good time with them. could get them to go along with him. and then when it was time to get serious. he could do that in a heartbeat. He could make the case. He had great oratorical skills that carried the day over and over again. And he truly is a giant. I know that the story of his life is just jumping off the shelves right now because people are starting to remember all that he did. Sometimes in the hustle and bustle of political jargon. people making attacks and going back and forth. people forget that when you separate all that out. whether you are a conservative. or whether you are a liberal. whatever your political opinion. there are things in your life that you have that youre grateful for that are a result of the work of Senator Kennedy. I think thats the bottom line in all of this is that this Senator was a great Senator for America. He was a great friend to all of us. He was a great father and brother for people in Massachusetts.

1110034527,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. House Res. 109 supports the goals and mission of National Crime Victims Rights week. which is being celebrated this week. April 26 through May 2. 2009. The 2009 National Crime Victims Rights week theme is ""25 Years of Rebuilding Lives: Celebrating the Victims of Crime Act."" Mr. Speaker. each year for the last 25 years. the Office of Victims of Crime in the Department of Justice has observed National Crime Victims Rights week along with individuals and communities across the country. Victims rights and crime victims are honored with rallies. candlelight vigils. and other commemorative events. This week in April is an important time to increase public awareness about the needs and concerns of the 25 million victims and survivors of crime each year. of which over 6 million are victims of violent crimes. During National Crime Victims Rights week. people are asked to take time out to acknowledge the impact that crime has on families. individuals. and communities by ensuring that resources and services are available to help crime victims rebuild their lives. We would also like to acknowledge the 25 years of contributions that the Office of Victims of Crime has made to supporting victims of both violent and nonviolent crime. A major aspect of the offices work has been the creation and supervision of the Crime Victims Fund. This fund is paid for by criminal fines and penalties and supplemented with general tax revenue as needed. Over the last 25 years. the Crime Victims Fund has collected more than $9 billion from offender fines and penalties. which is used solely to assist crime victims. Each year these funds support direct services and financial compensation to more than 4 million victims of crime. This week is also a time to make a commitment to providing more resources and services to crime victims who live in underserved areas such as urban and rural areas. This is also time to pay special attention to victims of crime who suffer from physical and mental disabilities in addition to child and senior citizens who may be victims of crime. Mr. Speaker. we should be doing more to invest in crime prevention and therefore reducing the number of victims. but meanwhile this resolution gives us the opportunity to celebrate victims rights and their dignity. We should ensure that victims are treated with the dignity and respect that they. deserve. and doing that will promote a fair and just criminal justice system. For these reasons. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution. Mr. Speaker.

Barack Obama. likes to state it. that the things that we need to do have just been putting in place fundamentals. sort of the railing on which our economy will roll out from in the next 18 months to the next 4 years. There is a lot of work to be done. a lot of human resource development to take place. a lot of training. and a lot of stimulating of our economy. And I want to take my hat off to all of my colleagues who voted in favor today of supporting the Reinvestment Act that we passed today. the economic stimulus and Reinvestment Act. And I look forward to getting back to my district and working with the folks in the community to be able to make sure that they access and hold accountable this Congress for making sure that this measure works for them. We all have to be engaged in this for it to work. If anyone is sitting back thinking that someone is going to come and hand something to them. I think that they missed the whole point of why we voted for change. The change is that we are going to stay engaged. that .we are going to ask for accountability in government. that we are going to demand it. and that we are going to see it come to fruition in the same way that we saw a new President become elected and installed.,111118930,CLARKE,YVETTE,H,NY,F,D,11,voting,2009-01-28,999,Ms. CLARKE,58319,58362,01282009.txt,1544,298,111,2009,thank much want close thank congressman ellison organ special order member progress caucu even think pretti much driven home advent pass hr remak america presid barack obama like state thing need put place fundament sort rail economi roll next month next year lot work done lot human resourc develop take place lot train lot stimul economi want take hat colleagu vote favor today support reinvest act pass today econom stimulu reinvest act look forward get back district work folk commun abl make sure access hold account congress make sure measur work engag work anyon sit back think someon go come hand someth think miss whole point vote chang chang go stay engag go ask account govern go demand go see come fruition way saw new presid becom elect instal,129,FALSE
1110013997,"Mr. President. as we come to the final vote on the stimulus package. I express my great regret that I am going to be unable to vote for it because we clearly need a stimulus package that works. The economy is in serious trouble. and we need to do the very best we can to restore confidence in our economy and in our future. Indeed. confidence. is the basic issue. Confidence is what it is all about. We have had glimpses that have led us to believe some sense of confidence could be restored. Unfortunately. in my view. we have squandered the opportunity. Let me put it in context. Lets go back to the time when President Obama was newly inaugurated and people were looking forward to the stimulus package and the activity with respect to banks and what would happen in the financial industry. If I can quote from an editorial that appeared in the Wall Street Journal over the weekend of February 7 and 8. they were talking about the gamble that the stimulus package represents. This is what they had to say: The biggest gamble with this stimulus is what it means if the economy doesnt recover. Monetary policy is already as stimulative as it can safely get. and the Obama administration is set to announce its big financial fix on Monday. That Monday wasthe Monday of this week. Mr. President. It goes on to say: Stocks rallied Friday on expectations of the latter. despite the job loss report. with big bank stocks leading the way. If done right. this will help reduce risk aversion and gradually restore financial confidence. Again. confidence is what we need to get the economy going in the right direction. Continuing to quote: We hope it does. because the size and waste of the stimulus means we wont have much ammunition left. The spending will take the U.S. budget deficit up to some 12 percent of GDP. about double the peak of the 1980s and into uncharted territory. The tragedy of the Obama stimulus is that we are getting so little for all that money. What did they mean when they talked about getting so little? Picking out a few examples. again quoting from the Wall Street Journal on the same day and an editorial on that issue. they point out: The Milwaukee public school system. for example. would receive $88.6 million over two years for new construction projects under the House version of the stimuluseven though the district currently has 15 vacant school buildings and declining enrollment. Between 1990 and 2008. inflationadjusted MPS spending rose by 35 percent. perpupil spending increased by 36 percent and state aid grew by 58 percent. Over the same period. enrollment fell by a percentage point and is projected to continue falling. leaving the system with enough excess capacity for 22.000 students. Yet they are going to receive $88.6 million to build new capacity. Do the schools they represent have difficult conditions? Back to the editorial and quoting: In general. MPS facilities have been described by school officials as being in good to betterthangood conditionReports the Milwaukee Journal Sentinelthe kind of situations that create urgent needs for renovation or new construction in some cities have not been on the priority list for MPS officials in recent years. So we are going to spend money to build Milwaukee schools and they dont have students to fill them. That is the kind of thing the Wall Street Journal was talking about. Lets look at what happened this week. Now. I go not to an American publication but to the Economist. printed in Great Britain. which has perhaps a more objective view than a publication focused on American politics: There was a chance that this week would mark a turning point in an everdeepening global slump. as Barack Obama produced the two main parts of his rescue plan. The first. and most arguedover. was a big fiscal boost. They are referring to the stimulus package. The. second. and more important. part of the rescue was team Obamas scheme for fixing the financial mess ... They refer there to the unveiling of the program that Secretary Geithner gave us on Tuesday of this week. They go on to describe the situation: America cannot rescue the world economy alone. But this double offensive by its biggest economy could potentially have broken the spiral of uncertainty and gloom that is gripping investors. producers and consumers across the globe. Again. Mr. President. they are pointing out that we have a significant crisis of confidence. They.say it applies to investors. producers. and consumers. Then they gave their judgment: Alas. that opportunity was squandered. Mr. Obama ceded control of the stimulus to the fractious congressional Democrats. allowing a plan that should have had broad support from both parties to become a divisive partisan battle. More serious still was Mr. Geithners financialrescue blueprint which. though touted as a bold departure from the incrementalism and uncertainty that plagued the Bush administrations Wall Street fixes. in fact looked depressingly like his predecessors efforts: timid. incomplete and short on detail. Despite talk of trilliondollar sums. stock markets tumbled. Far from boosting confidence. Mr. Obama seems at sea. These are comments not of an American publication. or of a Republican or Democratic partisan. but the comments of an objective observer from overseas. They go on: The fiscal stimulus plan has some obvious flaws. Too much of the boost to demand is backloaded to 2010 and beyond. The compromise bill is larded with spending determined more by Democrat lawmakers pet projects than by the efficiency with which the economy will be boosted. I will give you an example that fits that category. Quoting from the Wall Street Journal of today: An obscure Commerce Department office with a $19 million budget and fewer than 20 grant officers would end up in charge of $7 billion in grants to expand Internet access in rural areas. Mr. President. you have had executive responsibility at the State level. I have had executive responsibility in the private sector. Think for a moment about the workings of this situation. There is an office with 20 employees administering a $19 million budget that is going to receive. under this stimulus package. a check for $7 billion and then being told: Spend it wisely in expanding Internet access in rural areas. Mr. President. $7 billion does not get spent by 20 people overwhelmed by the task. It does not get spent expanding internet access in rural areas without careful studies and an intelligent plan laid out. That is an example of what ""The Economist"" is talking about when they say. and I go back to their quote: The bill is larded with spending determined more by Democrat lawmakers pet projects than by the efficiency with which the economy will be boosted. They go on to talk about more details of the stimulus plan. as well as the Geithner plan. but they summarize it this way under the heading. ""A great failure *of nerve."" They say: How serious is this setback? One interpretation is that Mr. Obamas crew mismanaged expectationsthat they promised a plan and came up with a concept. If so. that is a big mistake. Managing expectations is part of building confidence and when so much about these rescues is superhumanly complex. it is unforgivable to bungle the easy bit. More worrying still is the chance that Mr. Geithners vagueness comes from doubt about what to do. a reluctance to take tough decisions. and a timidity about asking Congress for enough cash. That is an alarming prospect. I wish I could support this stimulus -package. I am more than happy to reach out to the administration and do whatever I can to help solve this problem because our country is in serious difficulty and the world. as a whole.-is in even more. I regret. in the words of ""The Economist."" that this is an opportunity that .has been squandered. I hope in the coming weeks we can do something to regain the opportunity and regain the momentum we need in order to get to where we need to be.

1110073130,Let me thank the distinguished gentlelady from Maine. Madam Speaker. I wish to start by wishing America a very Merry Christmas. and to many other Americans. a happy holiday. And Id like to give my thanks to the Rules Committee and the staff of the Rules Committee for doing an enormous job. Our chairwoman. LOUISE SLAUGHTER. has been at the forefront of the major successes we have had on behalf of the American people. I offer my appreciation as well for Chairman JOHN MURTHA. who. in his astuteness and commitment to the men and women of the United States military. finds many of us today supporting the Defense appropriations bill. even as we begin to consider the next steps in Afghanistan. But why am I standing here today to be able to speak to my colleagues and the American people? One. because history gets distorted. We are in this predicament because the last administration of Republican leadership took away our surplus that had been created in the 1990s. They dashed and dashed and destroyed and devastated. Isnt it interesting that youd come now to complain about a leadership. President and Democratic leadership in Congress. that have had to make the political sacrifice to ensure that Americans can work? And so let me just set the record straight. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Actthat secured no Republican votescreated 3.5 million jobs and gave 95 percent of American workers a tax cut. And today. as we speak. we are cutting the job loss every single month. Why Im standing here today is because Im enthusiastically supporting this rule. because we will then pass a jobs bill. and I will be able to go home to those in the 18th Congressional District who told me over the Thanksgiving holiday as I was participating in feeding those on Thanksgiving Day. I lost my job from a major corporation. Well. Im going to tell them that because of infrastructure funding. $48 billion. in fact. that we will be able to invest in highways and mass transit. One billion dollars in Federal investments to highways creates 27.800 jobs. Is there something wrong with that? The wrongness of it is that the other side is not thinking about the American people. and has not had a good thought about how to invest in America. This jobs bill is going to keep States from cutting teachers and police and firefighters. and its going to provide job training. I am proud that they have taken my ideas and many of our ideas. but work that I have done on summer youth jobs. Theyre going to put 150.000 people in job training positions. One of the ideas that can be incorporated that I have put forward in a bill is to make sure that people can keep their unemployment while they are in a job training and receive a stipend.

1110024811,"I came to the floor to talk about the budget debate. I think it is very important that we let the American people know where we are on the budget and what this debate is really all about. We have a new President and we have a new budget. thank goodness. We have a budget that reflects the hopes and dreams of the American people. We have a budget that is going to cut the deficit in half by the time this Presidents term is over. We have a budget that is absolutely open in terms of the way it spends our money and the way it saves our money. It is important that we take a look at the type of economy this young President inherited: Record deficits. Record deficits that President George W. Bushs own party supported. It is very important that we remember that when George W. Bush got the key to the Oval Office. we had surpluses. Then we saw a 50percent increase in spending. We raw a debt that was about to be put away go up in major proportions. We are seeing the playing out of the worst recession since the Great Depressionia financial market in crisis. and a housing market in crisis because of the deregulation that was the centerpiece of George W. Bushs and the Republicans leadership. We are paying the price of those years today. We have a young President who came into office and said: Be patient. we are going to change the way we do business in this country. And we are going to do that. We started with the stimulus bill that got not one Republican vote on the House side. although some of my Republican friends over there are running around my State taking credit for the bill they voted against. We had three Republicans over here. whom I praise mightily for having the courage to do the right thing and get this economy back on track. .We have seen the loss of 3.3 million jobs in the last 6 months. The President is dealing with two ongoing wars that. by the way. were never paid for in the budget. They were taken off the budget. He now puts them in the budget so that the American people can see the truth. President Bush put them in emergency spending even though we knew he needed to fund them. What we have in the Presidents budget is a refreshing change of reality. honesty. integrity. and investments that have to be made. What are we getting from our Republican friends? We are getting just what we got when the Clinton budget passed without one Republican vote. I want to take us back to that because I think it is very interesting. intriguing. and enlightening to see what our Republican friends said about the last Democratic Presidents budget. You would have thought the sky was falling. You would have thought the universe would never survive. I have some of the quotes they made about the Clinton budgets. If people will remember. Al Gore. as Vice President. had to come over here and cast the ti6breaking vote on that budget. Here is what happened as a result of that budget. we will talk about that first. As a result of the Clinton budget. we saw 23 million new jobs created in this countrynot millions of jobs lost but 23 million jobs created. What happened to thedeficit under the Clinton budget? It went down. down. down. and we wound up with a surplus. We voted for the Clinton budget. the first Democratic budget in a while. and what happened? Twentythree million new jobs were created and the budget was in balance. As a matter of fact. George W. Bush. when he took the keys to the Oval Office. had a surplus. What happened with the Republican rule? Deficits as far as the eye can see. These are the facts. This isnt rhetoricdebt of $10 trillion. $11 trillion. Lets look at what the Republicans said about the Clinton budget that we know. because time has passed. history has shown. created 23 million jobs. stoppedothe deficits. turned them into surpluses. and got the debt going on the way down. What did our Republican friends say then? Wayne Allard said then as a Representative: In summary. the plan has a fatal flawit does not reduce the deficit. Wrong. Wrong. Wayne Allard continued: So we are still going to pile up some more debt. but most of all. we are going to cost jobs in this country. That is what Republican Wayne Allard said about the Clinton budgetwe are still going to pile up some more debt. but most of all. we are going to cost jobs . Wrong23 million jobs created. Senator Pete Domenici said of the Clinton budget that created 23 million jobs and turned the deficit into a surplus: Its just a mockery. Our friend. Senator ORRIN HATCH. a leader of the Republicans. still here and going strong. I am happy to say. he is my friendhe said: Make no mistake. these higher rates will cost jobs. Talking about the Clinton budget and the taxes in it. Make no mistake. these higher rates will cost jobs. Wrong23 million jobs created. How about Senator Phil Gramm. one of the leaders of the Republicans in the Senate at the time of the Clinton budget that created 23 million jobs. took the deficit. turned it into surplus. what did he say? I want to predict here tonight that if we adopt this bill. the American economy is going to get weaker and not stronger. the deficit 4 years from today will be higher than it is today and not lower .... When all is said and done. people will pay more taxes. the economy will create fewer jobs. Government will spend more money. and the American people will be worse off. Wrong. Phil Gramm was wrong. Oh. Phil Gramm. he is the one who said this recession was in our minds. Here is another quote of Phil Grammremember. he was a leader of the Republicans thentalking about the Clinton budget that created 23 million jobs and cut our deficit and turned it into a surplus: * . [T]his program is going to make the economy weaker. . . Hundreds of thousands of people are going to lose their jobs as a result of this program. Guess what he afso said: I believe that hundreds of thousands of people are going to lose their jobs as a result of this program. I believe that Bill Clinton will be one of those people. Bill Clinton got reelected and the economy created 23 million jobs. the deficits went down. we had a surplus. and the debt was almost eviscerated. What did our good friend CHUCK GRASSLEY say? CHUCK GRASSLEY is our good friend. He has taken a lead against this budget document. He is one of the leaders against the Obama budget. Lets see what he said about the Clinton budget that created 23 million new jobs and cut the deficits. turned them into surpluses. and had the debt going down. one of the most prosperous. times in our history as a result of the Clinton budget. What did CHUCK GRASSLEY say? I really do not think it takes a rocket scientist to know this bill will cost jobs. Wrong. Connie Mack. another leader. a friend of mine. now retired. a Republican leaderthis is what he said about the Clinton budget: This bill will cost America jobs. no doubt about it. Bill Roth said: It will flatten the economy .... I am concerned what it will do to jobs. I am concerned what it will do to our families. our communities. to our childrens future. Senator Roth was wrong23 million jobs created. one of the most prosperous times in our Nations history. deficits- went down. debt on the way out. So our Republicans have a visceral reaction when there is a Democratic President. They come and they excoriate our Democratic President. and they are wrong. They are wrong. Look at the record. This is the beauty of what I am saying. I do not have to defend it. I know what they said. and I know what happened to the economy. Newt Gingrichstill a major leader in the Republican Party. some people say the leaderabout the Democratic Presidents budget. Bill Clinton: ""It will kill jobs."" Wrong. It will ""lead to a recession. and the recession will force people off of work and onto unemployment and will . . . increase the deficit."" Wrong. John Kasichwe have seen him on television a lot. He was a leader then in the Republican Party. This is what he said about Bill Clintons budget. not dissimilar to the Barak Obama budget in the sense that it is a plan to cut the deficit and make investmentsmake good investments. This is what he said: This plan will not work. If it was to work. Id have to become a Democrat... John. if you are watching me. it is your time because the plan worked23 million jobs. You didnt become a Democrat. You said you would. Peter Kingwhat did Peter King say about the Clinton budget that created 23 million jobs and cured the deficit problem? [Ilt is because of budgets such as this that the economy is going to be damaged. Wrong. Wrong. Flash forward. We know what happened under Bill Clinton. We know about the 23 million jobs. We know what happened to the debt. It went down. We know what. happened to the deficits. They -turned into surpluses. George W. Bush takes the White House. the Republicans take over. and what happened? The worst recession since the Great Depression. terrible loss of jobs. deficits record high. which they never complained about. debt record high. We get a new President who comes in and says: I have a plan to turn it all around. What do they do? They come down to the floor with the same old politics. If I gave you the quotes I am hearing of my colleaguesSenator SHELBY is all over. they are all over the placedisaster. -Armageddon. the world is ending. we are going to lose jobs. we are going to have deficits as far as the eye can see. what a nightmare. It is the same old politics and. by the way. the same old policies. which is tax breaks for the wealthiest among us. shorting the investments that the people of this country need. not tackling health care. not tackling energy. not tackling educationall the things this President wantsnot tackling the deficits. and we have to know they got us into this crisis. . I do not enjoy reiterating all of this because it brings back some fights I was in. But I am going to do it every day as long as I hear the same rhetoric. the same politics. the same policies that got us into this mess in the first place. The American people had a choice in November. They had a choice in Senate races. they had a choice in House races. they had a choice in the Presidential race. Did they want the same old politics. did they want the same old policies that got us into the crisis? Guess what they said. They wanted change. and they are getting change. We have the same rhetoric flowing from my friends on the other side of the aisle. I thought they were going to change the image of their party. I thought they were going to change the message of their party. It is the same old stuff. You could substitute a name . for a name. It is the same thing they are saying about the Barak Obama budget that they said about the Clinton budget. and it doesnt fly because our new President understands we have to make some changes. He understands we need to invest in Americas future. in jobs. in health care. in energy independence. and in education. We know the deficit predictions are different coming out of the Congressional Budget Office than they are coming out of the White House office. Everybody knows we are going to adjust this budget here and there to make sure the numbers reflect reality. This President understands that. I watched him at his press conference. He said: What I care about is jobs. health care. energy independence. education. and deficit reduction. he added. That is a major focus of his agenda. He says: As long as I get jobs. health care. energy independence. education. -and deficit reduction. I am a happy person. The President is coming today to the Hill to meet with us. I am very much anticipating his presentation. We know what this President inherited. We know the fiscal mismanagement. We know the misplaced priorities. We know. we know. we know. The American people understand that is why this President. despite getting pounded day after day on this floor. on the airwaves. and on conservative talk shows. is still maintaining a strong majority of Americans who say: Give this man a chance. Who else in history inherited two wars and the biggest economic nightmare since the Great Depression? Nobody. The wars were not of his making. and the economic mess is not of his making. He is addressing them. He addressed it in the stimulus package that is going to start to pay off for us. It is tough times. but he is doing what has to be done. He went forward and he said: You know what. I have a plan to get these banks on their feet. He was honest. He said: I have bad choices and worst choices. If there is a tragedy in our families and we find out one of our loved ones has cancer and the doctor comes to us and says: There are two treatments. There is a tough chemotherapy treatment and there is a tough radiation treatment. You have to pick between those two treatments to cure this cancer. It is a hard choice. Our President faces very hard choices when it comes to straightening out this mess. But the American people want him to try and try he is. If we can get these bad assets off the hands of these banks and get them lending again. we basically save the financial system. If we donit save the financial system. we are going to have to take it over. This President does not want to do that and I do not want to do that and I do not think most Americans want that. So he is doing what it takes. The housing crisisI am so happy to hear people are refinancing. It is very important. That is going to put more money in the pockets of people. It is going to make it more affordable for them to stay in their homes. Our President has a budget blueprint to get us out of this mess. We all know he is not going to get every line in there he wants. He knows that. Senator CONRAD is working with him. We will have a reserve fund in there for the things we want to do for health care and energy. and I am going to work very hard so we can. in fact. have a capandtrade system .that brings funding in and puts people to work. it gets us off dirty. energy. We will have the ability to do that. The point is. this President deserves to have his priorities in place. I wish to say in closing to my Republican friends: Go back a few years in time. See how wrong you were. Admit that you were wrong. Then go back and see what you said about the Bush budget. I didnt get a chance to go through those quotes. I will do that the next time I take the floor. When the Bush budget came down and we saw what happened with the Bush budgets. they were adopted by Republicans. and they received lots of votes from their side. unanimous. All we had outof that was unemployment and deficits. They said: Oh. this is going to be a great budget. They are wrong. They have been wrongwrong on the Clinton budget. wrong on the Bush budget. and now they are wrong on the Obama budget. As one Senator. I wish to say this: I never forget. I forgive all the time. but I never forget. I have these quotes. They are real. They are in the RECORD. I am going to bring them out constantly. Remember. when you hear these Republicans come out and trash Barak Obamas budget. it is the same thing they did to the Clinton budget aid they were wrongwrong then and they are wrong now. We have to give this President the support he needs. Not that we are going to give every lineI dont agree with every line in itbut basically the thrust of what he wants. the investments and the deficit reduction. Mr. President. Iyield the floor. and I suggest the absence of a quorum.",111118701,BOXER,BARBARA,S,CA,F,D,,voting,2009-03-25,14,Mrs. BOXER,234,702,03252009.txt,15444,2863,111,2009,came floor talk budget debat think

1110050104,It occurs to me. if you think about the flow and the continuum of history. all of the czars were precursors to the Marxist era of Russia. So I dont know if this is any kind of thing we ought to.be thinking about. but the implications that come with the nomenclature here of these people who are supposed to be managing these jobs for which we already have people to do causes me to think: Is this a precursor for whats happening in a nation that has seen our major industries nationalized? Fannie Mae and Freddie .Macnationalized. Large investment banksnationalized. The largest insurance companynationalized. I didnt see any czar here for denationalization. for one thing. Im looking for that. Id like to appoint that czar of denationalization. I could find just about anybody on the Republican side of the aisle who would make a good denationalization czar because. you know. Ill present this list thats in. my head but thats not very well refined. and maybe well get it a little better. It just occurs to me that there are. oh. 6. 7. 8. 9 or 10 different things that President Obama has engaged in without an exit strategy. That would bethe nationalization of a list of our major investment banks. I dont know how many that isfour or five perhaps. It would be the nationalization of the largest insurance company. AIG. It would be the nationalization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. So I may be up to about eight. We ought to research this list a little bit before we publish it as the final total because I could surely forget some. Now Im to 8. 9 and 10. Lets put down Chrysler Motors and General Motors while were at it. When you end up with a 60 percent share in General Motors that the taxpayers are holdingthats the American taxpayersand another 12.5 percent held by the Canadian taxpayers. that would be 72.5 percent of General Motors that is owned by government. It would be 17.5 percent owned by the unions. and it would be. I think. around 12.5 percent owned by the bondholders. the part they were able to hold together of their secured interest. Yes. we need a czar to figure out an exit strategy for all of these things that President Obama has engaged in without an exit strategy. It occurs to me that he was elected as President of the United States. in part. because of his relentless criticism of President Bush for going into Iraq without an exit strategy. Now Ive justnamed 10 things that he has entered into without an exit strategy. By the way. for all of them. he said. I dont want the government to own them. and I dont want to have. to manage them. and its not my business to do so. Turn around the next week and nationalize somethin else. Do a photo op with Hugo Chavez. That great nationalizer in Venezuela appears to me to be a piker compared to the one we have in the White House. As for these 22 czars that we have. the ones that stand out and get my attention are. for example. the executive pay czarthe payroll czarthe guy who sits there and figures out Joes making too much money and Shannons making enough. and we need to have some more people out here who are sacrificing for the good of the whole. I look at that. Then as I understood this. too. it went beyond those who had taken Federal money. but they were going to at least look at executive pay in all of the large corporationsat the CEOsand make sure that that wasnt out of proportion. Do you remember that number? About $500.000 is plenty enough for anybody to make in a year or so. I think. theoretically. you could put a cap on all of that. Its harder to do so if there isnt Federal money involved. but its not impossible to do so if you look at some of the impossible things that have already been accomplished by this administration.,111120060,KING,STEVE,H,IA,M,R,5,voting,2009-06-15,355,Mr. KING of Iowa,21429,21533,06152009.txt,3730,685,111,2009,occur think flow continuum histori czar precursor marxist era russia dont know kind thing ought tobe think implic come nomenclatur peopl suppos manag job alreadi peopl caus think precursor what happen nation seen major industri nation fanni mae freddi larg invest largest insur didnt see czar one thing im look id like appoint czar could find anybodi republican side aisl would make good czar know ill present list that head that well refin mayb well get littl better occur oh differ thing presid obama engag without exit strategi would beth nation list major invest bank dont know mani five perhap would nation largest insur compani aig would nation fanni mae freddi mac may eight ought research list littl bit publish final total could sure forget im let put chrysler motor gener motor end percent share gener motor taxpay american taxpayersand anoth percent held canadian taxpay would percent gener motor own govern would percent own union would think around percent own bondhold part abl hold togeth secur interest ye need czar figur exit strategi thing presid obama engag without exit strategi occur elect presid unit state part relentless critic presid bush go iraq without exit strategi ive thing enter without exit strategi way said dont want govern dont want manag busi turn around next week nation els photo op hugo chavez great nation venezuela appear piker compar one white hous czar one stand get attent exampl execut pay payrol guy sit figur joe make much money shannon make enough need peopl sacrif good whole look understood went beyond taken feder money go least look execut pay larg make sure wasnt proport rememb number plenti enough anybodi make year think theoret could put cap harder isnt feder money involv imposs look imposs thing alreadi accomplish administr,308,FALSE
1110071031,"My answer to that is they are objective. That is why we did not get this reportI have the same copy my colleague from Arizona has. This just came out. and the reason is because they wanted to take the time to study the bill which they got in the middle of November. So they needed the time to actually go through point by point what the implications were. The Senator talked about the one segment where they talk about they ""face a significant risk of failure."" They actually go on to say: ""This will eventually trigger an insurance death spiral."" This is for people who depend upon Medicare for their health care. There is an Associated Press story out today that says this provides a sober warninga sober warningtoday to Members of the Senate. This is a time when the Senate raised the debt limit in this country by over $1 trillion. As the old saying goesI say to my friend who served in the Navythey are spending money like drunken sailors. and yet they want to keep the bar open longer. They want to increase the debt at a time when our Nation cannot afford it. when we have 10 percent unemployment. The folks who know Medicare the best and can look at this objectively and share with the American people what their beliefs are as to what the impact is going to be say that is going to be devastating for patients who rely on Medicare for their health careour seniorsand devastating for small community hospitals. I see the former Governor. now Senator of Nebraska. is here. and he knows. as I do from Wyoming. the impact on our small community hospitals. But as the Senator from Tennessee said. this is all being done in a back room. We are not privy to the newest changes. which I think are actually going to make matters worse. The New York Times today says Democrats new ideas would be even more expensive. Questions exist about the affordability. What we are dealing with is a situation that is unsustainable. and that is why the newest poll out today by CNNcertainly not biased one way or the otherfinds that 61 percent of Americans oppose this bill.

1110033768,Mr. President. I was saddened to learn about the passing of a man who gave many long years of dedicated service to this Capitol. If you only know this Senate through CSPAN. it is likely you never saw Steve. But if you had the privilege to work in this beautiful building. Steves work was indispensible. Steve was a valued member of the Senate Sergeant at Arms Capitol Facilities team for 32 yearssince he was 20 years old. He was part of the team of hardworking men and women who care for this historic building. If a room in the Capitol needed to be set up for a meeting. set up again an hour later for a hearing. and set up again for a reception. you knew you could count on Steve to do the work right. and on time. When a filibuster seemed imminent. Steve was part of the crew that would retrieve the cots from storage and set them up in the Capitoljust in case. Steves willingness to be helpful was invaluable. Not long after I moved into my office on the third floor of the Capitol. Steve was in my office to install a rug. He saw that there was a problem. He told my staff that he had seen the problem in another officethe way the rug was to be laid out. visitors would trip on the corner of the rug and might fall. This was just one example of how Steve cared for this institution and the people who visited this building every day. Whatever it took to make this Capitol work for visitors and employees. Steve didwith pride and professionalism. Steve was a friendly man who liked almost everyoneexcept the Dallas Cowboys. He was a generous man who never called attention to his generosity. If a coworker needed a ride. Steve was the first to offer. He brought Easter baskets to his friends children. Steve Mosley died suddenly and unexpectedly Wednesday night of a heart attack. I join my colleagues and all who work in this Capitol in offering our deep condolences to Steves wife of 26 years. Michelle. and their only child. Steven Jr.. whose 25th birthday is today. He was much admired and he will be much missed. in this Capitol and among those who knew him.,111118321,DURBIN,RICHARD,S,IL,M,D,,voting,2009-04-24,33,Mr. DURBIN,2434,2502,04242009.txt,2068,384,111,2009,mr presid sadden learn pass man gave mani long year dedic servic capitol know senat cspan like never saw steve privileg work beauti build steve work indispens steve valu member senat sergeant arm capitol facil team yearssinc year old part team hardwork men women care histor build room capitol need set meet set hour later hear set recept knew could count steve work right time filibust seem immin steve part crew would retriev cot storag set case steve willing help invalu long move offic third floor capitol steve offic instal rug saw problem told staff seen problem anoth officeth way rug laid visitor would trip corner rug might fall one exampl steve care institut peopl visit build everi day whatev took make capitol work visitor employe steve pride profession steve friendli man like almost dalla cowboy gener man never call attent generos cowork need ride steve first offer brought easter basket friend children steve mosley die suddenli unexpectedli wednesday night heart attack join colleagu work capitol offer deep condol steve wife year michel child steven jr whose th birthday today much admir much miss capitol among knew,190,FALSE

1110060924,Mr. Speaker. House Resolution 599 was introduced by our colleague from Massachusetts. Representative ED MARKEY. and would recognize the 50th anniversary of the establishment of Minute Man National Historical Park in Concord. Massachusetts. Minute Man National Historical Park was established 50 years ago yesterday. It preserves for Americans and the world the places and the landscapes along the route from Boston to Concord. known as the Battle Road. where the first battles of our War of Independence were fought. The park also memorializes the renowned American soldiers. the Minutemen. trained volunteers who were always ready to march at a minutes notice. Mr. Speaker. House Resolution 599 commemorates the enduring legacy of this Nations fight for freedom. liberty and democracy and pays tribute to a park that celebrates the birthplace of American independence. I commend Representative MARKEY and his cosponsor. Representative NIKI TSONGAS. for their timely and diligent work on this resolution. I ask my colleagues to support passage of this measure.

1110000537,"Mr. President. we are going to be in a weekend session. All Democratic Senators have been told this. and Republican Senators have been notified. We earlier anticipated that the vote would be early Sunday. but I have worked with the Senate staff and we are going to be protected with postcloture time by having that vote at 2 p.m. So what we will do is come in Sunday at 1 p.m. and have a vote at 2 p.m. There are a few procedural games people can play. if they desire. and I am confident they wont. but if they do. we are protected. and we will have that vote so that the 30 hours expires during the next day. which would be Monday. We are working toward not being in session on Saturday. We think we can do that because some people have issues that they want to be protected. and I think we can do that. But at least for nownot for now. periodwe are going to vote at 2 p.m. on Sunday. and everyone should know that. I know there are a lot of people who have plans. but there has been adequate notice. I mentioned here this morning. and I repeat. that Presidentelect Obama has said that there are people out there who would love to be able to work on a Sunday but they do not have a job. and this is the least we can do. The reason we are doing it is we have to move this large number of issues as quickly as we can. This one matter we will finish early next week will be the result of 164 bills that have been held up. We are going to move then to Lilly Ledbetter. an important piece of legislation. When we finish that. we are going to do the childrens health initiative. which doesnt take care of all the health care problems in this country. but it does solve the problem for millions of our children. Then we are going to ""move to the economic recovery plan. and there may be other things we have to do. For example. if President Bush sends us the TARPthat is the matter dealing with the financial bailoutwe will have to deal with that.

1110038213,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of the National Day of Prayer. which will be observed tomorrow. which has been celebrated every year in this country since 1952. On this day. we give thanks and prayer to the blessings that God has bestowed on America. We take comfort in knowing that throughout American history. our Creator has not been neutral in our struggles. For centuries. since Americas earliest settlement. prayer and a vigorous faith have marked our national journey. Our Founding Fathers sought His guidance during the early days of our young Republic. Other than Scripture. perhaps the greatest words ever written are from our Declaration of Independence: ""We hold these truths to be selfevident. that all men are created equal. that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights. that among these are Life. Liberty. and the pursuit of Happiness."" Founded on these trusts. our Nations reliance on God and JudeoChristian principles have allowed us to become the greatest force for good in history. Faith in God is the cornerstone of us being a good people and will continue to keep us a great Nation. Tomorrow. millions of Americans will take time out of their day to celebrate the National Day of Prayer. As Americans. we have much to be thankful for. It is appropriate that we have set aside a day for public recognition that is not by our own hands. but by our Creators. that our Nation has prospered and our people are free. When we stray from our founding principles based on timeless JudeoChristian truths and informed by centuries of Western thought. we become a Nation adrift. without purpose and without destination. Tomorrow. .we will affirm the importance of prayer in our national life. We will recognize that the institutions of family and marriage are foundational. and that God and prayer most certainly have a place in the public square. It is a disappointment. then. that President Obama is choosing not to participate in the National Day of Prayer as his predecessors before him have done. This action sends the wrong message to the American people. Instead of publicly joining millions of Americans in praying for our Nation. President Obama has chosen to distance himself from this important event by merely issuing a proclamation from the White House. It is my hope that in the future. President Obama will take a more active role in the National Day of Prayer. In conclusion. Mr. Speaker. I would like to thank the many people who make this event possible each year. I invite all of my colleagues to use this day to reflect on the need of prayer in their own lives and. just as importantly. the continuing need for prayers for our Nation. Ronald Reagan said it best when he remarked that when we stop being one Nation under God. we will be a Nation gone under.

This is a man who was voted dne of the 10 greatest coaches of the NBAs first half century in 1996. 2 years after being inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. He was the first basketball coach to win both NBA and Olympic titles. and he led the Dream Team to gold in the 1992 Olympics. Daly. who died May 9 at the age of 78 in Jupiter. Florida. will be honored by basketball legends and eulogized by members of professional teams. But in Pennsylvania. we remember that he was born in St. Marys.

1110069937,Madam Chairman. this was a very close vote in the committee and a highly contested issue. and I understand that there are hard and good feelings on both sides. I think the proponents of the amendment that carried in the committee. which now this amendment is trying to reverse here on the floor. were trying to say that government is hurting. in some way. small companies. about 5.000 of them. if we continue to impose 404(b). Thats not correct. First and foremost. 404(b). to the companies that are less than $75 million in capitalization are not presently compelled to follow any of the existing SarbanesOxley proposals. As a matter of fact. in the underlying bill. it wont be until 2011 that there will be an imposition of that. and only after a study that has already been ordered is made. which. as the chairman of the full committee recognized in his presentation. is that we will have plenty of time. that if that study comes back and says we should make adjustments to 404(b). well be able to do that. The problem of our friends like Mr. Levitt. Mr. Volcker. and many other leading economists in the country and people of high position in economics. they know that for 20 years there has been a fight in this country to try and protect investors from unscrupulous activity. We saw. 7 years ago. Enron and WorldCom. and thats the genesis of where this rule came from. To now summarily reverse this rule because its not very nice to have companies spend money to protect their shareholders is very appealing. I havent any doubt that it will appeal. But were not talking aboutwhen our adversaries on this particular proposition talk about small business. this isnt small business. These are companies that are registered public companies on the stock exchange and have up to $75 million in capitalization. Thats a pretty large company in most places.

1110021448,"Mr. President. I rise to talk about the pending bill. I understand we will have a unanimous consent agreement that the majority leader and I have worked out on the omnibus lands package. Having spent 10 years in a legislative body. I understand how things work. and I know we have a bill that is a compilation of 150plus other bills that is so peppered with individual parochial interests that the hopes of defeating the bill are somewhat diminished. However. I would be remiss in the oath I took to the Constitution to not try to inform my colleagues in the Senate as well asand more importantlythe people of this country what is coming about with this bill. Yesterday. one of my constituents sent me a news article described as the following: ""Natural Gas Rig Shutting Means Prices May Double."" Natural gas right now is under $4 a million British thermal units. It was as high as $13 in the height of what J would say was the manipulation of the commodity market but also in the height of the expansion we saw in economies around the world. Why is that important to the American public? When people look for natural resources. they look for natural resourcesto find themso they can sell them at a profit. Natural gas exploration in the continental United Statesnot offshoreis fraught with great difficulties in terms of finding great supplies. However. what we do know in terms of the law of economics is: If you cut exploration in natural gas by 45 percentand that is just through February of this year versus July of last yearwhat is going to happen? What is going to happen to natural gas prices? Well. they are going to rise and they are going to rise significantly and. most probably. they are going to approach $10 a year from now. Is it a great policy we are going to pass a bill that is going to make it harder to find additional natural gas resources in this country. that shuts off 13 trillion cubic feet of known reserves right now? That is enough to supply our country for 2 years. Is it smart for us to pass a lands package that is going to take 2.8 million acres and say: You cannot ever touch it for energy. regardless if natural gas is $45 a million Btus. you cannot touch it? But at the same time. if our demand rises. what are We going to do? We are going to import it. So we are doing two things highly negative in the long run that will have major effects on the average American family. One is. we are going to limit the ability to go find it. and. No. 2. we are going to continue to fund imports with our dollars to burn the same natural gas we could have developed here. The same thing could be said for oil. We all remember oil at $140 a barrel. We pretty well like that gasolinein my hometown. I filled up with regular unleaded gasoline for $1.64 a gallon this weekend versus the highest it got in Oklahoma. I think. was $3.90 a gallon. We like that. But we are getting ready to pass a bill that says the likelihood of us going back to that era of demandsupply inequalitywill be increased and that to pay for that will be a tax on every American familys budget. It is a pretty tough tax if you are commuting or if you are heating your home with natural gas our if you are buying heating oil. Many of our families in the Northeast and upper Midwest bought their heating oil at the peak of prices. So the opposition to this bill. from my standpoint. comes from a lot of areas. and I am going to spend some time outlining that today. But I want to be a predictor of what is going to happen. What is going to happen is energy prices are going to rise. If you are the greenest of green and think we can provide all our energy from renewables. great. But what you cannot deny is the fact that it is going to take us 20 years to get there. What this bill is going to do is markedly hamper our ability to supply needed energy products for American families. It is not just oil and gas. Ninety percent of the known geothermal and absolutely clean. safe. environmentally friendly way to produce steam and power a turbine to produce electricity is taken off in this bill90 percent of the known geothermal reserves. So when we say we want to use renewables and we want to get away from a carbonbased source. there are some things we have to do. One is to recognize how long it is going to take us and make sure we do not have a disruption in our supplies. No. 2. markedly increase the supplies we need in the meantime. and. No. 3. not hamstring our ability to use completely renewable sources from sources we know are available to us right now. There have been a lot of claims this bill is not controversial. Well. coming from an energyproducing State. it is controverqial as all get out for Oklahoma. When we say we are going to shut off large portions of this country forever to future energy exploration. it does not just impactOklahomans have cheap energy. We are the least impacted by it. What the American citizens ought to be asking is: What did we get individually that can put 150 bills together that will make your Representative in Congress vote for something that in the long term is damaging to our energy independence and will keep us more dependent on people who are supplying energy who do not necessarily believe in freedom. do not necessarily like our way of life. and do not necessarily believe we ought to have the standard of living we have? This bill has 1.248 pages--.248 pages. There is a total of 170 unique. different bills. This bill. also. is going to cost the American taxpayerour kids--S10 billion. and it has $900 million of mandatory spending that is going to be spent no matter what anybody in Congress says. So we are going to add another $11 billion to our spending. It is opposed by over 200 different groups. Whether it is property rights groups. the Chamber of Commerce. energyproducing groups. recreation interests across the country. they are uniform in their opposition to this bill. It is not necessarily just in their own selfinterests they are in opposition to it. They know what is coming. They are not thinking short term. They are not thinking about how I look good at home. They are thinking about what is in the best longterm interests of our Nation. One hundred of these bills have no effect on us as individual Americans. They will not have an effect on energy. They will not have an effect on property rights. There probably is no problem .with them. But 70 of these bills will markedly impact every American. When this bill went through the House on suspensionand it is important you know what ""suspension"" means: You get a vote on it. but you do not get any opportunity to amend itit did not pass the requirement to pass the House without amendment. This bill has been smoldering here for 2 years. I wish it would smolder a whole lot longer. I will have to admit that. This is the first time in 2 years we are going to be able to offer an amendment to change this bill. It is going to be a limited set of amendments: six amendments on 1.248 pages of legislation. on $11 billion worth of spending. but. more importantly. on a significant decline in the American peoples standard of living because energy costs are going to rise. They are going to rise anyway. but they are going to rise dramatically because of what we are going to do in this bill. It is a massive collection of unique provisions. some quite controversial. There is actually a section of wilderness area in one Congressmans district that nobody from his district wants and neither did he. but it got put in the bill. and he has no ability to amend the bill. So we are going to take a section out of one of our States and put it in a wilderness area. where the citizens do not want that to happen and the Congressman does not have the ability to try to stop it. That is what happens when you start playing games in trading things in Congress to pass a bill that cannot pass any other way except for buying off votes with something that looks good at home. It creates 10 new National Heritage Areas. It creates three new units of the National Park Service. We have a $9 billion backlog in just keeping the buildings maintained in our national parks right now. and we are going to add three new parksat a time when we are going to have an over $2 trillion deficit. We are going to have a deficit that will add $7.000 per man. woman. and child. $28.000 per family this year alonethis year alone. It creates 14 new studies to expand or create more national parks. It creates 80 new wilderness designations or expansions. It takes 2.2 million acres of direct Federal land and says: You can never touch this. regardless of how much oil is there. how much natural gas is there. how much geothermal is there. You can never touch it. No matter what our need is. we will never be able to access it. How stupid are we when we are going to tell the rest of the worlds suppliers of oil we are going to limit our ability to influence their pricing to us? It creates 92 wild and scenic river designationsthat is more than we have total wild and scenic rivers now1.100 miles of shoreline. It is going to kill an LNG. liquefied natural gas. port in Massachusetts that is not a scenic river at all because we are so green we do not want to use natural gas. one of the cleanest carbonbased fuels we have. and we are going to eliminate the ability for people in the Northeast to have cheap natural gas. But we are going to do it. It creates six new National Trails. I will tell you. the trails it creates have eminent domain. Even though this bill says they are not going to use it. the bureaucrats are still going to have the ability to take private property from individuals without their consent. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act will prohibit any gas transmission lines. any electrical lines. any utility lines. that may be in our Nations best interest. to either pump oil from Canada or natural gas. You cannot go near the river. so you cannot cross the river. So what we are going to do is. not only are we going to raise the cost. we are going to increase the cost of getting it here because we are going to have to go circuitous routes to bring energy to people in this country. It includes 19 specific instances where Federal lands are permanentlypermanentlywithdrawn from future mineral and geothermal leasing. Three million acres are impacted by this permanent withdrawal. In the Wyoming Range that is in this bill. according to the National Petroleum Council. 12 trillion cubic feet of natural gas is proven and sitting there right nowand that is enough to run our country for almost 3 years300 million barrels of oil. That is the most uptodate study by the BLM. Each of the 19 withdrawal provisions of the 3 million acres also excludes future geothermal leasing. Studies performed by the Bureau of Land Management confirm geopotential on many of the designations in this bill. In other words. it has been studied. I will have a chart later to show that. We know where the geothermal sources are in this countryclean energy. cheap. abundantyet we are going to take it away. We are going to say we are not going to use it. The threats posed by this bill to American energy independence have grown since the last time we considered this bill. Secretary Salazar has withdrawn 77 major leases in Utah. He has withdrawn eightand these are leases that are already completed. signed. and paid forenergy leases in Wyoming. outside of this bill. He has delayed any increase in offshore drilling because it ""needs more study."" We do it with perfection in the Gulf of Mexico. The vast quantity of our oil that we produce domestically comes from there. He has delayed the development of oil shale because it needs more testing. except all the prototype plants have bben highly effective in how they have utilized it. The bill is another direct challenge from Congress to President Obamas pledge to clean up the earmark process. There are multiple earmarks in this bill for things that none of us would be proud of and none of us would say would meet with any common sense. especially in light of the fiscal and monetary difficulties in which we find ourselves. There is $1 billion for a water project in California to repopulate 500 salmon. There is $5 million for a wolf compensation and prevention program for wolves that we reintroduced in the wild that are now killing cattle. So we are reintroducing wolves. and then we are going to pay the ranchers for the cows the wolves killed. There is $3.5 million to celebrate the 450th anniversary of St. Augustine in 2015. Do we really think right now we ought to spend $3.5 million to plan a birthday party in 2015 when we are stealing every penny we are going to spend this yearin the remaining portion of this yearfrom our kids and our grandkids? Is that really something we want to do? We are going to spend a quarter of a million dollars to study whether Alexander Hamiltons boyhood estate in St. Croix. the U.S. Virgin Islands. is suitable as a new national park. Well. lets do it after we get out of the mess we are in. lets dont do it now. Lets not spend a quarter of a million dollars. What would a quarter of a million dollars do? It would buy at least 20 families health insurance for a year. 20 families who dont have it. It would supply lots of small businesses with the working capital they require to keep going and keep their employees on board instead of laying them off. This bill gives $5 million for the National Tropical Botanical Garden to operate and maintain new gardens in Hawaii and Florida. Is that really a priority for us right now? Is that somethingif we were a family. would we be making those kinds of decisions? It gives us a new ocean exploration program which has as its No. 1 job to locate. find. and document historic shipwrecks. It may be a good idea in a time of plenty. but in a time of hurt it is a terrible idea. There is $12 million for the Smithsonian to build a new greenhouse for a national orchid collection. Is that something we should do now? A full waiver for the Cave Institute in New Mexico to be fully funded by the American taxpayers rather than by the State of New Mexico. It just happens to be one of those little things snuck into the bill. What about property rights? There is little transparency. It is estimated the Federal Government now owns 653 million acres. 1 out of 3 acres in the United States. and 1 out of 2 acres in the Western United States. The 10 national heritage areaswhat does that mean? The Park Service funds advisory committees in these heritage areas which means they have an advantage over the local residents because they have money. So they come in and pass requirements and code changes that impact private property rights in all of these areas. So if you are in the heritage area or if you are abutting it. you now have the Federal Government funding a group that may be counter to your own private property rights. Eighty wilderness areas and another 2.2 million acres. Recent court decisions have now said being in the wilderness area isnt enough. If you are close to it. you cant have your rights. we will decide what you do with your land. Ninetytwo national -scenic riversagain. eminefit domainanything touching it or anything they want to have touch it. they have eminent domain to take private property. and we are creating 92 of those. So if you live along one of those rivers. you should worry about whether you are going to have the freedom to do with your property as you want. whether you are on the river or not. You just have to be in proximity. Six national trail designations. The underlying National Trails Act grants land acquisition and eminent domain authority. So if they want to put a na.tional trail through your backyard. they can come and take your home. Do we really want to give that kind of capability. and is now the time to do it? Here is a quote from the National Property Rights Advocates: This bill is a serious threat to all property owners in this country. Over the past several decades there has been a proliferation of programs dedicated to the preservation of land that has extended the grasp of the Federal Government and its influence over private property rights. Amen. As a result of this legislation. landowners will see their property value diminish due to increased land use regulations and outdoor recreation enthusiasts will find new restrictions on both public and private land. So you can have private land where you allow people to horseback ride. but if you are next to one of these areas and they are not allowed in that area. you are not going to be allowed. So you may actually even lose income because you no longer have that as a capability of your property. The experts go on and say: This legislation should never arbitrarily attempt to seize land from the public and restrict its use as this package will. The problem is. there is no priority in this billthere is no priority for energy independence or less dependence. There is no priority to protect rights that are guaranteed under the Constitution. Lets think for a minute about what we have tasked the American agencies with. The National Park Service. here is what they are responsible for: 84 million acres of land in the National Park Service. 391 different units. 54 national wilderness areas which include 44 million acres. 15 wild and scenic rivers. and we are getting ready to add 92 to that. 40 national heritage areas. and we are getting ready to add 12. 28 national memorials. 4 national parkways. 120 national historic parks. 20 national preserves and reserves. 24 national battlefields. 18 national recreation areas. 74 national monument areas. 10 national seashores. 4 national lake shores. 3.565 miles of national. scenic trails. 12.250 miles of unpaved trails. 46 miles of Canadian border. 285 miles of Mexican border to patrol and manage. 27.000 historic structures27.000 historic structures that are falling down26.830 camp sites. 7.580 administrative and public use buildings. 8.505 monuments and statues. 1.804 bridges and tunnels. 505 dams. 8.500 miles of road that they have to maintain yearly. 680 waste water treatment systems. and 272 million visits annually. . The National Park Service has a $9.6 billion maintenance backlog. so severe that the backlog grew $400 million since the time we first passed this bill and its coming back to us. The backlog has grown by $400 million. which includes some of our treasuresthe USS Arizona Memorial. where 1.117 American sailors were killedand faces a backlog of $33.4 million. It is not getting fixed. Gettysburg National Battlefield. 51.000 casualties in 3 days. $29 million backlog. the Grand Canyon National Park. $299 million backlog. the Statue of Liberty Park. $197 million backlog. The National Mall in Washington. DCThe Mall that is just west of here-$700 million backlog. There is even miscellaneous and supposedly noncontroversial provisions in the bill that could pose a threat to American families. It is not intended.- it is just that it is a consequence. In this bill is a little provision that if you are on Federal lands and you happen to pick up a rocknot intentionally to steal a fossil. but if it is a fossil. 5 years in jail. and they can confiscate your automobile. plus a fine. One of the amendments we have tries to fix that. We dont have a big problem with fossils being stolen. but we are going to fix a problem that isnt great by this amendment. by this bill. and we need to clean it up. There is a provision to codify an existing agency program at the Bureau of Land Management which will. in fact. consolidate power over 38 million acres of land onto a -few antienergy. antirecreational bureaucrats. This jurisdiction will extend the wilderness study areas lands. many of which have been deemed already nonsuitable for wilderness. I am going to make a point later in the presentation just to show my colleaguesas a matter of fact. I will make it right now. One of the things the law requires is that we. in fact. do studies on the applicability of lands for wilderness area. My staff just had time to go through California. Oregon. and Washington. By law. it is mandated there has to be a study to see if it is suitable. I am going tp read through some of these. Granite Mountain. CA. It is not suitable for wilderness recommendation because resource conflicts in the WSA include modern to high geothermal resource potential. It should never get k wilderness designation. We are going to designate it a wilderness area. Spring Basin. oil and gas. moderate potential for occurrence based on several factors. Soda Mountain wilderness study area. California. again. the entire wilderness is considered to have a moderate potential for the occurrence of. oil and gas. So we know in many of these areas there is tremendous energy potential for us. and we are going to shut it off forever. Sabinoso wilderness study area. oil and gas. Pinto Mountain. CA. zero acresthis is by the Bureau of Land Managementzero acres were deemed suitable for wilderness. Yet we are going to put that area in a Wilderness classification. Beauty Mountain. CA. no wilderness is recommended for this wilderness study area. The wilderness values for most of the area are not outstanding at all and commonplace. Little Jackson. Big Jackson. wilderness study area. Idaho. natural gas pipeline between it and a supposed source of minerals. Bruno River wilderness study area. geothermal resources are found at the northern and southern ends of it. The solitude of this area is frequently disrupted by flying military aircraft utilizing the U.S. Air Force bombing range just east of the wilderness study area. I can go through Oregon. Idaho. Washingtonand we will go through the rest of them before this debate is overbut the fact is. we are not even paying attention to what the law says. When we have a study that says we shouldnt be. we are putting them in wilderness areas anyway. One of the things I would like to do is commend to my colleagues highlights of GAO09425T. a study released March 3. 2009. on the Department of the Interior by the GAO. I would bet my colleagues a nickel against a penny. or any multiple of that. that less than one person in the Senate besides myself has read this report because you cant read this report and come out and vote on this bill. This is the Government Accountability Office. What they say is. the Department of the Interior is essentially poorly run. poorly managed. and the safety and welfare of our people who are on BLM lands and in the national parks is at risk because of the poor management and the lack of oversight that has been carried out by Congress. It is the very same committee that brings us this bill. Mr. President. I also commend to my colleagues the testimony of Mary Kendall. the acting inspector general for the Department of the Interior. her statement before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior. Environment. and Related Agencies. When you read it. it will scare you to death. Here is what the internal inspector general is saying. and it mirrors what the GAO is saying. Yet this has received zero consideration from the authors of this bill. otherwise. we would see an opportunity to fix the problems that are outlined in these two documents in this bill. There has been no consideration to fix the problems and no significant oversight. What does it find? At no point during their testimony did they agree that it was a good idea to add any additional responsibilities to the Department of the Interior. based on what has been found: We find ourselves in the biggest mess in terms of maintenance. There is actually a public safety and health issue for people who are visiting our parks highlighted throughout both of these reports. There is no attempt to fix that. no attempt to authorize the money to get the backlog caught up with what we presently have and should be taking care of. There is no attempt whatsoever. In the GAO report--I quoted almost $9 billionthey are saying it is between $13.2 billion and $19.4 billion to get our national parks up to date and manage the things we should be managing. In contrast. the entire budget for the Department of the Interior in 2007 was under $11 billion. We are going to take significant moneys that should be spent on the backlog of repair and maintenance and we are going to use that to implement this 1.243page bill. I dont get it. I dont understand the lack of common sense. I understand the political drive. I understand we want to do things for people back at home. But I dont understand why there hasnt been a change in behavior given the economic situation we arein. I flat dont get it. I guess I have a lot to learn about politics. The GAO wasnt necessarily critical of the management of the Department of the Interior. they were really critical of Congress. They said that although Interior has made a concentrated effort to address its deferred backlog. the dollar estimate of the backlog has continued to escalate. It sounds as if they need help. The last thing they need is another 3 million acres for.which they have to be responsible. They classify the backlog into four categories: roads. bridges. and trails. between $6 billion and $9 billion. building*. including historic buildings. between $2 billion and $3.5 billion. irrigation. dams. and other water structures. between $2.4 billion and $3.6 billion. recreation sites and fisheries. between $2 billion and $2.93 billion. The Department of Interior by itself manages more than 500 million acres of Federal land. more than 1.8 billion acres of the Outer Continental Shelf. and its 70.000 employees working in 2.400 locations. Yet congressional leadership intends to add another 3 million acres and hundreds of new commitments to DOI in this bill. In one instance of mismanagement. in this GAO report. GAO points out that the Fish and Wildlife Service is responsible for 132.000 acres of farmland. most of which it doesnt manage. However. even though these farmlands are unwanted. the Fish and Wildlife Service cannot sell these lands because they are now part of the National Wildlife Refuge System. So Fish and Wildlife owns thousands of acres of good farmland that it doesnt manage and doesnt even inspect. It is less than 13 percent of the land they inspect yearly. It is land we could use for agricultural production. butwe dont use it because we in the Congress have handicapped them. What the GAO report also said was. in describing the maintenance backlogs. that the deterioration of these facilities can impair public health and safety. reduce employee morale and productivity. and increase the cost for major repairs and early replacement of structures and equipment. Other groups have made similar observations. According to the National Parks Conservation Association. ""From neglected trails to dirty or deteriorating facilities. national parks across the country are showing the strain of budget shortfalls in excess of $600 million annually .. "" It will be greater than that this year. ""The visitor center at the USS Arizona Memorial in Hawaii is overcrowded. its foundation is cracking. and it is sinking. ... a shortage of staff and funding limits the ability of the Park Service to maintain campgrounds at Nevadas Great Basin National Park. Broken benches. dilapidated buildings. and a crumbling boardwalk greet visitors to Riis Park in Gateway National Recreation Area in New York and New Jersey. Chaco Culture National Historical Park in New Mexico lacks funding to maintain and repair the parks 28""miles of backcountry trails. As a result. trails are damaged by heavy use and weather. compromising the experiences of visitors and the integrity of cultural resources and nearby natural resources that become trampled when visitors cannot follow the trails."" They are not maintained. and that becomes an ecological problem. According to Acting IG Mary Kendall. ""Our work has documented decades of maintenance. health and safety issues that place the Department of Interior employees and the public at risk."" She listed the following examples of where poor management has led to safety concerns: The U.S. Park Police. responsible for maintaining security at national icons. ""failed to establish a comprehensive security program and lacks adequate staffing and formal training for those responsible for protection [of those assets]."" Opportunities for improvement remain in the security of our Nations dams. The Departments Office of Law Enforcement. Security. and Emergency Management still struggles with issuing centralized policy and providing effective oversight of DOI law enforcement. In 2006. they found a National Park Service visitor center literally falling apart. severe deterioration at the Bureau of Indian Education elementary and. secondary schools. and Fish and Wildlife employees working for almost 7 years in two buildings that were condemned and closed to the public. That is how good the oversight is that we have done. They identified abandoned mines where members of the public had been ""killed. injured. or exposed to dangerous environmental contaminants"" by abandoned mines. and Congress is prioritizing a massive increase in the public lands without funding or prioritizing the true national concerns in DOI. What was also found in the GAO report is that despite increasing firefighting funds fourfold. there is incompetent forest fire management. The fact is that they are made worse because of poor management. We have done nothing for that. Her statement was: In other words. DOI has not managed to even develop goals for maximizing fire management and prevention funds. Another statement is: High prevalence of waste and fraud in the procurement and Federal assistance process. They also found problems throughout the solicitation process: a lack of presolicitation planning. a lack of competition. selection of inappropriate award vehicles. and poor administration of contracts and grants. Mary Kendall said: Financial management has remained a top challenge for the department. Why dont we fix it? You rannot fix what you cannot measure. Yet we are going to add this bloated bill. There is something everybody should know. For the Native American schools in this country. we are §pending a billion dollars a year for 50.000 kids. And when you look at performance. what you see is something akin. in many areas. to Washington. DCnot all but in many. The cost per student running through that. is $20.000. We could put them in the best private schools. with the best private teachers. and bunk them. for $20.000 a year. Yet we continue to allow this. BLM grazing fees collected were $12 million in fiscal year 2004that is the latest year for which we have numbers. which tells you something about the accountingeven though the cost to implement the grazing program was $58 million. We would be better off eliminating the grazing program and saving $46 million. So what is it about this bill that has had me so persistent? I will tell you. It is a great example of what we do wrong. It is a great example of the worst tendency of Congress. We were in an energyshort environment. and even though it doesnt feel that way today. it will feel that way 10. 12. 18 months from now. We are going to eliminate the potential for us getting out of it. We are going to add significant responsibilities to an agency that both the GAO and their own IG says is in trouble. Yet we dont approach anything to fix it. We are going to make everybody feel good in this body because they all have something in the bill and they can go home and say: Look what I did. look what I accomplished. I got something that is important for our State. The problem with that thinking is that. when we only think in a parochial mannerif I only think about Oklahoma or if thd Senator from Texas only thinks about Texas or any other Senator thinks only about their State and themselves--the whole country loses. Not once in our oath does it say that our allegiance is to our State. What it says is that our allegiance is to our country. And if our country is not healthy. no State can be healthy. Yet we have allowed parochialism and the politics of the Senate to design a bill that. for sure. will pass but which in the long run is going to be harmful to the country. It is going to pass. It will have 65 or 70 votes. maybe even 80 votes. because the press release at home is more important than the principle in Washington. Consequently. not only will we spend this $11 billion and overburden an agency that is struggling to keep itself above water. we will commit the Department of Iuterior to further backlogs. further problems. and we will strangle our ability to respond both with clean energy and the energy we know we are going to need for the next 20 years the next time the supplydemand balance gets upset. The question the American people ought to ask is. Is it worth it? Is it worth it for somebody from Oklahoma to get something and to do this to the Nation as a whole? Is it responsible? Is that how our country is going to work in the future? Are we going to always place parochial interests first or are wegoing to go back and grab ahold of the heritage which made this country great. which says the politician doesnt matter. the principles and forbearance of our forefathers in accomplishing what is best for the nation. is that going to win the day? My thoughts are that it wont. When it doesnt win the day. I dont loseI fought for itbut my kids lose. my grandkids lose. and so does everybody else in this country. In the name of playing the good game. what we are doing is undermining our country. We have a lot of financial problems in front of us today. We as a nation can get out of those problems. As a matter of fact. we will get out of those in spite of the U.S. Congress because what makes America great is its people. not its politiqians. What makes America great is the fact that the people get up every day. and no matter what is ahead of them. they will struggle to try to defeat the problems in front of them to make a better life for themselves. their kids. and their neighbors. We could learn a great deal from the average American citizen as we approach the legislation. This little bill. which I assure you nobody in this body has read. is a compilation of 170 billssome good. some dont have any of the negative effects I have described. But 50 of them are going to have devastating effects. And how we respond. how the American people respond to our doing this. is going to reflect on the character of the American people. They need to become informed about what we are doing. Later today. we will have a unanimous consent that I thank the majority leader for. He has the toughest job in the Senate. and I recognize that. I have given him fits on this bill. I dont apologize for that. I think this bill is the wrong thing at the wrong time for the wrong reason. But we will have a unanimous consent agreement that allows six amendments. which I will offer either later this evening or tomorrow. which eliminate some of the stupidity in this bill. It wont fix the bill. It wont fix the problem I have described. We are then going to walk out of here happy. because it will go back to the House. not have a chance to be amended in the House. and the President is going to sign a bill that is going to hurt our energy independence. We are going to hear all sorts of statements to the contrary. but that is not true. The fact is it is going to hurt our capability of becoming more selfsufficient for our own energy needs. So a year or 18 months from now. when you are no longer paying under $2 for gasoline. and it is $4. I hope the American people will remember this bill. because this is the start of the battle against undermining utilizing our own resources in our own country for what is in the best longterm interestnot the shorttermfor our coun-. try. And it doesnt have anything to do with climate change or global warming. Because if it did. we wouldnt worry about 20 years of carbon usage when we know we are going to go away from it. Mr. President. I thank you for your patience and the time today.

1110071480,I thank the gentleman for yielding. Madam Speaker. I rise today also in support of this legislation to extend our trade preference programs. Trade is vital to creating jobs. growing our economy. and strengthening ties with key partners around the world. Preferences are a bridge for developing countries to enter the global market. to grow. and to achieve permanent trade relationships with America. Look no further than South Korea and Colombia for great examples of preferences done right. Through successful preference programs. both allies now stand ready to enter into permanent trade agreements with the United States. The failure to pass pending free trade agreements like those with Korea and Colombia is costing America thousands of jobs and billions of dollars. President Obama did recently speak about how growing exports creates jobs. and I hope the Congress will soon prepare these agreements for consideration. because not only do these agreements create jobs. but also business relationships and partnerships and friendships. It creates opportunities for cultural exchanges and the opportunities to help our friends across the globe educate each other and educate us. It also even affects our national security and our environment. While I am disappointed that we could not extend these preference programs beyond just 1 year. they are too important to our partner countries to let them expire. I urge all of my colleagues to support this extension of our preference programs.,111120950,REICHERT,DAVID,H,WA,M,R,8,voting,2009-12-14,17,Mr. REICHERT,881,923,12142009.txt,1491,234,111,2009,thank gentleman yield madam speaker rise today also support legisl extend trade prefer program trade vital creat job grow economi strengthen tie key partner around world prefer bridg develop countri enter global market grow achiev perman trade relationship america look south korea colombia great exampl prefer done right success prefer program alli stand readi enter perman trade agreement unit state failur pass pend free trade agreement like korea colombia cost america thousand job billion dollar presid obama recent speak grow export creat job hope congress soon prepar agreement consider agreement creat job also busi relationship partnership friendship creat opportun cultur exchang opportun help friend across globe educ educ us also even affect nation secur environ disappoint could extend prefer program beyond year import partner countri let expir urg colleagu support extens prefer program,133,FALSE
1110009096,Mr. Speaker. it is with great sadness that I rise today to mourn the passing of a dear friend. Raymond M. Fitzgerald. Although he lived in my congressional district in Naperville. Illinois. I got to know him best during his time here in Washington. He began his career as a legislative aid for our former Governor. He went on to work on the staff of the House Science and Technology Committee and as a legislative director to my good friend from Illinois. JOHN SHIMKUS. I know that today there are many still working here in Congress who knew him well and miss him as I do. Just a few years ago. Ray moved to Naperville with his wife Kristen to raise their three beautiful daughters. Nora. Maggie. and Lucy. But having taken a job in government relations for a major company in my district. he made regular trips back here to see all his good friends and colleagues. Mr. Speaker. Ray was a wonderful human being with a positive attitude and great talent for public service and science policy. He was always full of life and cheer. And in the short 37 years that he was with us before succumbing to cancer. he built a lasting legacy of friends. family. and professional success. Mr. Speaker.

1110073009,Madam Speaker. I had the opportunity to be with our resilient troops last week in Afghanistan near the violent southern border with Pakistan. Part of their mission is to secure the border by preventing drugs. arms. money and Taliban criminals from crossing back and forth through the vast border regions. Its in Americas interest to have our military in Afghanistan and protect the sovereignty of that country. It is ironic. however. we see the need to protect the borders of other nations. but because of political reasons. we dont have the moral will to protect our own borders. This is not the first administration that has given a wink and a nod to our porous borders. but it should be the last. Our southern border region is a haven for organized criminal cartels. gun smugglers. human smugglers and rogue outlaws that cross as freely as they did in the days of the old west. We should be as concerned about protecting our own border as we are about protecting the borders of Third World countries like Afghanistan. We should put our military on the border if necessary.

1110018022,Madam President. as we contemplate this 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act before us this week. I wish to look ahead to President Obamas proposed 2010 budget. As a proud member of the Veterans Affairs Committee. I am particularly pleased by the significant increase in funding that the administration is seeking for the Department of Veterans Affairs. led by its Secretary. GEN Eric Shinseki. : In the proposed 2010 budget. the Department of Veterans Affairs will see a $25 billion increase over the next 5 years. This additional funding will be directed toward a major expansion of benefits for those who serve our Nation in uniform. The 2010 budget will directly assist veterans by expanding access to highquality care for approximately 51/2 million veteran patients and ensuring that care is delivered in a timely manner. More remarkable. this funding establishes VA Centers of Excellence to provide veteranoriented care in specialized areas. such as prosthetics. vision. spinal cord injury. aging. and womens health. The Presidents budget also reaches out to veterans with moderate incomes. bringing an additional half million veterans into the VA system by 2013. while maintaining or expanding existing care for lowincome and disabled veterans. At the same time. the new budget enhances services related to mental health care and broadens access and treatment areas throughout rural America. Americas veterans have earned through their service the very best care we can offer. and the 2010 VA budget is a promising start. During a recent tour through Illinois. I had the remarkable opportunity to visit with both veterans of past service. as well as meeting the young recruits training to wear the American uniform in the years ahead. During that trip. I visited the 1082nd Airlift Wing of the Illinois Air National Guard located in Peoria. IL. and spoke with many fine airmen from this wing. including MSG Warren McCray. Master Sergeant McCray is an air guardsman who trained as a joint terminal attack controller. He deploys with Army troops on the ground ensuring that airpower can be employed against enemy positions when needed. This courageous young man has recently returned from a tour of.duty in Afghanistan and was awarded a Bronze Star with Valor. While speaking with Master Sergeant McCray. he told me of the multiple tours he had served as an air guardsman mobilized in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. I was deeply impressed by his professionalism and dedicated service to this country. Even more so by his dedication to his fellow service men and women of the 1082nd Airlift Wing. As we consider our mission abroad and weigh the cost in terms of troops and treasure. it is our duty to also consider the capacity at which these young men and women are serving us. It doesnt matter whether they are a soldier. sailor. airman. marine or Coast Guard. or whether they are Active Duty. Guard. or Reserve. We must never forget the personal toll and sacrifice of these brave Americans and the effects made on their lives. their future. their spouses. and their children. We must ensure that ourveterans receive superior accessible care in return for their service and sacrifice. and we have an obligation to honor our veterans by serving them in the same way they have served us so selflessly. The administrations 2010 budget for the Department of Veterans Affairs recognizes this. And in addition to expanding health benefits and high quality of care. the budget provides for comprehensive educational benefits. particularly the post9/l1 GI bill so that following their service. veterans can have access to unprecedented levels of educational support to complete their schooling. In the same week. I visited the Naval Station Great Lakes and the North Chicago VA Medical Center. During my visit to these sites. I learned about plans for the Naval Health Clinic Great Lakes. the North Chicago VA Medical Center to merge and expand over the next couple of years. This merger will be extensive and costly. but also essential for sailors and veterans of Illinois. many of whom spend much of their lives at these facilities. At the North Chicago VA Medical Center. I met with veterans of all ages and backgrounds. I heard their stories. their hopes. and their needs. At the Recruiting Training Command. I met with both naval officers and naval recruits and was given a tour of the barracks by LT Ellen McElligott. I was particularly impressed with Lieutenant McElligott. a Chicago native. who serves as the ships officer for the USS Arizona. Her professionalism. discipline. and enthusiasm for her work are qualities she shares with countless young service men and women across this great country of ours. While touring thb facility with Lieutenant McElligott. I saw the faces of hundreds of young sailors training so that they may one day serve this country. It is so very important that LT Ellen McElligott and the young men and women like her receive adequate care and compensation while on Active Duty. Guard. or Reserve. and. most importantly. that they receive the care and resources they deserve when they return from serving their country. As a nation. we have a moral obligation to serve and care for those brave individuals as they work so hard to serve us.,111116201,BURRIS,ROLAND,S,IL,M,D,,voting,2009-03-05,328,Mr. BURRIS,10837,10988,03052009.txt,5293,873,111,2009,madam presid contempl omnibu appropri act us week wish look ahead presid obama propos budget proud member veteran affair committe particularli pleas signific increas fund administr seek depart veteran affair led secretari gen eric shinseki propos budget depart veteran affair see billion increas next year addit fund direct toward major expans benefit serv nation uniform budget directli assist veteran expand access highqual care approxim million veteran patient ensur care deliv time manner remark fund establish va center excel provid care special area prosthet vision spinal cord injuri age women health presid budget also reach veteran moder incom bring addit half million veteran va system maintain expand exist care lowincom disabl veteran time new budget enhanc servic relat mental health care broaden access treatment area throughout rural america america veteran earn servic best care offer va budget promis start recent tour illinoi remark opportun visit veteran past servic well meet young recruit train wear american uniform year ahead trip visit nd airlift wing illinoi air nation guard locat peoria il spoke mani fine airmen wing includ msg warren mccray master sergeant mccray air guardsman train joint termin attack control deploy armi troop ground ensur airpow employ enemi posit need courag young man recent return tour afghanistan award bronz star valor speak master sergeant mccray told multipl tour serv air guardsman mobil support oper endur freedom afghanistan deepli impress profession dedic servic countri even dedic fellow servic men women nd airlift wing consid mission abroad weigh cost term troop treasur duti also consid capac young men women serv us doesnt matter whether soldier sailor airman marin coast guard whether activ duti guard reserv must never forget person toll sacrific brave american effect made live futur spous children must ensur receiv superior access care return servic sacrific oblig honor veteran serv way serv us selflessli administr budget depart veteran affair recogn addit expand health benefit high qualiti care budget provid comprehens educ benefit particularli postl gi bill follow servic veteran access unpreced level educ support complet school week visit naval station great lake north chicago va medic center visit site learn plan naval health clinic great lake north chicago va medic center merg expand next coupl year merger extens costli also essenti sailor veteran illinoi mani spend much live facil north chicago va medic center met veteran age background heard stori hope need recruit train command met naval offic naval recruit given tour barrack lt ellen particularli impress lieuten chicago nativ serv ship offic uss arizona profession disciplin enthusiasm work qualiti share countless young servic men women across great countri tour thb facil lieuten saw face hundr young sailor train may one day serv countri import lt ellen young men women like receiv adequ care compens activ duti guard reserv importantli receiv care resourc deserv return serv countri nation moral oblig serv care brave individu work hard serv us,483,FALSE
1110017343,"Mr. President. this amendment is straightforward. There is an alleged significant violation of Federal law associated with the firm that was responsible for loblying for the insertion of these 13 earmarks. I have not said anything about the quality of these earmarks. I have not said anything about the individuals who actually placed them. What I ask my colleagues is. in light of where we are today. should we not back off and say these should be stricken from the bill at this time until that situation is clarified? It is prudent from a couple of standpoints. The investigation is rolling forward. We have had private residences now searched by the FBI. computers taken. and information pulled under subpoenas and search warrants issued by Federal courts. Do we want to be in the midst of passing things that were connected with what appears to be and is alleged to be improper behavior both in terms of the source of the funds. the payment of campaign funds. and the lobbying efforts on behalf of these firms? I cast no aspersion on the firms or the entities that are getting this. nor on the individuals who have placed these earmarks. But I can tell my colleagues the American people are not going to be happy if we dont recognize that maybe there is a checkpoint here where we ought to reconsider what we are doing in light of the developing situation around this firm. If we go forward and assume there will be prosecutions and convictions. we find ourselves in a very uncomfortable position of having encouraged it. We also send a signal to other individual lobbying firms that there isnt a standard of behavior to which we will not respond to their lobbying efforts. I ask my colleagues to take a look at this not as Members of the Senate but as individual citizens outside of the Senate in the country. as others look at us and say. What are you doing? Is there not a point in timeagain. I make the point that the Senator from Arizona made that it would be totally different if these were authorized earmarks. but they are not. They went through the Appropriations Committee. not the authorizing committees. They have never been judged by a group of our peers. They werent voted on. they were inserted. We raise the specter of whether we can be trustworthy in front of the American people. We need to work to regain their trust. I will not say any more. This will speak a lot about our body and what the American people say. I understand the votes are lining up. I understand that. But I will assure you that I will keep coming to the floor on earmarksnot because I am against earmarks. If you authorize an earmark. I will give you your right to do whatever you want to do. On unauthorized earmarks that arent vetted and are put out in front of the rest of the Congress and the rest of the individuals on committees to have a vote on whether they are a priority. I am going to keep raising that issue. I am sorry if that is irri.tating. but that is the way it is going to be. Mr. President. Senator BOXER defended an earmark she sponsored that I have singled out as an example of misplaced priorities. The Boxer earmark. which is one of nearly 9.000 tucked into this bill. is listed on page 100 of the bills report and is described only as $475.000 ""for improvements to the Orange County Great Park"" from the Economic Development Initiatives to ""Orange County Great Park Corporation. CA."" Nothing more is stated as to the purpose or intent of this earmark. Senator BOXER claimed that my criticism of this earmark was an insult to veterans in her state. This is apparently because the unwritten and unspecified intention of the earmark according to her statement is to restore the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station Hangar Number 244 into a history museum and welcoming center. The reality is this type of legislating without transparency is an insult to all taxpayers. With nearly 9.000 earmarks in this bill described with nothing more than a few words or a single vague phrase. it is next to impossible for anyone other than the Senators and lobbyists who requested these earmarks to know the real intent of how billions of dollars in taxpayer dollars are intended to be spent. As I found from statements made by the Senator from California and the Great Parks own Website. the Great Park ""will be larger than New Yorks Central Park and San Franciscos Golden Gate Park COMBINED."" This municipal park is expected to cost $1.1 billion. Its main attraction is a massive helium balloon operated by two pilots with sixfigure salaries. According to the Orange County Great Park Corporation Website. ""The Orange County Great Park Plan will provide a wide array of active and passive uses. including a 2.5 mile canyon and lake. miles of walking and biking trails. a cultural terrace. Orange Countys largest sports park. a botanical garden. and a tethered helium observation balloon that will be an icon for the Great Park. More than 3.885 of the 4.700 acres will be dedicated to -open space. education. and other public uses."" As found by the Los Angeles Times. the Great Park also includes a $300.000 tent designed to resemble an airplane hangar that costs $75.000 a year to clean. a fourperson visitor center crew hired under a $370.000 annual contract. a series of orange dots painted along the parks entrance road at a cost of $14.000. Additional costs have included $838.000 to build a road to the balloon. plant citrus trees and buy a $300.000 special 50by50foot tent that will serve as the visitor center. $380.000 a year for two balloon pilots. a hostess and maintenance. $100.000 a year for a balloon replacement fund. $94.000 a year for portable restrooms. $52.000 annually for security between 1 and 5 a.m.. and $30.000 a year for trash removal. This appropriation of almost half a million dollars could have gone to any of these initiatives none of which sound like true national priorities. Local county officials were. in fact. outraged with what local funds were being appropriated for. The bulk of the first $52 million the city spent on this project went to hire a team of dozens of design. engineering and public relations consultants. to build the balloon ride and to pay administrative staff. ""To have nothing more than a balloon and the possibility of a 27acre park is disappointing."" said county Supervisor Bill Campbel. "" Theyre spending a lot on engineers. PR people and other things. and theyre not delivering. "" State Assemblyman Todd Spitzera Republican from Orange Countryalso criticized the city for not building recreation facilities that could be used by the public. while wasting money on ""a ridiculous. oversized balloon and free rides."" With a statewide unemployment rate at over 10 percent and almost 2 million unemployed. Californians may also prefer these funds to be spent on other more pressing priorities. While we all want to honor the great sacrifices or our veterans. I do not believe this earmark is a national priority. especially in light of the poor local spending decisions made in the past on this ambitious municipal park project. Perhaps this money and the billions spent on the other pork projects in this bill could have been better spent on veterans health care or survivor benefits for the spouses and families of those who lost their lives fighting for our great Nation.",111117571,COBURN,THOMAS,S,OK,M,R,,voting,2009-03-04,164,Mr. COBURN,8809,9029,03042009.txt,7330,1274,111,2009,mr presid amend straightforward alleg signific violat feder law associ firm respons insert earmark said anyth qualiti earmark said anyth individu actual place ask colleagu light today back say stricken bill time situat clarifi prudent coupl standpoint investig roll forward privat resid search fbi comput taken inform pull subpoena search warrant issu feder court want midst pass thing connect appear alleg improp behavior term sourc fund payment campaign fund lobbi effort behalf firm cast aspers firm entiti get individu place earmark tell colleagu american peopl go happi dont recogn mayb checkpoint ought reconsid light develop situat around firm go forward assum prosecut convict find uncomfort posit encourag also send signal individu lobbi firm isnt standard behavior respond lobbi effort ask colleagu take look member senat individu citizen outsid senat countri other look us say point timeagain make point senat arizona made would total differ author earmark went appropri committe author committe never judg group peer werent vote insert rais specter whether trustworthi front american peopl need work regain trust say speak lot bodi american peopl say understand vote line understand assur keep come floor earmark author earmark give right whatev want unauthor earmark arent vet put front rest congress rest individu committe vote whether prioriti go keep rais issu sorri irrit way go mr presid senat boxer defend earmark sponsor singl exampl misplac prioriti boxer earmark one nearli tuck bill list page bill report describ improv orang counti great park econom develop initi orang counti great park corpor ca noth state purpos intent earmark senat boxer claim critic earmark insult veteran state appar unwritten unspecifi intent earmark accord statement restor el toro marin corp air station hangar number histori museum welcom center realiti type legisl without transpar insult taxpay nearli earmark bill describ noth word singl vagu phrase next imposs anyon senat lobbyist request earmark know real intent billion dollar taxpay dollar intend spent found statement made senat california great park websit great park larger new york central park san francisco golden gate park combin municip park expect cost billion main attract massiv helium balloon oper two pilot sixfigur salari accord orang counti great park corpor websit orang counti great park plan provid wide array activ passiv use includ mile canyon lake mile walk bike trail cultur terrac orang counti largest sport park botan garden tether helium observ balloon icon great park acr dedic open space educ public use found lo angel time great park also includ tent design resembl airplan hangar cost year clean fourperson visitor center crew hire annual contract seri orang dot paint along park entranc road cost addit cost includ build road balloon plant citru tree buy special byfoot tent serv visitor center year two balloon pilot hostess mainten year balloon replac fund year portabl restroom annual secur year trash remov appropri almost half million dollar could gone initi none sound like true nation prioriti local counti offici fact outrag local fund appropri bulk first million citi spent project went hire team dozen design engin public relat consult build balloon ride pay administr staff noth balloon possibl acr park disappoint said counti supervisor bill campbel theyr spend lot engin pr peopl thing theyr deliv state assemblyman todd republican orang critic citi build recreat facil could use public wast money ridicul overs balloon free ride statewid unemploy rate percent almost million unemploy californian may also prefer fund spent press prioriti want honor great sacrific veteran believ earmark nation prioriti especi light poor local spend decis made past ambiti municip park project perhap money billion spent pork project bill could better spent veteran health care survivor benefit spous famili lost live fight great nation,610,FALSE
1110039397,"Mr. President. in recent days. the White House. the news media. and many in this Chamber have taken the opportunity to reflect on the first 100 days of President Barack Qbamas administration. I rise today to offer my comments and evaluation in light of this milestone. Admittedly. it is somewhat arbitrary to use the 100day point in a Presidency as a time for evaluation. Indeed. success in the first 100 days doesnt guarantee success in the next 100 days or for the rest of a Presidential term. Likewise. struggles and failures in the first 100 days do not necessarily predicate similar troubles in the future. It is certainly the case that. as with most administrations. the defining moments of this current President are yet to be written. That said. President Obamas first 100 days have provided us with some unique insight into this President and how he intends to govern. It is this insight that informs my comments here today. The President came into office facing unprecedented expectations. While some of these 6xpectations may have been unfairly placed upon him by some. starryeyed supporters who -believed him to be a politician. a movie star. and a religious figure all in one. he brought much of the pressure upon himself. President Obama campaigned on a platform of big promises. not the least of which was a promise to change the tone here In Washington and move the country past the bitter partisan divides that has kept us polarized in recent years. But as any reasonable person observing U.S. politics will concede. we are not on that path yet. The supporters of the President will argue that he cannot accomplish such a daunting task alone and I tend to agree with them. However. so far. the President has done very little on his end to make good on that promise and that has been his biggest failing during the first 100 days. The problems began right out of the gate when the Congress debated the SCHIP reauthorization language. I was an original author of the SCHIP program and had been one of its strongest supporters. In fact. over the years. a number of Republicans in this Chamberincluding myself and Senator GRASSLEYhad endured a lot of criticism among our more conservative constituents over -our support for the SCHIP program. During the 110th Congress. we worked with the Democratic majority to forge a bipartisan compromise in order to ensure widespread support for reauthorizing this program. This included some commonsense proposals- to ensure the program was an efficient use of taxpayer funds. Yet. when the 111th Congress convened. the President and his supporters in Congress left that compromise on the side of the road and instead chose to push through a more expansive and liberal version of the bill. In the end. the bill passed on a vote divided on partisan lines. So. in the earliest days of his administration. the President was presented an easy opportunity to place unity and bipartisanship ahead of a farleft Democratic agenda and. unfortunately for the SCHIP program. he balked and. in doing so. he set the tone for the early months of his Presidency. Shortly thereafter. the President came to Congress with a proposed ""stimulus package"" at a pricetag of nearly a $1 trillion. Although it was eventually reduc6d to $790 billion. the ""stimulus package"" basically read like a wishlist of longtime Democratic policy priorities and had very little to do with actually stimulating the economy. For example. small businesses. which create 70 percent of the new jobs in this country. went virtually unnoticed in the Presidents ""stimulus"" bill. which focused more on expanding the Federal Goiernment and providing ""tax credits"" for millions of Americans who dont pay any taxes. The President had an opportunity to work with Republicans on the ""stimulus"" and include ideas that are proven to have immediate economic impactslike reducing the highest corporate tax rates in the industrialized world to keep businesses in the U.S. or tax credits to address the housing crisis. Instead. he chose to cut Republicans almost entirely out of the negotiations and was content to have the support of only three members of the minority voting in favor. one of whom officially joined the majority earlier this week. Almost as disappointing as the substance of the bill was the Presidents tactics in debating the ""stimulus."" Rather than acknowledging sincere policy differences between Democrats and Republicans. he accused the Republicans .of wanting to do nothing. which was anything but the truth. This too has become an unfortunate. yet commonly used. tactic used by the Obama administration. The partisan recklessness continued into the debate over the Presidents budget. I have been in the Senate now for33 years and I can say without reservation that President Obamas first budget is the most poorly crafted budget I have ever seen. In 1 year. the Presi11ents budget will quadruple the Federal deficitThat. is the case even if you use the Presidents own estimates. Following the Presidents budget will create more debt than was created under every President from George. Washington through George W. Bush combined. It also contains the largest tax increase in history of our union: And. under the Obama budget. government spending could end up as high as 40 percent of the GDP within the space of only a few years. In order to assuage such concernsor at least in order to pretend to do sothe President has claimed that his budget will cut the deficit in half over 5 years. So. he will quadruple the deficit in 1 yearbut we dont have worry because. 5 years from now. he will cut that deficit in half? Does anyone really think the President was considering his promises of bipartisanship when drafting this budget? It is not only the size of the budget. but its priorities. Like the stimulus bill. the Presidents budget reads like a policy manifesto for farleft Democrats. Worse still. the President and congressional majority have declared their intentions to use the budget reconciliation process in order to enact major pillars of their domestic policy platform. including an expansive governmentrun health care program and an energy tax euphemistically referred to as ""cap and trade."" These are bills the President couldnt get passed through regular order. even with the large Democratic majorities. So. instead. he seems willing and able to force them through with little substantive debate. leaving the minority completely out of the equation. Once again. it appears that the Presidents promise of increased bipartisanship came with an expiration date. I wish this was all. but unfortunately it is no t. The Presidents failure to live up to his promises of bipartisanship extends into the national security sphere. One of his very first -actions as President was to order the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison facility. -Of course. he didnt have an alternative plan in place. only the stated desire to close the prison and to cast aspersions on his predecessors efforts to protect our countrys national security. Such inane details--like what we will do with these dangerous captives once the facility closes--could wait until later. the President had a political statement to make. Just 2 weeks ago. President Obama opted to selectively declassify memos drafted by the Office of Legal Counsel during the Bush administration relating to CIA interrogation tactics.. Instead of providing the American people real context about these tactics--their successes and failuresthe President opted to placate those on the far left who want nothing less than an indictment and trial of our former President. He did this for the stated purpose of clearing the air and moving forward. yet he left open the possibility of prosecuting former Bush officials whose only alleged crimes were to offer legal opinions. One would think that a.President who is truly interested in bipartisanship and moving forward would avoid further politicizing such contentious issues. Yet. as a result of the Presidents lack of leadership. we may be looking at months and years of show trials in order to pacify those on the far left who would criminalize policy differences in order to exact political vengeance on the Bush administration. I hope that this will not be the case and that the President will change course on these issues. Now. to be fair. the President has made some good decisions during his first 100 days and I am not unwilling to give him credit where it is due. For example. he ended the ban on Federal funding for embryonic stem cell research. I have supported taking such measures for many years as I believe that this research has the potential to revolutionize medicine in this country. This was. in my view. a wise decision on the part of the President and I have commended him for it. Likewise. the President exercised true leadership in helping Congress to pass the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act. a new law that will revolutionize volunteer service in this country. This bill was a longtime coming and had the support of a bipartisan coalition here in the Senate. Beginning with his address before Congress in February. President Obama got involved in helping this legislation move forward"" and. as a result. many people throughout the country will be given more opportunity to serve in their neighborhoods and to do much of the heavy lifting in fixing our Nations problems. I have both publicly and privately thanked the President for his support of the Serve America Act. Sadly. such instances of true bipartisanship have been few and far between. Some may believe I am being too hard on the President or that my concerns are just sour grapes over my own partisan disagreements with the Presidents agenda. But. from the day he was inaugurated. I have continually expressed my willingness to work with President Obama. After all. this is my country too and I want him to succeed. My record in being willing and able to work with Members of both parties speaks foritself. But. in my opinion. success in addressing the major issues facing our countryincluding health care. energy. and our crippling entitlement programs--will require the work May 12. 2009 - co: and ideas of both parties. So far. with very few exceptions. the President .seems all too willing to keep his own counsel and that of his fellow Democrats on how to address these issues. This is no!the type of government he promised on the campaign trail and. quite frankly. I think it has led to policy results that. at best. have to be considered questionable. Going forward. I hope that. instead of cursory gestures and empty statements encouraging bipartisanship. President Obama makes a real effort to listen to and accept ideas from both sides of the aisle.. That will take real courage and leadership and. thus far. I dont know that he has demonstrated much of either.",111118171,HATCH,ORRIN,S,UT,M,R,,voting,2009-05-12,154,Mr. HATCH,6012,6334,05122009.txt,10875,1810,111,2009,mr presid recent day white hous news

1110057746,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself 3 minutes. Mr. Chairman. let me point out that the underlying language in this bill is. in fact. a compromise. It lifts the ban. but it does not permit Federal funds to be used for needle exchange programs that occur within 1.000 feet of a day care center. school. college or university. any public swimming pool. park. playground. video arcade. or youth center or any events sponsored by any such entity. There is overwhelming evidence that syringe exchange programs when implemented as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy are an effective public health intervention for reducing HIV/AIDS and hepatitis and do not promote drug use. Now let me be clear. I detest illegal drug use. I think it constitutes a national security threat. It ruins lives. It causes crime. It gets us into wars against drugs in Colombia and Mexico. and in fact. it gets us into another war in Afghanistan because of poppy production. So I hate illegal drugs. But even more. I hate the spread of AIDS. Theres overwhelming evidence that we can help stop the spread of AIDS by allowing needle exchange programs. They are endorsed by leading public health organizations. such as the Institute of Medicine. the World Health Organization. the American Academy of Pediatrics. the American Medical Association. the American Nurses Association. the American Public Health Association. They are endorsed by people such as Dr. Anthony Fauci. the Nations leading fighter against AIDS. Thomas Frieden. former NIH Director Harold Varmus. former Surgeons General C. Everett Koop and David Satcher. who served under Republican and Democratic administrations. They are endorsed by people such as Captain Andrew Smith from the Los Angeles Police Department. Atlantic City Deputy Chief of Police Robert Schwartz. and San Francisco Chief of Police Frederick Lau. Let me make one other point. Every Member of Congress has access to decent primary health care. but we are going to put at risk a substantial number of people if we do not support this underlying committee amendment. I want to say something personal. If we lose this amendment. it is not going to be because a lot of people on this House floor really believe that this ban makes sense. It will be because many Members are concerned and fear a cheapshot political 30second ad that distorts their position. spreads halftruths and scares people.

1110044537,Madam President. there are more than 1.8 million family members of active duty servicemembers and an additional 1.1 million family members of reserve component members. Every one of these families makes sacrifices each and every day along with their servicemember and plays a very significant role in serving our country. Military families often face unique challenges and difficulties throughout their loved ones career. including frequent relocations to bases across the country and overseas as well as the various demands stemming from continued deployments of members from every service. The Nation must ensure that all the needs of military dependent children and spouses are being met. The life of a military family member has never been an easy one. but in our 8th year of war. families are facing even more hardships. Deployments are an undeniable strain on families. While a servicemember is away. spouses are often forced into the role of a single parentjuggling employment. child care. and household duties each and every day. all the while living with the pressure of having a family member deployed to a combat zone. Families are an integral part of the force. and stress on the force affects overall readiness. Servicemembers will experience less stress in the field if they are assured their families are well taken care of back home. And it is imperative that families remain as resilient as possible in order to provide a stable environment for loved ones when they return home from those deployments. Families are often the first line of defense against posttraumatic stress and suicide. but may be experiencing similar feelings themselves. We must ensure that families and servicemembers have timely access to mental health resources and programs. We must make every dependent aware of the resources available to them to assist in everything from finances to job placement to health care and counseling. Thousands of military family members have taken it upon themselves to confront these challenges by volunteering to -provide critical assistance during deployments to servicemembers. their spouses. and children. as well as giving vital support to families relocating to a new area. And sadly. many families have made the ultimate sacrifice in the loss of a servicemember who proudly defended our Nation. We in Congress have tried to do our. part to help. and have made family support programs and initiatives a priority. In recent bills we have called for: the establishment of a Department of Defense Military Family Readiness Council. education. training. and tuition assistance to help spouses maintain careers. respite care for parents caring for children on.their own due to deployments. authorized increased levels of Impact Aid for military dependents education. and established and supported the nationwide expansion of the Departments Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program which is aimed at helping members and families of the Guard and Reserve. But there is still more to do. With President and Mrs. Obama placing the support of our military families among their top priorities. we must take this opportunity to renew our commitment and express our deepest appreciation to military family members who bravely serve this Nation alongside their servicemembers. It is my hope that this Year of the Military Family inspires us. the Department of Defense. the military Services. and Americans everywhere to commit to helping military families and servicemembers in any way we can. and to ensure that these strong men. women. and children are given the recognition. appreciation. and support that they so truly deserve.,111117441,LEVIN,CARL,S,MI,M,D,,voting,2009-06-02,149,Mr. LEVIN,18173,18276,06022009.txt,3643,574,111,2009,madam presid million famili member activ duti servicememb addit million famili member reserv compon member everi one famili make sacrific everi day along servicememb play signific role serv countri militari famili often face uniqu challeng difficulti throughout love one career includ frequent reloc base across countri oversea well variou demand stem continu deploy member everi servic nation must ensur need militari depend children spous met life militari famili member never easi one th year war famili face even hardship deploy undeni strain famili servicememb away spous often forc role singl employ child care household duti everi day live pressur famili member deploy combat zone famili integr part forc stress forc affect overal readi servicememb experi less stress field assur famili well taken care back home imper famili remain resili possibl order provid stabl environ love one return home deploy famili often first line defens posttraumat stress suicid may experienc similar feel must ensur famili servicememb time access mental health resourc program must make everi depend awar resourc avail assist everyth financ job placement health care counsel thousand militari famili member taken upon confront challeng volunt provid critic assist deploy servicememb spous children well give vital support famili reloc new area sadli mani famili made ultim sacrific loss servicememb proudli defend nation congress tri part help made famili support program initi prioriti recent bill call establish depart defens militari famili readi council educ train tuition assist help spous maintain career respit care parent care children ontheir due deploy author increas level impact aid militari depend educ establish support nationwid expans depart yellow ribbon reintegr program aim help member famili guard reserv still presid mr obama place support militari famili among top prioriti must take opportun renew commit express deepest appreci militari famili member brave serv nation alongsid servicememb hope year militari famili inspir us depart defens militari servic american everywher commit help militari famili servicememb way ensur strong men women children given recognit appreci support truli deserv,327,FALSE
1110013939,"On Saturday. February 7. The Washington Post reported that a Turkish Islamicoriented human rights group. the Association of Human Rights and Solidarity for Oppressed Peoples. known as MazlumDer. initiated a probe to investigate if war crimes and genocide were committed by Israel during the recent Gaza conflict. I was startled to read that MazlumDer plans to investigate 19 Israelis. including Prime Minister Olmert. President Peres. Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni. and Defense Minister Ehud Barak. for orchestrating genocide. For a Nation that for 94 years has practiced widespread genocide denial of the killing of 1.5 million Armenians. hypocrisy runs deep today in Ankara. Last week. I expressed my concerns regarding Turkeys recent rash of antiSemitism. but this probe is going too far. Israel did not commit genocide. but this has not stopped Ankaras chief prosecutor from launching this war crimes probe. The probe out of Turkey will investigate Israels actions in the Gaza conflict to see if they amount to ""genocide. torture and crimes against humanity."" If the prosecutor finds evidence against the Israeli leaders. under Turkish law. they can be detained if they enter Turkey. The absurdity of this probe and of the fact that Turkey is issuing that it must be exposed. Israel did not commit genocide. Israel was not attempting to eliminate the Palestinian people. Israel was protecting itself from the hundreds of bombs Hamas has been shooting into its cities. MazlumDer has no ground to stand on. and Turkey has no ground to stand on. Neither this NGO nor the Turkish Government has ever attempted to discuss the truth of the Armenian genocide. nor has Turkey or MazlumDer taken action against the present genocide that continues to rage in Darfur. While Israelis are defending themselves against constant attacks from Hamas. MazlumDer insists this is genocide. How can this organization accuse Israel of committing genocide when it has yet to categorize the thousands of killings in Darfur as genocide? The Turkish people need to step back and question their skewed understanding of genocide. Look in the mirror. Look at your own history. Come to terms with the fact that 1.5 million Armenians died and that. when contemporary genocides. like Darfur. take place. they should be denounced. Instead of denouncing it. Turkeys relationship with Sudan is strong. Last year. Turkish President Abdullah Gul warmly welcomed Sudanese President Omar alBashir to Ankara. Yet alBashir continues to preside over a genocidal regime responsible for the deaths of 300.000 Sudanese people in the Darfur region of the country. Today. 2.7 million Darfuris have lost their homes since the conflict and now live in internally displaced persons camps. While all of this happens. President Gul of Turkey has said that the situation in Darfur adds up to a ""humanitarian tragedy"" caused by economic difficulties. Now. this watering down of statesponsored government killing is an affront to the thousands who have perished in Darfur. Yet a Turkish organization is investigating genocide in Israel? What hypocrisy. President Gul greeted the Sudanese leader with a military guaid of honor only bestowed on Turkeys closest allies. While the international community fiercely works to contain alBashirs government. Turkey embraces it. Both governments have a long history of genocide denial. Mr. Speaker. the Republic of Turkey has had 94 years to recognize the Armenian genocide perpetrated on their soil in 1915. Like the Sudanese Government. the Turkish Governments statesponsored ethnic cleansing of the Armenians in the early 20th century left 1.5 million Armenians tortured. murdered and displaced. Yet. to this day. the Republic of Turkey continues to deny the slaughter of the Armeniansinstead. launching an absurd investigatibn into Israel. If Turkey and its NGOs want to take a stand against genocide. they should not be pointing at Israel. nor should Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan be threatening Israel with comments like these: ""Allah will sooner or later punish those who transgress the rights of innocents."" Well. if Turkey wants to move closer to the West. it should practice some selfreflection on its own history regarding the Armenian genocide and help to end the genocide in Darfur. fl 1515",111120730,PALLONE,FRANK,H,NJ,M,D,6,voting,2009-02-13,397,Mr. PALLONE,17247,17384,02132009.txt,4292,678,111,2009,saturday februari washington post report turkish human right group associ human right solidar oppress peopl known initi probe investig war crime genocid commit israel recent gaza conflict startl read plan investig isra includ prime minist olmert presid pere foreign minist defens minist ehud barak orchestr genocid nation year practic widespread genocid denial kill million armenian hypocrisi run deep today ankara last week express concern regard turkey recent rash antisemit probe go far israel commit genocid stop ankara chief prosecutor launch war crime probe probe turkey investig israel action gaza conflict see amount genocid tortur crime human prosecutor find evid isra leader turkish law detain enter turkey absurd probe fact turkey issu must expos israel commit genocid israel attempt elimin palestinian peopl israel protect hundr bomb hama shoot citi ground stand turkey ground stand neither ngo turkish govern ever attempt discuss truth armenian genocid turkey taken action present genocid continu rage darfur isra defend constant attack hama insist genocid organ accus israel commit genocid yet categor thousand kill darfur genocid turkish peopl need step back question skew understand genocid look mirror look histori come term fact million armenian die contemporari genocid like darfur take place denounc instead denounc turkey relationship sudan strong last year turkish presid abdullah gul warmli welcom sudanes presid omar albashir ankara yet albashir continu presid genocid regim respons death sudanes peopl darfur region countri today million darfuri lost home sinc conflict live intern displac person camp happen presid gul turkey said situat darfur add humanitarian tragedi caus econom difficulti water statesponsor govern kill affront thousand perish darfur yet turkish organ investig genocid israel hypocrisi presid gul greet sudanes leader militari honor bestow turkey closest alli intern commun fierc work contain albashir govern turkey embrac govern long histori genocid denial mr speaker republ turkey year recogn armenian genocid perpetr soil like sudanes govern turkish govern statesponsor ethnic cleans armenian earli th centuri left million armenian tortur murder displac yet day republ turkey continu deni slaughter launch absurd israel turkey ngo want take stand genocid point israel turkish prime minist erdogan threaten israel comment like allah sooner later punish transgress right innoc well turkey want move closer west practic selfreflect histori regard armenian genocid help end genocid darfur fl,381,FALSE

I can tell my colleagues and those who are following this debate. this bill is critically important to our financial institutions. They have been waiting weeks for this bill that Senator SHELBY and I put together. I am not. in any way. suggesting the amendments being offered are not motivated by the best of intentions. but the net effect of it is to virtually bring down this bill. I say to my colleagues. I know they are hearing from others across the country who have been waiting for this bill to come up. to be considered. and moved along. There is no way we can spend the amount of days now that may be confronting us with the list of amendments to go forward. The leadershipand I agree with them on thisneeds some clarity. If*I am going to be faced with a stack of amendments being offered. then I am going to have to. as the leadership said. take this bill down and maybe in the fall at some future date get back to it. if at all. That is a tragedy and unfortunate.because it is an important matter. It is widely supported across the country. It is essential in many ways we get it done. I wish for my colleagues to know it is not aimed at any particular amendment. It is not suggested their amendments are not well motivated. But when you load up a bill such as this with that many amendments. it makes it impossible to get the job done. I objected to laying aside the pending amendment because we have several amendments now pending. We will try. over the coming day or so. to see if we can resolve some of those amendments. maybe accept some. I have to speak with. of course. my colleague from Alabama. Senator SHELBY. to see if there iS agreement on some of the matters or some modification to make them acceptable. I suggest to my colleagues. any additional people coming over to temporarily lay aside the pending amendments. that I will object to doing that until we get clarity and try to clear out the underbrush to determine whether we bring down the bill. which I will do. or to get a reasonable number of these amendments which we can handle to go forward. One or the other. For those who are following this debate. the possibility of this bill being taken down is very real.

1110067252,Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Minnesota. I want to add my comments to that of the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from Delaware to commend the new Senator from Massachusetts. He not only carries on the great work of Ted Kennedy. but he does it with the same passion and eloquence. What struck me in this legislationand reminiscent of Senator Kennedyis that this legislation will provide real help to real people. It is about solutions. not slogans. Let me illuminate. if I may. Premium relief. What is troubling so many middleclass families? They are too wealthy to qualify for direct public assistance in terms of the Medicaid Program. but they are not wealthy enough to pay for insurance. This legislation will cap family outlays on medical insurance premiums. Families making under $88.000 will pay no more than 10 percent of their income on premiums. They will be given direct assistance through the tax system. There will be a rebate. So people now. rather than staring at 20 percent. 15 percent. 18 percent increases. will at least know there is a cap. And perhaps if we do our work well enough. the whole system will begin to reduce below the 10percent mark. and everyone will benefit. It is also notable that real families worry about many things. They worry about educating their children. They want them to be educated. but they also recognize as fulltime students in higher education. they can stay on the family health care plan. It is interesting to note that decisions made about education are tied into health care. and also. in fact. as to where you work. if you should keep your job you do not like because you have health care or go on. whether you strike out to start a new business because you have this brilliant idea or stay in your current position because there is health care there. But what this bill does. again. is provide real help for real people and allows families to keep their children on their health care plan until they are 26 years old. It also reforms dramatically the insurance system. Again. we listen to many of the complaints: Oh. we dont want a governmentrun health care system. we dont want bureaucrats telling us what to do. The irony. of course. as you mentioned. and Senator SCHUMER did. too. is that one of the most popular health care programs in this country is Medicare. which is government run. One of the other most popular health care programs in this country is run through the Veterans Administration. which is a government agency. The least popular programs are private health insurance. where everyone has complaintsdoctors. patients. providers. This legislation will prevent lifetime limits that insurance companies dictate. It will also do many other things. So let me conclude because I appreciate very muchand if the time allows. I have a question for the Senator from Massachusetts. But this is a bill that when you move past all of the rhetorical smokescreens- because. frankly. most of our colleagues on the other side dont want to do anything. They didnt want to do it in 1993 and 1994. they didnt want to do it in 1933 and 1935. and they still dont want to do itthis legislation helps real people with solutions not slogans about nationalization and bureaucrats.,111118381,REED,JOHN,S,RI,M,D,,voting,2009-11-21,183,Mr. REED,10386,10493,11212009.txt,3246,560,111,2009,mr presid thank senat minnesota want add comment senat maryland senat delawar commend new senat massachusett carri great work ted kennedi passion eloqu struck legislationand reminisc senat kennedyi legisl provid real help real peopl solut slogan let illumin may premium relief troubl mani middleclass famili wealthi qualifi direct public assist term medicaid program wealthi enough pay insur legisl cap famili outlay medic insur premium famili make pay percent incom premium given direct assist tax system rebat peopl rather stare percent percent percent increas least know cap perhap work well enough whole system begin reduc percent mark everyon benefit also notabl real famili worri mani thing worri educ children want educ also recogn fulltim student higher educ stay famili health care plan interest note decis made educ tie health care also fact work keep job like health care go whether strike start new busi brilliant idea stay current posit health care bill provid real help real peopl allow famili keep children health care plan year old also reform dramat insur system listen mani complaint oh dont want governmentrun health care system dont want bureaucrat tell us ironi cours mention senat schumer one popular health care program countri medicar govern run one popular health care program countri run veteran administr govern agenc least popular program privat health insur everyon patient provid legisl prevent lifetim limit insur compani dictat also mani thing let conclud appreci muchand time allow question senat massachusett bill move past rhetor smokescreen frankli colleagu side dont want anyth didnt want didnt want still dont want itthi legisl help real peopl solut slogan nation bureaucrat,266,FALSE
1110034218,Mr. President. I rise in support of the nomination of Gov. Kathleen Sebelius to be Secretary of HHS. I do so enthusiastically. I do so as a personal friend of Kathleens. I do so as a fellow public servant who has observed her considerable public service to her State of Kansas and to the people of this country. A dozen years agoa little more. it was actually about 14 years agoshe was elected. unusually. as a Democrat in Republican Kansas. to a statewide office known as insurance commissioner. It is a littleknown and thankless job but one that has traditionally been under the thumb of the insurance industry. She came out of the Kansas Legislature. so she had a good schooling in the art of political craft. Indeed. that started long. before she ever entered the Kansas Legislature because her dad was the Governor of Ohio. So it is in her genes. Her fatherinlaw was the longtime Republican Congressman from Kansas. In that very Republican State. they elected a Democrat as the insurance commissioner. It was not a close election. but it was one in which. once she was installed as insurance commissioner. she started showing people who was boss. The elected representative of the people of Kansas was going to administer the laws with regard to the protection of consumers. which is the purpose of having an insurance advocate for the people. Only a few States continue to elect their insurance commissioner. It is known as the office of the revolving door since most of the insurance commissioners are appointed. The revolving door starts with the insurance industry having a representative who is appointed by the appointing authority. usually the Governor. because someone who is knowledgable about insurance has to be insurance commissioner. But. indeed. the door continues to revolve. and the average time of service for an appointed insurance commissioner is less than 1 year. As a result. as you watch the door revolve. they come in from the insurance industry. become the top regulator of the insurance. industry. and on the average. in less than a year. the door revolves and they are out the door and they are back in the very industry from whence they came. That is not the smartest way to have an insurance regulator. Kathleen Sebelius defied that model. As the elected insurance commissioner of Kansas. she stood up for consumer rights and she cracked the whip to get the insurance companies to offer this product that has now become a necessity. not a luxury. Why? You cant drive a car without insurance. You cant own a home. if you have a mortgage. without insurance. You better have some life insurance if you are planning for your family. By the way. we have not even talked about health iilsurance. A huge percentage. well over a majority of the people in this country. get their health insurance through their employer. As we approach the issue of health care reform. what to do about insurance is going to be front and center. and Governor Sebelius is uniquely qualified to address this issue. We have 47 million people in this country who do not have health insurance. but they get health care. Where do they get health care? They get it from the most expensive place. which is the emergency room. and they get it at the most expensive time. which is when their symptoms have turned into a full. raging emergency. Therefore. because they did not have health insurance. they were not seeing a doctor for preventive care. and all of this additional cost. plus the additional costs of being treated in an emergency roomguess who pays. All of us pick up that tab. That. additionally. is plowed back into the costs we pay for health care. in large part through the insurance premiums we pay. Governor Sebelius is someone who has been there. she has done that. She knows how this insurance system operates. She knows the parameters in which you have to offer health insurance to people in order to make it work. She understands the financing behind it. She is uniquely qualified for this position of Secretary of HHS. Since I have the privilege of being a personal friend. I have known her over these 14 years in our capacities as elected insurance commissioners. she from Kansas and me -from Florida. and then as I have continVed to see her in her public service. then having gone from insurance commissioner to Governor. she comes at a time when this Nation is begging for health care reform. The President has chosen Kathleen in this exceptionally important position to not only use her skills as a former regulator where she can crack the whip but to use her skills as a person who can bring people together. who can reconcile. who can build consensuswhich she has honed over the years and I suspect honed those skills at the knee of her father as she was growing up. She honed those skills as a public servantas a legislator. as an elected statewide official. as the Governor. and now she will be the right person at the right time whom this Nation needsa very good Secretary of Health and Human Services.

1110019487,"Mr. President. I wish to speak once again about my amendment dealing with the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program we have here in the District of Columbia. Currently. 1.700 children from lower income families are able to attend a private school with a $7.500 voucher thanks to this program. a program we Implemented about 5 years ago. It seems the No. 1 priority for the National Education Association. one of the largest unions in the country. is to eliminate this program. We are talking about real children here. These are two of the kids who attend school with President Obamas children. It is a great school. The President and Mrs. Obama could afford to send their kids to any school. They chose this particular school because it is an excellent school. They chose not to send them to a public school in Washington. DC. After seeing some of the statistics on the DC public schools. it doesnt surprise me. Why should these two happy. healthy ljds who are enrolled at the same school as the Presidents children be forced to leave? The bill before us allows the program to continue for one more year. then. if not reauthorized and approved by the DC City Council. the bill defunds the program and forces 1.700 children out of private schools where they are happy. healthy and learning. I quoted these statistics earlier: fortyfive percent of Senators and 37 percent of members bf the House send their children to private schools. That is almost four times the rate of the general population. Quality education shouldnt be only for a privileged few. We should be able to send kids such as Sarah and James here to the schools where they can get a better education. where they are safer. The safety of DC public schools is a major concern. Onehalf of all teenagers attending DC public schools are in a school that has enough criminal activity to be classified as persistently dangerous. In school year 20062007. DC Metropolitan Police reported that over 6.500 crimes were committed in D.C. public schools. Too many of these schools are not safe. It is a civil right to get a good education. So we came up with a plan a few years ago that took up to 2.000 poor children in the metro DC area and sent them to a school of their parents choice. Washington. DC. spends more than any school District in America per student. The District of Columbia spends over $15.000 per student per yearthree times as much as we spend in my home State of Nevada. Yet the public schools are failing here in Washington. So we decided.-to design a program to see if we can help some of those kids escape the failing public schools in Washington. We thought: if it works as a pilot project. maybe we can expand it to other places. Well. the National Education Association has come out with their No. 1 priority. which is to destroy this program. My question is. Why? I believe they are afraid this program is working. so it is a threat to their power. It is a threat to union member dues. That is unfortunate because when it comes to education. our only concern should be in the quality of education for our children. They need that kind of quality education to compete in the 21st century. - I have a couple other kids to tell my colleagues about. This is Sanya. She is a beautiful. happy young lady. and is receiving a great education in a private school here in DC. Today. she has a 3.95 GPA. She is the vice president of her class. She is the captain of her soccer team. a player on the lacrosse team. president of the International Club. and she is a peer minister. She is a future leader whom we are going to be taking out of the school she loves if this bill is enacted without my amendment. Rashawn is 16 years old and a handsome devil. He started school in 1996. His father had him tested and found out he was 3 years behind his grade level. The scholarship program provided him the opportunity to go to the Academia De La Recta Christian Day School. Rashawn said he can now do his classwork with very little help because of the scholarship. His sister. Dominique. who is 14 years of age. is now attending the same school. and these are her words. She says: ""I love my school now. I am working on my level on my grade."" Do we really want to take these kids out of their schools? Do we really want to do that? We have to ask ourselves. Do we want to protect this bill and the special interests this bill is addressing so much that we are actually going to pull 1.700 children from lower income families out of the schools they are attending today? I think it is unconscionable that we are going to be doing that. Breanna Williams is 9 years of age and in the fourth grade. She loves her new school. St. Peters. She is getting all As and Bs. She loves to read and is reading at a level above her grade. In addition. Breanna plays clarinet in the school band. When she grows up. she wants to be a translator and travel the world. Lastly. I wish to tell my colleagues about Ronald Holassie. He is currently Washington. DCs deputy youth mayor. I had the honor of meeting this young man. and I had the honor of meeting his little brother. Richard. His little brother. Richard. 8 years of age. came to our press conference and stole the show. These are two incredibly bright young men. Ronald. a tenth grader. runs track. he is studying physics. mentoring middleschool students. and absolutely loves every minute of it. As the Youth Deputy Mayor. he considers saving this program his chief legislative priority. because he has seen what it has done for him and what it has done for his little brother. So individually and collectively these programs are working. We just have to put ourselves in a commonsense position. There have been some -studies quoted here claiming that this program wasnt working. First of all. the studies were incredibly flawed. We pointed out all of the flaws of the study. But we just have to ask ourselves. if 45% of the Senators send their kids to private schools. and they pay a lot of money to do that. would they do that if they thought the educational opportunity was inferior? Of course not. It just makes common sense. Do you think the parents of these 1.700 children would voluntarily send their kids to the DC schools of their choice if these schools were inferior or if their kids werent getting a better education? Well. of course not. This is what President Obamas Education Secretary said about the DC scholarship program. He said: It is a mistake to take kids out of a school where theyre happy and safe and satisfied. I think those kids need to stay in their school. So we need to adopt my amendment to keep the DC scholarship program funded. It is the right thing to do for these kids. Showing them we care more about their education than we do some special interest group is the right thing to do. So I urge all of my colleagues. when they are voting. to think of Ronald. Think of the kids we have talked about and many others. Instead of doing away with this program. lets study it. Lets study what7is working about it. If it is working. lets expand it to other places in the country. America leads the world when it comes to higher education. Our colleges and universities are the best. One of the reasons they are the best is because you can take a GI bill. student loan or Pell grant. and you have the opportunity to attend any college you desire. You have a choice. About 5 years ago. this program gave these kids a choice. Our public. K12 school system is in bad shape when compared to the rest of the industrialized world. We are falling behind. especially in science. math and in the technical fields. If we want our kids to have the chance to compete in the 21st century. we have to improve our school system. One of the ways to do that is through competition. This is just a little experiment and a little competition that some people now want to come to this floor and destroy. So lets think of these kids. and lets think of kids all over America when we are thinking about the educational choices we are going to be making in the Senate. Lets give children in DC a choice. We. as senators. are fortunate enough to have a choice for our children. Fortyfive percent of the Senators chose private schools. including the chief opponent of this amendment. Senator DURBIN.

1110069163,Mr. President. the American people have now seen what Democrats in Congress plan to do with seniors health care. They have looked on in total disbelief as the majority voted again and again to slash Medicare by nearly $1/2 trillion. Incredibly. these cuts represent just part of the pain caused by this bill. In addition to punishing seniors. it would punish businesses. At a time when 1 out of 10 working Americans is looking for a job. this bill would hit employers with jobkilling new taxes and mandates. and it wouldnt do anything to lower longterm health care costs. This is the very last thing business owners expected from this bill. It is the last thing America needs in the midst of a recession. And it is just one of the reasons more and more business groups are stepping forward and speaking out against this jobkilling bill. Yesterday. I mentioned a letter signed by 10 major trade groups pleading with us not to approve this bill because of the effect it would have on business. Later in the day. the National Federation of Independent Business. one of the leaders in the small business community. released a letter explaining why they opposed the bill. They said any health care reform faces two tests for small businesses: Does it lower insurance costs. and will it increase the overall cost of doing business. According to them. the Senate bill fails both of these tests and therefore fails small business. They have seen the CBO conclude that this bill would lead to higher premiums. They have seen the billions of new taxes that would fall unfairly on small businesses. And they have seen the mandates and the fines that would kill jobs. They have concluded that this bill would actually be worse for small business than the current situation. It is abundantly clear that the more Americans learn about this bill. the more they oppose it. Now we know the same goes for business. Businesses that cant insure workers face stiff fines resulting in lost wages and jobs. according to the independent Congressional Budget Office. What is more. studies suggest that this socalled employer mandate would have a disproportionate impact on lowincome. entrylevel workers. At a time of 10 percent unemployment. we should be doing everything we can to create jobs. This bill would only lead to more lost jobs. Medicare cuts are bad enough. but this bill doesnt just hurt seniors. it hurts the economy as well. That is why Americans overwhelmingly oppose it. Speaking of how people feel about this bill. we see signs of opposition everywhere. Public opinion is overwhelming. In all the polls across the country. the American people are saying: Dont pass this bill. Last months gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia were a stinging rebuke to the Democratic approach of more spending. more debt. higher taxes. and endless bureaucracy. There is a new development. Just yesterdayjust yesterday in my home Statethere was a special election for the State senate. Why would that be worthy of commentary on the Senate floor? Let me describe the situation. It is a 3to1 Democratic district. Because of State issues. the Democratic State administration was intensely interested in winning that seat. They spent $1 million cumulativelythe candidate. the Democratic State party. and an outside interest groupin support of the Democrat-$1 million on one side of a State senate race in a rural area of my State. On the other side was a Republican candidate. who was outspent 5 to 1outspent 5 to 1 in a 3to1 Democratic district. The Republican candidate for the State senate won by 12 points. How did that happen? He had one messageone message: oppose the Reid bill. oppose what PELOSI is doing. oppose what the Democrats in Washington are doing. In other words. the candidate who was outspent 5 to 1 in a district where he was outregistered 3 to 1 made the sole issue in the State senate race what is happening here in Washington on this bill that is on this floor. That ought to tell you on the heels of the Virginia and New Jersey elections what is happening in this country. People have seen enough and heard enough. and they want it to stop. The message is simple. This health care bill is a losing formula all around. That is the message Americans are sending loudly and clearly. The signs are everywhere. We saw it yesterday in my home State. It is time to stop this bill and start over. Mr. President.

1110062701,Mr. President. I rise with respect to Irans nuclear program. I commend the Senator from Connecticut. chairman of the Banking Committee. for his presentation a few moments ago. Similar to so many Americans. we have learned a lot in the last couple days that is troubling. The Iranian regime. discredited this summer by the deplorable repression of peaceful prodemocracy demonstrators across the country. has reached a new low on the international stage. Again. I speak of the Iranian regimethe Governmentand not the people of Iran. The disclosure of the uranium enrichment facility near the city of Qum should serve as a wakeup call for those who believed Irans nuclear program was only for peaceful purposes. The regime continues to deceive the international community about its nuclear intentions and program development. It continues to threaten our ally Israel. it continues to disregard its international commitments. and. yes. the regime continues to directly threaten the national security interests of the United States. As the administration begins talks on Thursday. we in the Senate should be prepared to do our part and pass tougher sanctions on the Iranian regime to compel its compliance with international standards. We have a responsibility to provide the administration with the tools it needs to maximize pressure on this increasingly intransigent Iranian regime. I applaud the administrations approach to recalibrating U.S. engagement around the world. At a minimum. this international effort will restore Americas longheld reputation of being an honest broker. of a country that values diplomacy and relationships with allies and welcomes new ones. Internationally. the United States is on a better footing than it has been in years. Ties with allies have been strengthened. Those on the fence. such as Russia and China. in this particular question. are showing signs of cooperation on issues that are critical to our national interests. Our adversaries. not sure how to demonize the United States such as they used to do. are on their heels. The administrations diplomatic offensive has put us into a position where we have a strong coalition going into these important discussions on Thursday. The events of the last week are unfortunate evidence of the Iranian regimes deceit. defiance. and disregard for international standards for peace and security. First. on Monday. the Iranian regime sent a letter to the IAEA disclosing the existence of the second enrichment and refining facility. a site that the United States and Israeli intelligence reportedly have tracked for years. This missive denies that the site was intended for nuclear purposes. though the 3.000 centrifuges were clearly meant for weaponsgrade refinement. Moreover. the site was buried deep underground and under protection by the elite Revolutionary Guardnot the typical protocol for a peaceful energy site. On Wednesday. the Iranian President. Mr. Ahmadinejad. used his time on the rostrum at the United Nations not to welcome a new day of engagement with the international community but in typical fashion to rail against Israel. This desperate attempt to divert attention from his own internal political problems. as well as his governments deceitful nuclear program. once again showed this regime is not a responsible actor on the worlds stage. Irans people recognized this last June by voting against Mr. Ahmadinejad and his brand of politics. The world witnessed on live television how Mr. Ahmadinejad viewed the democratic process as his people paid dearly for the audacity of their vote. Finally. over the weekend. Irans news service reported three rounds of missile tests. including those capable of hitting Israel. GEN Hossein Salami. head of the Revolutionary Guard Air Force. said the drills were meant to show that Tehran is prepared to crush any military threat from another country. This erratic display will actually weaken. not strengthen. Irans hand in Geneva and will hopefully serve to convince our Russian and Chinese friends that the Iranian regime is not a credible actor nor a reliable trading partner. After this disturbing but strangely predictable week of Iranian regime behavior. American negotiators will head to Geneva. This is the first official and direct meeting with Iranian negotiators in 30 years. Leading the American delegation is Ambassador Bill Burns. one of Americas most respected diplomats. Having served in Russia. Ambassador Burns is well placed to address the complex international dimensions to this diplomatic problem. We will be well represented in Geneva. and I wish Ambassador Burns and his team all the best in what will surely be a challenging assignment. Iran is not going into these negotiations on sure footing. while the international community has never been more united. Led by the United States. Britain. Germany. and France. opposition to Irans nuclear program is based in fact. rooted in a willingness to engage. and backed up with a clear and firm message: An Iran with nuclear weapons is unacceptable under any circumstances. Let me repeat. An Iran with nuclear weapons is unacceptable under any circumstances. This message is gaining stronger resonance with Russia and China. The Russian Presidents comments at the University of Pittsburgh last week indicated a willingness to consider sanctions. This is a potentially remarkable breakthrough because if the Russians are willing to support international sanctions. the Chinese could be left alone among the P5+1 group in that determination. While China relies on Iran for substantial fuel imports. I trust they are carefully weighing their need for energy against Irans increasingly erratic and irresponsible behavior. The opportunity cost of doing business with this regime has increased considerably and may now be too high a price to pay. I hope the Chinese will support international efforts to pressure this Iranian regime at this critical time with the understanding that these efforts could ultimately result in a more reliable and stable partner in Tehran. It is next to impossible that the Iranian regime will be able to prove that its nuclear sites are for peaceful purposes by this Thursday. The Obama administration needs to be ready to move quickly and build on international momentum created over the past week to pressure this regime. That is why we in the Senate need to be ready to play our part. support the administration. and move on sanctions. We currently have two proposals on Iran pending before us. First. the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act is a measure introduced by Senator BROWNBACK and myself. We introduced this bill last May. This would allow State and local government pension funds to divest from companies that do more than $20 million in business with the Iranian energy sector. The second bill. the Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions Act. introduced by Senators BAYH and KYL. explicitly empowers the President to impose new economic sanctions on foreign firms involved in the export of gasoline and other refined petroleum products to the Islamic Republic of Iran. I am cosponsor of this bill. along with more than 75 of my Senate colleagues. The Iran Sanctions Enabling Act is modeled on similar legislation passed in response to the genocide in Sudan. Eighteen State legislatures have passed individual Iran sanction measures. and our legislation would bring these State efforts into line with Federal law. When President Obama was in the Senate. he introduced an earlier version of this legislation. It was right in 2007. and it is right in 2009. Analysts have estimated that Iran requires $20 billion annually in investments for its oil and natural gas sector. This sector directly provides funding for Irans nuclear program. as well as its support for international terrorism. Iran will only cease its illicit nuclear program. end its support for terrorists in Hamas and Hezbollah. and stop arming militant groups in Iraq when it is compelled to pay an economic price. We are entering a critical phase in President Obamas strategy of engagement with Iran where Tehran will face a true test. I hope the October 1 negotiation will lead to a freeze in Irans nuclear enrichment efforts and ultimately a nuclear weaponsfree Iran. Will the regime accept the Presidents genuine offer of dialog and comply with international nuclear standards or will it continue a losing strategy that serves to deepen its own isolation? These are questions for the Iranian regime. and they must answer these questions. If last week is any indication. Congress should be prepared to hand the President the leverage he needs to send a message to the regime that America cannot and will not accept an Iran with nuclear weapons. The administration needs all the tools at its disposal to increase pressure on the regime diplomatically. politically. and through more stringent economic sanctions. I call on my colleagues to listen to legislatures in so many States across the country that have passed divestment measures already. The American people do not want anything to do with investing in this regime. Lets pass divestment and petroleum sanctions and send a message to this regime and to the international community that a nucleararmed Iran is unacceptable. Mr. President. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.,111118141,CASEY,ROBERT,S,PA,M,D,,voting,2009-09-29,488,Mr. CASEY,23113,23394,09292009.txt,9347,1492,111,2009,mr presid rise respect iran nuclear

1110049775,Mr. President. today I am. along with Senators VOINOVICH. LEAHY. TESTER. BAUCUS. and CARPER. introducing the Providing for Additional :Security in States Identification Act of 2009. or the PASS ID Act. This bill represents a pragmatic apprbach to resolving many of the most troubling aspects of the REAL ID Act. which has been in place for the past 4 years. REAL ID was intended to implement the 9/11 Commissions recommendation for enhancing the secu: rity of drivers licenses. I support the 9/ 11 Commissions recommendation. but I have been a longtime opponent of the existing REAL ID Act due to the tremendous financial burden it imposes on States and the serious privacy risks it creates. Initially. DHS estimated the cost of implementing REAL ID to be $23 billion. of which $14 billion would be borne by the States. In the final regulations. DHSs overall cost estimate decreased to $10 billion. $4 billion of which States would have to pay. Many States are facing serious budget shortfalls .and simply cannot afford this cost. Additionally. REAL ID calls for all States to store copies of individuals documents such as birth certificates and their photographs in databases and to provide all other State Departments of Motor Vehicles with access to that information. REAL ID does not require any privacy protection of these State databases. which would contain massive amounts of personal information. These databases could provide onestop shopping for identity thieves and the backbone for a national identification database. Because of these problems. the Department of Homeland Security has been forced to provide a series of extensions for compliance. All 50 States plus the District of Columbia and the territories were granted extensions until December 31. 2009. DHS may automatically grant States further extensions to May 11. 2011. if they meet certain benchmarks for compliance. Under the final regulations. complete implementation is required by December 1. 2017. Even under this drawn out timeline. it is unclear if many States will comply. Several States. including Hawaii. have passed resolutions expressing their opposition to REAL ID. Eleven States have outright rejected REAL ID. putting millions of Americans at risk of not being able to enter Federal facilities or board commercial airplanes next year if they do not meet DHS benchmarks. Americans personal information could arso be compromised if REAL ID were to fully take effect in its current form. This simply cannot be allowed to happen. Because of my grave concerns with the REAL ID program. during the last Congress. I along with several of my colleagues introduced the Identity Security Enhancement Act. which would have repealed the REAL ID Act and replaced it with a negotiated rulemaking process that would have enhanced the security of State drivers licenses while also providing for strong privacy protections. Unfortunately. this bill did not advance. and we are now closer than ever to forcing states to ensure compliance with REAL ID. I along with my colleagues. the Department of Homeland Security. privacy and civil liberties groups. and the National Governors Association and National Council of State Legislatorsrepresenting a broad range of views on REAL IDhave been working together to develop a bill that will address the onerous problemswith REAL ID in a practical manner that can win bipartisan support. I believe that the bill we are introducing represents a pragmatic alternative to REAL ID. which will save States considerable money and address the most troubling aspects of the REAL ID Act.,111116411,AKAKA,DANIEL,S,HI,M,D,,voting,2009-06-15,26,Mr. AKAKA,3243,3344,06152009.txt,3592,573,111,2009,mr presid today along senat voinovich leahi tester baucu carper introduc provid addit secur state identif act pass id act bill repres pragmat resolv mani troubl aspect real id act place past year real id intend implement commiss recommend enhanc secu riti driver licens support commiss recommend longtim oppon exist real id act due tremend financi burden impos state seriou privaci risk creat initi dh estim cost implement real id billion billion would born state final regul dhss overal cost estim decreas billion billion state would pay mani state face seriou budget shortfal simpli afford cost addit real id call state store copi individu document birth certif photograph databas provid state depart motor vehicl access inform real id requir privaci protect state databas would contain massiv amount person inform databas could provid onestop shop ident thiev backbon nation identif databas problem depart homeland secur forc provid seri extens complianc state plu district columbia territori grant extens decemb dh may automat grant state extens may meet certain benchmark complianc final regul complet implement requir decemb even drawn timelin unclear mani state compli sever state includ hawaii pass resolut express opposit real id eleven state outright reject real id put million american risk abl enter feder facil board commerci airplan next year meet dh benchmark american person inform could compromis real id fulli take effect current form simpli allow happen grave concern real id program last congress along sever colleagu introduc ident secur enhanc act would repeal real id act replac negoti rulemak process would enhanc secur state driver licens also provid strong privaci protect unfortun bill advanc closer ever forc state ensur complianc real id along colleagu depart homeland secur privaci civil liberti group nation governor associ nation council state broad rang view real work togeth develop bill address oner problemswith real id practic manner win bipartisan support believ bill introduc repres pragmat altern real id save state consider money address troubl aspect real id act,329,FALSE
1110048085,"Mr. President. I rise today to talk about health care reform. What else in regard to the interests of the American people and what we are doing here? As the Republican leader. Senator MCCONNELL. has pointed out in several floor speeches over the past week or so. the desire for health care reform on both sides of the aisle is one that unites this Chamber across both political and geographic boundaries. Our system of health care produces some of the best care in the world and it is the driver of a substantial share of the medical innovations that have wiped out diseases. improved our comfort. and extended our time on this Earth. However. this system is not truly accessible to everybody. -and that is the problem. That is what this entire debate boils down to: your ability to have -access to a doctor. to. go see the doctor of your choice when you need to see that doctor. Solving this problem of access is exceedingly complicated. partly because it evidences itself in so many diverse ways all across the country. so many geographical areas. For example. in our rural areas in Kansas. we are struggling with attracting and retaining doctors and keeping the doors open to our hospitals. to our pharmacies. and clinics. We talk about recruiting athletes. My goodness. the business of recruiting doctors and health care professionals is equally as competitive. In our urban areas such as Kansas City and Wichita. our providers face very different challenges which are just as. daunting and which threaten a patients ability to access health care. On top of that. although some 250 million Americans have health insurance. somewhere in the neighborhood of 27 to 47 million. depending on who you are counting and who is talking. do not. That makes accessing health care expensive and very challenging for them. In addition. the governmentrun Medicare Program. which is on the verge of bankruptcy. by the way. does not pay doctors and pharmacists and ambulance drivers and nurse clinicians--pardon me. clinical lab folks and home health care providers and almost every health care provider that you can namethey do not pay. them enough to cover their cost. Unless these providers have a nonMedicare population to recoup their losses. they cannot stay in business and their patients lose outa de facto rationing of health care. As a member of both the Finance and HELP Committees. and. the cochair of the SenateRural Health Care Caucus. I am able to participate and have been participating. along with staff. in this complex and very difficult effort. We must reform our health care system into one that guarantees meaningful access for all Americans. and guarantees that patientdoctor relationship. However. this effort to date has been a tale of rhetoric versus that of reality. the promise of cooperation contrastedwith the unfortilnate but real fact of partisanship. something I do not like to say. Let me explain. President Obama. who ran as a ""postpartisan"" candidate. has made many overtures to Republicans indicatinga desire for this process to be bipartisan. He just met with some members of our leadership and obviously the leadership on the other side of the aisle as of today. Others in the Senate have declared their goal to be a bill that attracts upward of 70 votes. Is :that possible? I would hope so. It could be. That would be a tremendous victory for the Senate of the United States and the American people. But the reality is something very different. Today in the HELP Committee. the Health. Education. Labor and Pensions Committee. we have just begun the process of walking through a 615page bill that we are scheduled to mark up next Tuesday. This bill does not have one single Republican contribution. as far as I can tell. Moreover. it is incomplete. with many details missing. For example. the small detail of how much it will cost. There is no cost estimate to this bill of 615 pages. just going through it as. of today. going to try to mark it up next. Tuesday. Come on. That is not the way we should be doing business. The Finance Committee has conducted a parallel and I think. quite frankly. a better process so far. and I wish to thank Chairman BAucus and Ranking Member GRASSLEY and their staffs for their efforts. But we still have not seen a detailed proposal or cost estimate. and we are being pushed to mark something up in the next few weeks as well. I want everyone to understand why process is important. Health care reform is important. to be sure. Getting things done obviously is important. But so is process. It is not because I do not want health care reform. nor is any Member in this body in a position to say they do not want health care reform. I want every single Kansan. every single American. to be able to see the doctor of their choice when they want to. especially when they have to. I speak today because this health care reform bill will likely involve one of the biggest. most important votes that I or any one of my colleagues will cast during the time we are privileged. to serve in the Senate of the United States. This health care reform bill will affect the lives of every single American. It will reform a system that drives onesixth of our economy. over 16 million American jobs. It will have consequences for medical science and innovation that improve the lives of not only those of us in this great country but all across the world.. When people are really sick. they come to the United States. This bill will spend upwards of $2 trillion2 trillionour children and grandchildren will have to some day repay. If we are going to do this. we cannot afford to get it wrong. For this reason. I initiated a letter about a week ago on behalf of all of my Republican colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee and on the HELP Committee. I asked the chairmen of those respective committees. the distinguished chairman. Senator DODD. who is now serving in Senator KENNEDYS absence. to give this process the time and the careful consideration it deserves. That was the message of the letter: Give us the time and the very careful consideration this vital issue deserves. It seems to -me our requests have been extremely reasonable. First. please provide us with your detailed plan with enough time for us to read it. to understand it. and get feedback from our constituents back home. the people the bill will affect. We have done this in the Finance Committee. Goodness knows I do not know how many panels we have had. how many walkthroughs. how many slide presentations. Boy. that is tough in the afternoon to turn the lights off as Senators and try to pay attention to fact after fact after fact and suggestion after suggestion after suggestion and policy objective after policy objective on each day as we go through the legislative swamp. -to try to get this from here. Our requests. again. I thinkI want to say it again. First. you should provide us with your detailed plan with enough time for us to read it. understand it. get feedback from our constituents back home. the people the bill will affect. The reason I said that twice is that every day we had one of these slide shows. every day we had a PowerPoint. every day we got more information. our office would send it back to the providers of health care in Kansas. much in the same fashion as members of the committee would send to it their people. and say: Hey. is this going to work? These are the people who actually do provide the health care. I know the arguments that say: Well. now. wait a minute. We need to cut out fraud. waste. and abuse. and we need to be much more cost conscious. We need better practices in regard to better medical practices. We need a lot of things to either suggest or to incentivize or to maintain what the health care providdrs do. But in the end result. if that person is sick. they are going to have to see a doctor. and they are going to have to see a nurse or some health care provider. So in the end result. we better at least be doing something that the providers say. yes. this makes common sense or you are going to see either one of two things: You are going to see a political revolt when they say. no. we are not going to go down that road or else you are going to see a continuation of rationing where providers say: No. I am not going to take part anymore in the Medicare Program. because I am not getting reimbursed up to cost. You can have the best government program in the world. you can have the best government card in the world. But if you cannot find a doctor who provides service or a home health care provider who will -provide service. or any provider who .will provide that service well. where are you? Second. I would like to see provided the cost estimates from the. Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Tax Committee. Let us know how much all of this is going to cost. That is extremely important. We are hearing anything from $1 to $2 trillion. Then. lastly. how will it be paid for? I know we are into an era now where basically we have the printing presses rolling. and we have an Economic Recovery Act and we have many facets of that. we have the stimulus. the omnibus. we had the Presidents budget and we had TARP. and we had four different other acronyms under TARP. and we did not worry too much about the payfors and who was going to pay for it. We let the printing presses roll. because. nobody wanted to see economic Armageddon. Could we have done it better? I think so. But that is yesterdays decision. So we should identify how this will be paid for or are we not going to pay for it. Are we simply going to go aheadthere has been some discussion about some aspects of it that you would not pay for. There are other aspects that we need to go into. because they involve probable tax increases. and now is not the time to be increasing taxes. especially on the small business community. despite the need for health care reform. I think asking for these details is absolutely fair. I think it is necessary under the circumstances. In fact. I would be ignoring my responsibilities to my constituents in Kansas if I did not demand these conditions be met. Every single Republican member of the Finance Committee and HELP Committee signed the letter. Every single one expressed a desire to work with our colleagues to achieve bipartisan health care reform. "" That brings me back to todays HELP Committee walkthrough of 615 pages of an incomplete draft. the rushed HELP and Finance markup schedule. Tuesday. and then in about a week or two. the arbitrary floor debate deadlines that we hear from leadership. I hopeour letter will slow this hurried dash to an imaginary finish line. Slow it down. Slow it down. I know it is extremely important that we pass good health care reform legislation. It is also extremely important to prevent bad legislation from passing and get America saddled with it for about 20 or 25 years. I wish at the end of every committee room. if in fact the bill gets to committee. the committee of jurisdiction. that we can hold appropriate hearings. we would have a sign that says. ""Do no harm."" And then right below it perhaps we could put. ""whoa."" until everybody can slow down and read it in regard to process. and ost. and specifics of the bill. and trying to work together to get a good product. There is no reason why the Senate should rush through a bill that has this much at stake. So time out. Time out. Time. Slow down. Give us the details. That is all we are asking for. The people of this great Nation deserve nothing less. Lets- get health care reform and lets get it right.

1110019213,Mr. Speaker.- last weekend I had the opportunity to visit our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and was able to thank them personally for their selfless sacrifice and for their service to our country. From the moment that I arrived in country along with five of our colleagues. there was an extreme sense of pride. purpose. and confidence in the soldiers we met. These troops are led by the finest military leaders in the world. such as General Ray Odierno. General David McKiernan. General Lloyd Austin. to name just a few. with each of their commands providing superb support. So I come to the floor today. with a message from the troops. a message that I found somewhat selfless. but not at all surprising coming from these fine men and women. Mr. Speaker. they asked me to tell the stories of their success. that theyre making a difference. That the cutandrun strategy that politicians. who have absolutely zero battlefield let alone military experience. preach from this floor is not the support that they and their families expect or deserve. So with that I tell you a story about a womens health clinic in Baghdad. This clinic. like many in Iraq. has intermittent electricity throughout the day and little. if any. after the sun goes down. After spending 28 years in healthcare. I can tell you that I know firsthand you cannot decide when a baby decides to be born or when an emergency occurs. So what did our soldiers do? Well. they did a lot. For example. they installed solar panels on the roof of the clinic and batteries to store that energy. That clinic is now operational 24 hours a day. 7 days a week. providing much needed care to women and babies in need. And I assure you.

1110067317,Mr. President. I thank the Senator. Could I go back. again. and reemphasize with my colleagues and the American people what is very odious about the bill that is before us. that is. the Madoffstyle budget gimmickry associated with this legislation. In 40 daysin 40 daystax increases and Medicare cuts of approximately $1 trillion will beginin 40 days. That is 6 weeks from now. But any benefits that would accrue from this legislation would begin in 208 weeks1.460 days. So why in the world would we approveand. obviously. we know why it is done. It is to make the budget look better. when it is deception being perpetrated on the American people because we are not telling them the true cost. We are not telling the truth because. if the benefits started at the same time the taxes started. it would be a $2.5 trillion deficit over 10 years. It is unfair to the American people. who are going to have to foot the bill for this massive piece of legislationit is unfair to them to tell them they are going to have to start paying the taxes and footing the bill for it and only 4 years later would any benefits come to them. I think that is a really wrong thing to do to the American people. Do you know what. The American people are beginning to figure it out. Mr. President. 51 to 35. the American people do not want this. The American people do not want an increase in the deficit. They want the spending stopped. and they are figuring it out.

They have the longest winning streak in the country. 25 games. and they have the Coach of the Year in John Calipari. We have a great team that came just inches away from winning the national championship last year. We were seeded number two this year rather than number one where we should have been. But this is the opportunity to show who deserves to Le seeded number one. The University of Memphis Tigers that bring my community together and do something that basketball and sports can do for this country in bringing us together in difficult times and giving us a pastime that is so important will do well. and our city will cheer for them and see that they do well.

1110022800,"I thank very much the gentleman for yielding. And I appreciate your having this very important discussion this evening. I have been sitting here listening to the other gentlemen this evening. I have been having what we call ""courthouse conferences"" in my district. What I have been doing is I have i6een going around the district. We go to two counties a day when we are not in session. We are there from about 8 oclock in the morning to about 12:30 in one county. and then 1:30 to 6 in another county. and I meet with constituents almost every 10 minutes. What you have .been talking about is on the minds not only of your constituents. and your constituents in Pennsylvania. but constituents across this country. And I will tell you. the question on their minds is about jobs. And it is about saving that wealth that they tried to accumulate. as you said. in their 401(k)s and their IRAs. They are worried about the Federal spending that is going on out there. Youre absolutely right. The smallbusiness owners are the ones that are creating the jobs in our area right now. A lot of people think it is the big corporations. No. It is not. It is those smaller companies. I sit across the table from these individuals. They look you in the face and they say. ""do you know what? Im not sure how I am going to keep my doors open. We are having a liquidity problem. We are having a problem where we are losing our orders."" But there is one thing that they all say. They all say the same thing: ""I feel a responsibility to the people I hire. How am I going to look those people in the face in a few months? I have 20 employees or 30 employees. And I have to start laying these people off. These people not only work for me. but they are part of my family now. They live down the street from me."" Youre absolutely right. We are going down that road of ruin. It was not that long ago. back in the Carter administration. when we saw interest rates in this country go up to 21 percent. And what did that do? As you said. Federal Government does not create any wealth. We consume wealth. It is that small entrepreneur out there that creates the wealth for this great country of ours. So when we watch what happened back in the Carter administration. it is not that long ago that you couldnt go down to the local bank and get a mortgage. You couldnt get a loan. I started practicing law back in those days. We had to do what they call ""laying contracts."" where the seller actually had to do the financing for the buyer because there was no money. I will tell you. the last thing we want to see in this country is interest rates going back to 21 percent. I remember. though. you could get a money market at that time. you could get a 14 percent return on your money. But if you are paying 21 percent. youre in the hole. So not only the folks back home in northxiest and north central Ohio are scared. but people across this country. They tell us. ""here we are in our businesses cutting back. We are trying to scale back in every possible way that we possibly can. But whats the Federal Government doing?"" They just see us with the $700 billion bailout last fall for the financial institutions. And then they find out about AIG and the big pay outs. And they ask how about the stimulus package. how is that going to help me? How is the $75 billion on the mortgage bailout going to help me? What is going to be in it for me with the $410 billion omnibus. And as the gentleman talked about. we might be talking about another stimulus package. Who is going to pay for it?

This legislation is an important first step In reforming the defense acquisitions process. We know that due to insufficient oversight. acquisition programs have continued to skyrocket in costs. The cost growth of weapons systems acquisition has been a huge drain on taxpayer dollars--with minimal growth estimates of at least $166 billion. A 20 percent improvement in these numbers could save the taxpayers up to $30 billion. This legislation ensures accuracy in performance assessments by designating an official to conduct performance assessments. In addition. it establishes additional annual reviews from oversight officials for problem contracts. These reviews. coupled with additional congressional oversight of the ailing programs. will help keep programs on track.  Finafly-"". this legislation creates a better system to. track cost growth during early contract ddvelopment. By the time system development beins. 75 percent of the costs are already in place. By regulating cost growth in the early development. we will have true cost estimates and we can seek alternative solutions if its necessary.

1110005427,Mr. President. basically the amendment requires States to certify that 95 percent of their CHIP children. or Medicaid. are being paid first before the children of legal immigrants. No State meets that requirement. I might also say the nationwide average for covering children under 200 percent of poverty is 80 percent. No State reaches 95. It is too high a standard. More than that. we do include in this bill provisions for bonus payments to States to encourage them to cover lowincome kids first. I think it would be inappropriate and unfair to make it an ironclad requirement that States must certify 95 percent. These are kids who are- sick through no fault of their own. Their parents are paying taxes. They are full citizensthey are legal immigrants. but they are already incorporated into the system. being taxed. et cetera. and their kids should not be penalized.

1110055178,"Mr. Chair. I rise to note my concerns about the Grayson amendment to H.R. 2647. the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010. As Chair of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform with jurisdiction over procurement issues. I share Mr. GRAYSONS desire to ensure that Our procurement process uses taxpayer dollars most efficiently and obtains the lowest possible prices. However. I am concerned that the Grayson amendment could conflict with the Administrations acquisition reform policies. would remove the ability of acquisition professionals to determine the ""Best Value"" for the taxpayers dollars. and would significantly overburden the heads of agencies. President Obama made it clear in his Memorandumh of March 4. 2009. Government Contracting. Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies. that acquisition professionals should be entrusted to determine the ""best value"" for taxpayer dollars in each procurement: ""The Federal Governmenthas an overriding obligation to American taxpayers. It should perform its functions efficiently and effectively while ensuring that its actions result in the best value for the taxpayers."" The Administration has made it clear that acquisition professionals ""must have the flexibility to tailor contracts to carry out their missions and achieve the policy goals of the Government."" The Grayson amendment would. unnecessarily restrict ""Best Value"" analysis. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (""FAR"") defines ""Best Value"" as ""the expected outcome of an acquisition that. in the Governments estimation. provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement."" Instead of predetermining the most important factors for consideration in an acquisition. our current system places that judgment in the hands of the acquisition professionals. These professionals tailor the evaluation factors for each individual acquisition to the particular needs of that acquisition. This process results in the ""Best Value"" for each taxpayer dollar. The FAR requires that price must always be considered in every source selection. But importantly. its importance must be considered in comparison to other criteria. including past performance. compliance with solicitation requirements. technical excellence. management capability. personnel qualifications. and prior experience.- Additionally. all the factors and significant subfactors that will affect contract award and their relative importance must be stated clearly in the solicitation. I believe that the goal of Mr. GRAYSONS amendment is to prevent situations where price receives minimal consideration in the acquisition process. I share this concern. and the Committee has received information that price has been routinely ignored as a major evaluation factor. Reforms are needed to ensure that price is treated as a critical criterion that is not given short shrift in the best value analysis. However. the Grayson amendment would set a rigid numerical formula for consideration of price. which may not be appropriate in all circumstances. By requiring price to be ""at least equal to all other factors combined."" this amendment would return our procurement process to the lowest price technically acceptable or sealed bid methods of the past. which failed to achieve the maximum yield for each tax dollar spent. Furthermore. this amendment would require the head of every agency who finds other factors more important than price (such as time of delivery. etc.) to issue a waiver. This process would be an overwhelming and unnecessary distraction for agency heads. Mr. Chair. my concern about this amendment is about getting the best value for each tax dollar spent. I would like to continue to work together with Mr. GRAYSON to address his very legitimate concerns about the Importance of price as an evaluation factor in the procurement process. However for the reasons discussed above. I cannot support this amendment in its present form.",111117170,TOWNS,EDOLPHUS,H,NY,M,D,10,voting,2009-06-25,503,Mr. TOWNS,50354,50452,06252009.txt,3976,593,111,2009,mr chair rise note concern grayson amend hr nation defens author act fiscal year chair committe oversight govern reform jurisdict procur issu share mr grayson desir ensur procur process use taxpay dollar effici obtain lowest possibl price howev concern grayson amend could conflict administr acquisit reform polici would remov abil acquisit profession determin best valu taxpay dollar would significantli overburden head agenc presid obama made clear march govern contract memorandum head execut depart agenc acquisit profession entrust determin best valu taxpay dollar procur feder governmentha overrid oblig american taxpay perform function effici effect ensur action result best valu taxpay administr made clear acquisit profession must flexibl tailor contract carri mission achiev polici goal govern grayson amend would unnecessarili restrict best valu analysi feder acquisit regul far defin best valu expect outcom acquisit govern estim provid greatest overal benefit respons requir instead predetermin import factor consider acquisit current system place judgment hand acquisit profession profession tailor evalu factor individu acquisit particular need acquisit process result best valu taxpay dollar far requir price must alway consid everi sourc select importantli import must consid comparison criteria includ past perform complianc solicit requir technic excel manag capabl personnel qualif prior experi addit factor signific affect contract award rel import must state clearli solicit believ goal mr grayson amend prevent situat price receiv minim consider acquisit process share concern committe receiv inform price routin ignor major evalu factor reform need ensur price treat critic criterion given short shrift best valu analysi howev grayson amend would set rigid numer formula consider price may appropri circumst requir price least equal factor combin amend would return procur process lowest price technic accept seal bid method past fail achiev maximum yield tax dollar spent furthermor amend would requir head everi agenc find factor import price time deliveri etc issu waiver process would overwhelm unnecessari distract agenc head mr chair concern amend get best valu tax dollar spent would like continu work togeth mr grayson address legitim concern import price evalu factor procur process howev reason discuss support amend present form,343,FALSE
1110053027,"Mr. President. I would like to talk a bit about health care. since that seems to be a major issue also of concern to all Americans. Today is June 22. 2009. Millions of Americans still lack health insurance coverage. and we need to pass reforms that help them get coverage. Yet more time has gone by with no plan from the majority. While we wait. how many more people will forgo needed care today? How many emergency rooms will have to care for Americans who could have received care earlier. and at a lower cost. from a medical professional if they had insurance? The majority talks about reform and how critical it is to move with urgency. They also assert that the economic recovery depends on health care reform. So many of us would like to know: Where is the plan? It is impossible for us to move forward in any manner. let alone with urgency. if we do not even have a complete bill. On Tuesday June 9. after months of waiting. the majority in the HELP Committee. on which I serve. offered a partial list of health reform proposals. indicating that the missing pieces would be shortly forthcoming. The majority quickly pulled together a roundtable to discuss a wide variety of issues. They even held some walkthroughs with our side on issues of prevention. quality. et cetera. The following week we were told we would receive the missing pieces ""soon"" or ""early last week."" Then we were told they would come forward with the missing pieces ""this past Friday."" Now it is Monday and we have received nothing. While we have waited. the Congressional Budget Office told us what many of us had expected and feared about this bill: The cost of the bill would have a cost exponentially higher than many had predicted. In fact. the incomplete bill would cost over $1 trillion. and this cost would only cover onethird of the 48 million Americans who are currently uninsured. So we wait and wait and wait. having no details of the muchwanted government plan or the proposal regarding penalties the other side wants to impose on employers who either cannot provide health coverage or who are not able to provide the coverage according to the government dictate. Now we hear this Friday might be the day we have a chance to see what they have been working on behind closed doors. Friday also happens to be the day of the Fourth of July recess. The President and congressional Democrats have told the American people that health care reform legislation must be passed by the Senate prior to the August recess. Given that we will not have the text of the legislation prior to the Fourth of July recess. I am skeptical that the HELP Committee and the Finance Committee will be able to complete their work. combine two possibly divergent bills on the Senate floor. and pass a bill during the 5 weeks remaining in the July work session. One thing I have found out around here is that we miss a lot of things. but we never miss a recess. The Senate passed the budget blueprint in late April. That included a possible budget reconciliation process for considering health care reform legislation. One must wonder. One must wonder if the majority is intentionally pushing back the schedule and dragging out this process so that a bipartisan process and solution is not feasible. Under budget reconciliation. which sounds arcane to most Americans. the majority would be allowed to jam this important policy through the Senate with 51 votes instead of the typical 60. with limited time for debate and amendments. I am left to wonder if this contingency was not planned on all along. to use reconciliation. to muscle through the health reform we all know is desperately needed but to circumvent the normal procedures of the Senate. I and my colleagues on this side of the aisle continue to await the Democrats complete bill and their plan to make taxpayers pay for this trillion dollar new government program. So many questions remain until the missing parts of the bill are provided. When will we get details of the government insurance plan we are told is essential to reform? When will we see what employer health care mandates look like? How much will the complete plan cost? How will it be paid for? Each day the majority fails to provide a complete plan. along with the complete cost and how it will be paid for. is another day that millions of Americans go without health insurance. Mr. President.

1110012186,Im fine. KEITH. Thank you again for pulling together a -Progressive Caucus Special Order and for making it something that we want to come down here and talk from our perspectives about as to whats going on in our Congress and in our country and overall in our world. Right now. this country of -urs. this Congress of ours and certainly every single person I saw in my districtMatin and Sonoma Countiesover the weekend are all talking about one thing. and that is the stimulus package. the recovery package. that we are debating between the House and the Senate. Now. after 1 week and 1 day of electing a new President. the House passed the Presidents recovery package. and we are proud of it. The Senate has changed it slightlyconsiderably. Really and truly. 90 percent is overlap in one way or another. but there are some misses that our leadership will have to deal with in conference. I dont know how many people understand what happens when the House passes a piece of legislation on an issue and then when the Senate passes a different piece of legislation on the same issue. In order to have a law. we have to have conferencing between the House and the Senate. Its bipartisan with Republicais and Democrats. The conferees go into a room. and they start working out the differences. The only thing they talk about is where the two pieces of legislation differ and where they can come together and agree. So now. what does this have to do with the Progressive Caucus?

1110004846,"Mr. President. Melvin Dubee. one of the Senates most highly valued staff members and one to whom I am personally grateful. will soon conclude two decades of government service in order to apply his considerable talents in the private sector. While I do not. for a moment. believe that this is the end of Melvins public dutiesone day a wise official will certainly summon him back to public .serviceit is fitting to note his accQmplishments to date. As evident to even casual observers. particularly around key Longhorn or Cowboy games. Melvin has roots in Texas. where he received at the University of Texas at Arlington a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in finance. His path to public service then included a Masters degree in international affairs from George Washington University in 1988 and two years as a Presidential management intern between 1987 and 1989. The Presidential Management Intern Program was established by President Carter to attract to Federal service. through a national competition. outstanding individuals from a variety of disciplines who are interested in a career in Federal service. During the internship Melvin worked in the Office of the Inspector General in the Department of Defense. where he began to build expertise in defense issues that carried into his Senate work. During that time he received a congressional fellowship. which introduced him to the Senate in the office of the Senates master teacher. my senior Senator. ROBERT BYRD. where Melvin continued to work on defense management issues. It doesnt take long for those with whom Melvin works to be impressed by his considerable skills and calm demeanor. His audition as a Congressional Fellow led to 5 years of service as national security assistant to Senator BYRD. between 1989 and 1994. In that capacity. he advised Senator BYRD. who was then in the midst of his distinguished leadership of the Senate Appropriations Committee. on foreign policy and defense issues. This included serving as Senator BYRDs staff representative to the Armed Services Committee. during which Melvin complemented his growing knowledge of defense issues with his impressive legislative process skills concerning hearings. markups. floor action. conference committee negotiations. and negotiations with other congressional offices and with the Executive Branch. In 1994. Melvin began his service on the Senate Intelligence Committee. This service continued until now with brief interruptions. including a year during President Clintons administration in the Office of National Drug Policy where he advised Director Barry McCaffrey on that offices interaction with Congress. Melvin has contributed to the committee in a variety of positions. As a professional staff member. which is the general entry point for our staff. Melvin developed expertise in a number of key intelligence community oversight issues. including counterdrug. counterterrorism. international organized crime issues. as well as area expertise concerning Latin America and Southeast Asia. As a professional staff member. he also served as an adviser and liaison to Senator JOHN KERRY and then to me. during the early part of my service on the committee in 2001. One of Melvins particular contributions during that time was leadership of the committees investigation of the tragic April- 2001 shootdown of a U.S. missionary plane in Peru. Our report. entitled ""Report on a Review of United States Assistance to Peruvian CounterDrug Air Interdiction Efforts and the Shootdown of a Civilian Aircraft on April 20. 2001."" S. Prt. 10764. bears witness to a number of his skills. They include an ability to gather and carefully analyze facts. write accurately and clearly. help the Committee draw sound conclusions and make needed recommendations. and do so in a manner that draws bipartisan support. And. I should add. also to do all that expeditiously so that the committeewas able to report publicly within 6 moflths of the incident. The skills that Melvin amply demonstrated as a professional staff member led to his selection to fill two key staff management positions. From mid2001 through 2002. Melvin served as the committees budget director. Our budget director post is an immensely important responsibility. The total national intelligence budget when Melvin was budget director is classified. But we have declassified the top line for the last 2 fiscal years. The most recent figure. $47.5 billion in fiscal year 2008. conveys the importance of the teek of rpviewin!. making recommendations about. and monitoring implementation of the Nations intelligence budget. As budget director. Melvin led the committees budget monitors for each of the individual intelligence community elements in scouring the Presidents budget numbers.and evaluating the broad span of human and technical collection. analytical. acquisition. and management issues they involve. The budget director arranges for the presentation of these issues at classified hearings of the committee. their consideration at committee markups. coordination with the Senate Armed Services and Appropriations Committees. and negotiation with the House and also with the Executive Branch. This work is at the heart of the committees responsibilities. Confidence in Melvin. starting with former Vice Chairman Richard Bryan in 2000 and then myself from 2003 through the 110th Congress. also led to Melvins designation as deputy staff director. initially on the minority side and then beginning in 2007 as the committees deputy staff director. There are two aspects of that responsibility. One is leadership within the staff. helping it to maintain the high level of professionalism and effectiveness that has been the hallmark of our Intelligence Committee staffs. The other is being a close adviser to the chairman or vice chairman. as the case may be. on the full breadth of issues relating to the oversight of the U.S. intelligence community. In both respects. as a partner with the staff director in managing the committee and as a close adviser to me. Melvin performed magnificently. On a daily basis. I most often saw Melvin as a trusted adviser. In that role. Melvin combines key capabilities and attributes. Melvin knows his material. This includes current intelligence and historical background. It includes detailed knowledge of the elements of the intelligence community. from the CIA. to components of the Defense Department. to intelligence elements in the State. Treasury. and Energy Departments. as well as the FBI. And it includes knowledge of the functioning of the Senate. with respect not only to the Intelligence Committee. but also to the committees with which we work. and its leadership and floor proceedings. Melvin has an admirable ability to express his considerable knowledge succinctly and clearly. He has no hesitation in expressing disagreement or dissent. respectfully but clearly. particularly when a matter of principle is involved. as is often the case when addressing sensitive matters. When a decision is made. he has an uncanny ability to find and recommend the right words for remarks in committee. on the floor. in letters or press releases. or in speeches outside the Senate. And. in all of our endeavors. Melvin has been forever guided by a deep commitment to the pucteution of our Nation and our values. It would he incomplete. huwever. to talk only about Melvin at work. A glance at his wall of photographs. an opportunity to hear him talk about his family. and the chance to meet his wife and two daughters. make it clear that Melvin and his wife Kristine Johnson are loving and- imaginative parents. and that Melvins priorities have always been right on the mark. As may often be the case when someone leaves the Senate for the private sector. daughters Katrina and Eliza may find that Dad is able to get home a little earlier to join them at dinner. With gratitude for his service to the Senate and the Nation. for myself and the many others who have benefited from it. I wish Melvin the best in the time ahead.",111117461,ROCKEFELLER,JOHN,S,WV,M,D,,voting,2009-01-22,614,Mr. ROCKEFELLER,23562,23800,01222009.txt,8069,1279,111,2009,mr presid melvin dube one senat highli valu staff member one person grate soon conclud two decad govern servic order appli consider talent privat sector moment believ end melvin public day wise offici certainli summon back public fit note date evid even casual observ particularli around key longhorn cowboy game melvin root texa receiv univers texa arlington bachelor busi administr degre financ path public servic includ master degre intern affair georg washington univers two year presidenti manag intern presidenti manag intern program establish presid carter attract feder servic nation competit outstand individu varieti disciplin interest career feder servic internship melvin work offic inspector gener depart defens began build expertis defens issu carri senat work time receiv congression fellowship introduc senat offic senat master teacher senior senat robert byrd melvin continu work defens manag issu doesnt take long melvin work impress consider skill calm demeanor audit congression fellow led year servic nation secur assist senat byrd capac advis senat byrd midst distinguish leadership senat appropri committe foreign polici defens issu includ serv senat byrd staff repres arm servic committe melvin complement grow knowledg defens issu impress legisl process skill concern hear markup floor action confer committe negoti negoti congression offic execut branch melvin began servic senat intellig committe servic continu brief interrupt includ year presid clinton administr offic nation drug polici advis director barri mccaffrey offic interact congress melvin contribut committe varieti posit profession staff member gener entri point staff melvin develop expertis number key intellig commun oversight issu includ counterdrug counterterror intern organ crime issu well area expertis concern latin america southeast asia profession staff member also serv advis liaison senat john kerri earli part servic committe one melvin particular contribut time leadership committe investig tragic april shootdown us missionari plane peru report entitl report review unit state assist peruvian counterdrug air interdict effort shootdown civilian aircraft april prt bear wit number skill includ abil gather care analyz fact write accur clearli help committe draw sound conclus make need recommend manner draw bipartisan support add also expediti committeewa abl report publicli within incid skill melvin ampli demonstr profession staff member led select fill two key staff manag posit mid melvin serv committe budget director budget director post immens import respons total nation intellig budget melvin budget director classifi declassifi top line last fiscal year recent figur billion fiscal year convey import make recommend monitor implement nation intellig budget budget director melvin led committe budget monitor individu intellig commun element scour presid budget numbersand evalu broad span human technic collect analyt acquisit manag issu involv budget director arrang present issu classifi hear committe consider committe markup coordin senat arm servic appropri committe negoti hous also execut branch work heart committe respons confid melvin start former vice chairman richard bryan th congress also led melvin design deputi staff director initi minor side begin committe deputi staff director two aspect respons one leadership within staff help maintain high level profession effect hallmark intellig committe staff close advis chairman vice chairman case may full breadth issu relat oversight us intellig commun respect partner staff director manag committe close advis melvin perform magnific daili basi often saw melvin trust advis role melvin combin key capabl attribut melvin know materi includ current intellig histor background includ detail knowledg element intellig commun cia compon defens depart intellig element state treasuri energi depart well fbi includ knowledg function senat respect intellig committe also committe work leadership floor proceed melvin admir abil express consider knowledg succinctli clearli hesit express disagr dissent respect clearli particularli matter principl involv often case address sensit matter decis made uncanni abil find recommend right word remark committe floor letter press releas speech outsid senat endeavor melvin forev guid deep commit nation valu would incomplet talk melvin work glanc wall photograph opportun hear talk famili chanc meet wife two daughter make clear melvin wife kristin johnson love imagin parent melvin prioriti alway right mark may often case someon leav senat privat sector daughter katrina eliza may find dad abl get home littl earlier join dinner gratitud servic senat nation mani other benefit wish melvin best time ahead,690,FALSE
1110002615,Well. I thank the gentleman. and I do have lots of thoughts on the subject. Ill share just a few of them with my colleagues. And of course weve gotten into discussion now of a philosophical and practical discussion of why tax reform. cutting taxes. first and foremost. and if not doing that. going to a different system. My colleague from Iowa talked about- a consumption tax. No more tax on productivity. No more tax on earnings and savings. but on consumption. And I think youve shown very well. the gentleman from Missouri. with his charts. that that grows the revenue. And certainly. the tax cuts of 2001. 2003. under the Bush administration. even though there was a price tag put on that of $1.3 trillion. these cuts in tax rates would result. theoretically. the way we score. in $1.3 trillion less tax. but in dynamic scoring. as you presented in these excellent slides. weve proven that we grow the revenue. But Im going to tell you. my colleague. let me make this point if I can. and then Ill yield back to you because it is your time. But Mr. Speaker. the thing that strikes me over and over again is. even when were cutting taxes. even if we are able to pass the RSC bill. the Economic Recovery and Middle Class Tax Relief Act of 2009. I truly believe we will grow revenue. once again. But we cannot continue to spend wildly. We desperately. my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I think you would agree with me. until we get to the point where we have a balanced budget amendment and we do what the States domy own State of Georgia right now has a $2 billion shortfall. and our governor is struggling. just like the other 49 States. But the legislature will deal with that and they will tighten their belt. just as we have to do on an individual basis. on a family basis. You know. instead of getting that $40 hair cut every 2 weeks. you get a $20 hair cut every 4 weeks. You tighten that belt. And thats the one thing we have not been able to do up here. We just start writing checks. printing money. And thats. my colleagues were talking about. the gentleman from Ohio and the gentleman from Iowa. a $1 trillion deficit in 1 year? Yeah. that does lead to $13 trillion worth of debt and red ink. And so I think its important for us to make sure we stay on that issue of. we cannot. no matter what we do with our Tax Code. we cannot continue to spend money.

1110064317,If I could reclaim my time. I would like to just underscore the point my friend has made. We regularly hear that free trade agreements lead to job losses in the United States. That is a mantra that many people. unfortunately. are beating. when in fact the empirical evidence we have. history has shown the opposite in fact to be the case. In fact. we enjoy a trade surplus with our free trade agreement. FTA. trading partners as a whole. and the country with which we dont happens to be Mexico. There is a reason for that. It is our purchase of oil from Mexico. Were it not for the purchase of oil from Mexico. we would. for all intents and purposes. have an equilibrium in trade between the United States and Mexico. But we do have in other countries a manufacturing job surplus. a manufacturing job surplus. right here in the United States. So we have a surplus. When we export. more jobs are created for those countries with which we have free trade agreements than with not.

1110029013,Mr. Speaker. I strongly oppose this substitute amendment offered by Mr. BUYER. The .bill before us. the WaxmanPlatts bill. has been carefully crafted over more than a decade. in close consultation with the public health community. Its been endorsed by over 1.000 different public health. scientific. medical. faith. and community organizations. It is also supported by a prestigious and bipartisan group of former public health officials. including former Secretaries of Health and Human Services.

It reflects a strong. reasonable. and comprehensive approach to addressing the tobacco epidemic. Now. this Buyer substitute is deeply flawed. It represents an inadequate response for the greatest preventable cause of death and disease in the United States. One of the biggest problems in this substitute is that it places oversight of tobacco under a totally new. untested agency. They create a new government agency that lacks any experience in protecting the public health. FDA is our Nations primary protector of the public health. and it has both the regulatory and scientific expertise to handle the complex task of regulating tobacco.

1110057810,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. my amendment is simple. It would cut spending in the bill across the board by onehalf of 1 percent. While this appropriations bill funds critical national priorities such as research at the National Institutes of Health. pandemic flu preparedness. and job training programs. the underlying bill provides $730.5 billion. making it the largest of 12 appropriations bills. The total is $59.4 billion. that is 9 percent. more than the regular fiscal year 2009 appropriations. and $1.9 billion more than that requested by the President. It also includes $163.4 billion in discretionary spending. which is $11.15 billion. or 7 percent. over last years level. I do not question the value of many of the programs funded by this bill. This bill funds programs that are critical to my district. like Impact AID. community health centers. the TRIO program. and nurse training and career technical education. but I offer this amendment because our Nation cannot continue on this path of deficit spending without serious. negative. longterm consequences. Among the various appropriations bills. this bill is typically the largest single source of discretionary funds for domestic Federal programs. It represents a 12.8 percent increase in spending over the level we were operating under in fiscal year 2008 less than 1 year ago.

1110034627,"Madam Speaker. I yield myself the balance of the time. We are standing here today doing something that is absolutely unnecessary. As I said in my opening remarks. why would we throw the rules out the window and have consideration of what is on occasion needed to rush through legislation. a sameday rule? The notion of a sameday rule undermines what was promised by candidate Obama. by Speaker PELOSr. and others in the Democratic leadership. and that is. that we would have a higher degree of deliberation. This conference report was. as I said. filed at 11:37 p.m. last night. some 15. 16 hours ago. We are in the midst of beginning the debate. and we are going to proceed to debate this. And now we have heard. in the last hour or so. that a decision was made that we will vote tomorrow. and that somehow will allow this to look as if its fair. Well. again. Madam Speaker. we are in the midst of debating a document which Members have not had an adequate enough time to see. Now. that aside. it is clear that the American people are hurting. I mentioned the fact that I just got back last night from Los Angeles. We have serious problems in our city. in our county. and in the State of California. We have serious problems all across this country. People are losing their homes. people are losing their jobs. And what we hear from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle is the finger of blame is pointed at George W. Bush. in large part because of deficit spending. And now. what was. as I said. inherited by President Obama from President Bush. yesand a Congress that has been controlled by Democrats for the last 2 yearsthey have inherited an economy which is facing serious problems. an economy that is clearly in recession. Madam Speaker. the solution is to do what economists across the board. Democrats and Republicans. not Republican political operatives. but many Democratic economists have said is not the right solution. My friend from St. Louis. Mr. AKIN. has come to quote the Treasury Secretary under Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Henry Morgenthau. who. in testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee. said. ""Weve tried spending money. Weve spent more money than weve ever spent before. Now. after 8 years of this Roosevelt administration. we have an unemployment rate that is just as high as when we started and an enormous debt to boot."" We know what the economic answer is to the challenges that we have. And I have regularly talked about it here. Madam Speaker. and that is. we need to take what has been promised by our friends on the other side of the aisle. but is totally ignored on a regular basis. and that is a bipartisan approach. And when I say a bipartisan approach. I believe we should take the ideas that were put forth by President John F. Kennedy in the early 1960s and Ronald Reagan in the early 1980s. and what we need to do. Madam Speaker. is we need to have a growthoriented tax rate reduction that will stimulate the economy and generate the kind of revenue flow that is needed. We need to pursue market opening opportunities for us around the world rather than sticking our head in the sand and ignoring things like the Colombia Free Trade Agreement and the South Korea Free Trade Agreement. That would go a long way towards creating jobs. good jobs right here in the United States of America if we can again pry open those markets. Those are the kinds of things we should be doing. And all we are getting. Madam Speaker. is a package that dramatically increases the size of the annual deficit and the national debt. Madam Speaker. in this budget. the deficit alone for the next year is larger than the entire budget was a mere 10 years ago. So Madam Speaker. I encourage my colleagues to work hard to get the economy back on track.

1110036311,Mr. President. today I am introducing legislation that would extend reasonable measures to protect access to longterm care hospitals. while ensuring that these institutions are admitting the appropriate type of patients. I am pleased to be introducing the bill along with my colleague. Senator HATCH. and I urge my colleagues to consider cosponsoring this costsaving proposal. Long Term Acute Care hospitals. or LTAC hospitals. serve a vital role in the Medicare program by providing care to beneficiaries. with clinically complex conditions that need hospital care for extended periods of time. I am happy to have two of these hospitals in North Dakota. one in Fargo and one in Mandan. They are a vital part of the North Dakota continuum of care. While these hospitals provide important health services to very frail individuals. the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. CMS. became concerned with the rapid growth in these facilities. and as a result began to arbitrarily cut LTAC hospital payments acrosstheboard. The Medicare. Medicaid and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007. MMSEA. enacted important changes that included the development of muchneeded patient and facility certification criteria to assure that the right patient is seen in the right postacute care setting. This law issued a moratorium on new facilities and expansions of older facilities and provided regulatory relief to protect patient access to LTAC hospitals while patient criteria are being developed. The legislation I am introducing today would extend these provisions by two years to provide stability to these hospitals and the patients they serve as CMS considers payment bundles and other changes in postacute care. As Chairman of the Budget Committee. I have a unique appreciation for the enormous fiscal challenges that face our coufitry and respect CMSs efforts to reduce growth in Medicare. We should address the growth in LTAC hospitals. but we also want to ensure that there is a place for patients who truly need longterm hospital stays. It was not easy for the LTAC hospitals in North Dakota and across the country to support legislation that restricts their payments. but I compliment them for working with me to put forward a constructive public policy proposal. Longterm care hospitals serve a vital role in our health care system. and we must protect access to these facilities for those who truly need it. But we can also take responsible steps to ensure that our federal tax dollars are well spent and directed to the most appropriate level of care. I believe my legislation achieves this balance and urge my colleagues to support this measure.,111116431,CONRAD,KENT,S,ND,M,D,,voting,2009-04-30,572,Mr. CONRAD,32114,32189,04302009.txt,2642,425,111,2009,mr presid today introduc legisl would extend reason measur protect access longterm care hospit ensur institut admit appropri type patient pleas introduc bill along colleagu senat hatch urg colleagu consid cosponsor costsav propos long term acut care hospit hospit serv vital role medicar program provid care beneficiari clinic complex condit need hospit care extend period time happi two hospit north dakota one fargo one mandan vital part north dakota continuum care hospit provid import health servic frail individu center medicar medicaid servic cm becam concern rapid growth facil result began arbitrarili cut hospit payment acrosstheboard medicar medicaid schip extens act enact import chang includ develop muchneed patient facil certif criteria assur right patient seen right postacut care set law issu moratorium new facil expans older facil provid regulatori relief protect patient access hospit patient criteria develop legisl introduc today would extend provis two year provid stabil hospit patient serv cm consid payment bundl chang postacut care chairman budget committe uniqu appreci enorm fiscal challeng face coufitri respect cmss effort reduc growth medicar address growth hospit also want ensur place patient truli need longterm hospit stay easi hospit north dakota across countri support legisl restrict payment compliment work put forward construct public polici propos longterm care hospit serv vital role health care system must protect access facil truli need also take respons step ensur feder tax dollar well spent direct appropri level care believ legisl achiev balanc urg colleagu support measur,246,FALSE
1110062964,"fornia. Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am pleased to support this resolution. Mr. Speaker. to accept the statue of Helen Keller presented by the people of the great State of Alabama. I come here today not to honor a mere statue of marble or stone. but to honor a woman of extraordinary courage. compassion and determination. Helen Keller was born June 27. 1880. in Tuscumbia. Alabama. During only the 19th month of her young life. Helen lost not only her sight but also her hearing during an apparent bout of meningitis. As many of us have seen in the awardwinning play and the movie ""The Miracle Worker."" at age 7. with the help of her gifted teacher. Anne Sullivan. Helen ascertained the ability to communicate. During her young life. she worked strenuously and tirelessly to overcome her sensory impediments and help others do the same. She attended the Perkins School for the Blind for 4 years. the Cambridge School for Young Ladies for 1. and Radcliffe College. a sister school to Harvard University. for 4 years. There she earned a bachelor of arts degree and graduated cum laude as our Nations first deaf and blind college graduate. Helen Keller worked tirelessly on behalf of her fellow men and women in this country and around the world: the blind. the deaf. the disabled. those seeking the right to vote. workers. and many others. A prolific author. one of her autobiographies. ""The Story of My Life."" has been translated into over 50 languages. She provided vital support to organizations such as the American Foundation for the Blind. and was justly given honorary degrees from Temple University. the University of Glasgow. the University of Delhi. the University of Berlin. and the University of Johannesburg. In 1964. President Lyndon Johnson awarded her the highest possible civilian award. the Presidential Medal of Freedom. She was also honored with Brazils Order of the Southern Cross. the Philippines Golden Heart. and Japans Sacred Treasure. In 1991. she was named by LIFE magazine as one of the 100 most important Americans of the 20th century. Helen Keller will be the first person with disabilities enshrined here in our Nations Capitol. This honor is long overdue. She was and is an inspiration to all of us regardless of our age. status. ethnicity. or background. To marvel at the dignity and beauty inherent in all human beings. to use the gifts and attributes that each of us possess to their full potential. to help our fellow citizens and human beings meet and overcome whatever fears. challenges and adversity they may face. these are the legacies of Helen Keller that will be so richly preserved by this statue in her honor. During this time of important challenges in our country and at all times in which human beings embark and journey on the road of life. Helen Keller reminds us that ""Although the world is full of suffering. it is full also of the overcoming of it"" and ""No pessimist ever discovered the secret of the stars or sailed an uncharted land. or opened a new doorway for the human spirit.""

1110013922,"Mr. Speaker. I would like to highlight one component of the socalled stimulus package that is particularly egregious. There is a pile of money for grants for ""pretrial release and pretrial release agencies"" in the stimulus. This is an unacceptable use of taxpayer dollars. Why? Because this program is a criminal bailout. Expanding the budgets of taxpayerfunded pretrial release programs is fiscally irresponsible when the private surety bail industry can be utilized to a greater degree with no expense to taxpayers. In fact. this provision not only puts taxpayers on the hook for bailing out criminals. it also would squeeze out privatesector solutions. in effect. killing jobs. So much for job creation.

1110026394,"Mr. President. I have sought recognition to introduce legislation to further expand the home buyer tax credit. A robust home buyer tax credit will spur consumer demand and help to stop the fall in home values. which continues to affect millions of Americans. This decline is destroying the savings and net worth of Americans. whose homes are their most valuable asset. Many now have mortgages that exceed the value of their homes. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 created a tax credit for firsttime home buyers of $7.500 through June of 2009. However. taxpayers were required to repay the tax credit in equal installments over 15 years. which greatly reduced its effectiveness. The 2009 Stimulus bill waived the repayment requirement for purchases -made in 2009. increased the value of the credit to $8.000. and extended eligibility for purchases made through November of 2009. Further improvements are necessary. in my judgment. to bring about a recovery in the housing market that will ultimately contribute to the turnaround of the broader economy. First. this bill would amend the Stimulus bill and raise the value to $15.000. or 10 percent of the value of the home. whichever is less. Second. this bill would make the home buyer tax credit available to any individual who purchases a home. not just firsttime home buyers. Doing so would stimulate demand for the entire range of homes on the market. Finally. this bill would remove the income eligibility threshold. Again. doing so would stimulate demand for the entire range of homes on the market. Currently. the credit is reduced for individuals with modified - adjusted gross income. AGI. of more than $75.000. $150.000 for joint filers. and is zero for those individuals with modified AGI in excess of $95.000. $170.000 for joint filers. The need for a robust home buyer tax credit is clear. According to the National Association of Realtors. pending home sales hit a record low in January 2009. The Pending Home Sales Index. which measures the number of sales contracts signed each month. fell 7.7 percent to 80.4. the lowest mark since 2001 when tracking began. At the same time. the housing affordability index rose 13.6 percentage points to a record high of 166.8. A value of 100 means that a family with the countrys median income has exactly enough income to qualify for a mortgage on a medianpriced existing singlefamily home. The higher the index. the better housing affordability is for buyers. These two figures. taken together. demonstrate that a robust home buyer tax credit is needed to spur demand from Americans that are hesitant to buy homes for fear that prices will not stabilize. Recent reports indicate a 13month supply of unsold new homes. compared with a 4month supply under more normal circumstances. Add to that a continually increasing number of foreclosed homes. According to the RealtyTrac 2008 YearEnd Foreclosure Market Report. a total of 3.2 million foreclosure filings--default notices. auction sale notices and bank repossessionswere reported on 2.3 million U.S. properties during 2008. an 81 percent increase in total properties from 2007 and a 225 percent increase in total properties from 2006. Jobs across all industries have been lost as a result of the housing crisis. According to a March 2. 2009. oped in the Washington Post by Robert J. Samuelson. ""Since late 2007. housingrelated jobscarpenters. real .estate agents. appraisershave dropped by 1 million. a quarter of all lost jobs."" I applaud the efforts of Senator JOHNNY ISAKSON. who has been the leader on this issue in the Senate. I cosponsored his legislation in the 110th Congress to create a home buyer tax credit. In the 111th Congress. I supported his amendment to the Stimulus bill to make improvements to the credit and I have decided to join him as a cosponsor of S. 253. which seeks to make further improvements. The bill I am introducing is different from S. 253 in three main ways. First. my bill would improve the home buyer credit using the 2009 Stimulus bill as a starting point. Second. my bill would increase the value of the credit to $15.000. or 10 percent of the home value. whichever is less. whereas S. 253 would increase the credit amount to 10 percent of the home price capped at 3.5 percent of Federal Housing Administration loan limits. These limits are geographically dependent and would yield a credit ranging between approximately $10.000 and $22.000. Finally. my bill would remove income limitations on the credit. whereas S. 253 limits the credit for individuals earning up to $125.000. or $250.000 in the case of a joint return. I believe it is important for both bills to be pending so that additional ideas can be debated. To that end. I look forward to working with Senator ISAKSON to build consensus and support for further improyements. As long as forecasts predict that home prices are falling and that the economy will remain weak. a large fraction of potential homebuyers may choose to remain on the sidelines without a robust tax credit in place. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. or the legislation introduced by Senator ISAKSON. to make further improvements to the home buyer tax credit.

1110074333,If I might. through the Chair. Mr. President. ask a question of the Senator from Tennessee. if he will yield. because he is absolutely right. This is being rushed. This is a massive reordering and restructuring of onesixth of our economy. which we are going to be expected to vote upon in just a few days. on a managers amendment which will be the socalled latest deal struck behind closed doors. as the Senator mentioned. We are going to be expected to vote upon that without having seen it today. In fact. I dont think any of our colleagues on the other side. or very few of them. have seen it. nor have the American people. I have listened as the other side has gotten up here today with all these statements of outrage and that it is insulting. it is unconscionable that this side would be holding up funding for the troops. and what strikes me about that is the deadline for passing the appropriations bills is September 30. I think that feigned outrage is all about a bigger. grand sort of cynical plan at work here to try to push this health care bill through. But would the Senator from Tennessee be able to answer a question regarding this. The Defense appropriations bill passed the House last summer. It passed the Senate in October. I think October 6. So we are talking 8. 9. 10 weeks ago now. Clearly. the Democratic majoritys clock management is either very bad or this was part of some big. grand plan to push this thing to the very end and to jam this thing through. to try to set it up so that the health care bill could be passed right before the Christmas holiday without the American people having had an opportunity to see it. and the Defense appropriations bill. which carries a bunch of other unrelated items. would pass as well. Does it seem a little odd and coincidental to the Senator from Tennessee that you would be debating the Defense appropriations bill right now when it could have been done weeks ago. if not months ago?

1110009700,Mr. President. Today I introduce the Native Hawaiian. Government Reorganization Act of 2009. While this legislation is especially significant to Native Hawaiians. I introduce this measure for all the people of Hawaii. This bill authorizes a process to extend federal recognition to Hawaiis indigenous people for the purposes of a governmenttogovernment relationship with the United States. This benefits all the people of Hawaii. as they will now have a structured. formal process to come together to address many unresolved issues confronting our state and our residents. Unlike our Nations other indigenous people. the Federal policy of selfgovernance and selfdetermination has not been extended to Native Hawaiians. The bill addresses this need and establishes parity. It provides Native Hawaiians a formal opportunity to participate in making policy decisions and empowers them to interact at the State and Federal levels through a governmenttogovernment relationship. The legislation is consistent with federal and state law and allows Native Hawaiians to be treated the same way as our countrys other indigenous people. The United States has recognized and upheld a responsibility for the wellbeing of indigenous. native people. including Native Hawaiians. Congress has enacted more than 160 statutes to address the needs of Native Hawaiians. In 1993. I sponsored a measure. commonly known as the Apology Resolution that was enacted into law. The Resolution outlined the history prior to- andfollowing the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. including involvement in the overthrow by agents of the United States. Further. in the Resolution the United.States apologized for its involvement in the overthrow and committed itself to acknowledge the ramifications of the overthrow and support reconciliation efforts between the United States and the Native Hawaiian people. This was a historic declaration that has initiated a healing process. However. additional Congressional action is needed to continue this process. The legislation allows us to take the necessary next step in the reconciliation process. The bill does three things. First. it authorizes an office in the Department of the Interior to serve as a liaison between Native Hawaiians and the United States. Second. it forms an interagency task force chaired by the Departments of Justice and Interior. as well as composed of officials from federal agencies who currently administer programs and services impacting Native Hawaiians. Third. it authorizes a process for the reorganization of the Native Hawaiian government for the purposes of a federally recognized governmenttogovernment relationship. Once the Native Hawaiian government is recognized. the bill establishes an inclusive democratic negotiations process representing both Native Hawaiians and nonNative Hawaiians. There are many checks and balances in this process and any agreements reached will require implementing legislation at the State and Federal levels. This legislation is needed to address issues present in my home state. It is a reality that there are longstanding and unresolved issues resulting from the overthrow. Despite good faith efforts to address these issues. the lack of a governmenttogovernment relationship has limited progress. Building on the constitutionally sound and deliberate efforts of Congress and.the State of Hawaii. it is necessary that Native Hawaiians be able to reorganize a government and enter into discussions with the Federal and State governments. My bill would ensure there is a structured process by which Native Hawaiians and the people of Hawaii can come together. resolve such complicated issues. and move forward together as a State. The legislation I introduce today is identical to language passed by the House of Representatives in the 106th Congress. This bill is the product of five working groups the Hawaii Congressional Delegation created to assist with the drafting of this legislation. The working groups were composed of individuals from the Native Hawaiian community. elected officials from the State of Hawaii. representatives from federal agencies. Members of Congress. as well as leaders from Indian Country and experts in constitutional law. This ensured that all parties that had expertise and would work to implement the legislation had an opportunity to collectively and collaboratively participate in the drafting process. The Hawaii Congressional delegation has carefully considered the significant public input and Congressional oversight on this bill over the last 9 years. To date. there have been a total of 9 Congressional hearings. including 6 joint hearings held by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee and House Natural Resources Committee. 5 of which were held in Hawaii. From the beginning. the National Congress of American Indians and Alaska Federation of Natives have joined Native Hawaiians in their pursuit for federal recognition. In the 110th Congress. the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs explored the legal aspects 6f the bill where Hawaiis State Attorney General expressed his support and spoke to the constitutionality of this measure. In addition to the bipartisan support at the Federal and State level for the bill. national organizations such as the American Bar Association. Japanese American Citizens League. and National Indian Education Association have also urged Congress to pass legislation establishing a process to provide federal recognition to Native Hawaiians. It is clear this legislation is constitutional and provides a framework respectful of the needs of Native Hawaiians and nonNative Hawaiians.

1110016904,In response to the Senator from North Dakota. through the Chair. what has changed? To have the Republican leader come before us today and say: Well. this has not been on the Web site of the Senate for the requisite 5 days. when I mentioned it has been on the House Web site for 7 days. it has passed the House in its entirety. As the Senator from North Dakota indicated. it has been debated at length and passed unanimously. for the most partDemocrats and -Republicanswithout objection. voting for all the contents. And now there is objection from the Republican side of the aisle. The obvious question is. What has changed? What is different? Well. there is only one thing different. We have a new President. a new President and a new administration. facing an economic struggle. a President who is asking for help from both sides of the aisle that we should give. We need to work together. He was not successful in finding House Republicans to support him in the efforts for the stimulus package. Only a handful voted for this measure when it came up in the House on the Republican side. We are hoping that at least some will finally step forward on the Republican side to pass this bill to keep the Government operating. What good does it do for us to shortchange the Securities and Exchange Commission at this moment in history. when we all know our savings. our retirement investments. 401(k)s. IRAs. are in peril because of a descending stock market. where there is question about the confidence that consumers. investors have in this agency? I put additional funds in there. through my appropriation. to make certain we have the integrity which we deserve in this marketplace. the same for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Those who would argue. as Senator MCCAIN does in his continuing resolution amendment. that we do not need additional resources in these key agencies that protect investors and savers. they are just plain wrong. A vote for the McCain amendment is a vote to go back further to those days when these agencies were not up to the challenges they face. Some of that was conscious. where they ignored demands and warnings related to Mr. Madoff and others. Some was inadvertent in the CFTC. where they did not have the people and the equipment and the computers and the technology to follow these trades. How in the world can we. in good conscience. say we are not going to adequately fund these agencies. while millions of American families count on us to do that? They make the choice on investments.- They trust us to make certain those investments are transparent and there is accountability. I would say to my friend from North Dakota. when we went through this. month after month. week after week. day after day in the committee. we had bipartisan support all the way. Now that we have a new President of a different political party. the other side of the aisle is raising questionsquestions they did not raise for 8 months. Now they are being raised. That is unfortunate.

1110002797,"Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the managers amendment to H.R. 384. the ""TARP Reform and Accountability Act of 2009."" Let me begin by thanking the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Financial Services for his fine work on H.R. 384. as well as for his cooperation in the past in my efforts to ensure that TARP funds were made available to the domestic automotive industry. as well as to domestic automotive financing companies. I look forward to working with him in the future to see that TARP funds are properly allocated and their use and effectiveness be subject to impartial oversight by the Congress. As debate on the use of TARP funds has progressed. I have consistently maintained that recipients of those funds all be subject to uniform oversight requirements. It pleases me that the managers amendment to H.R. 384 includes additional public repoding requirements for entities that have .received or will receive TARP funds in the future. The question of oversight aside. I have also long maintained that the root of the Nations current economic crisis lies in the collapse of the housing market. Too little has been done in the past year to stabilize the market and help financially distressed homeowners. The managers amendment wisely addresses this problem by requiring that a specific portion of the next tranche of TARP funds be dedicated to mitigate foreclosures on residential mortgages within 7 days of enactment of H.R. 384. This is of particular importance and will hopefully be of great assistance to my State. Michigan. which unfortunately has one of the Nations highest foreclosure rates. While stabilizing the housing market is a large part of the solution to the current recession. I must reiterate my belief that the Congress should take action to support the domestic manufacturing industry. and in particular. our ailing automakers. I would note that foreign markets for automobiles are contracting. and other governments are contemplating or have already taken measures to help automakers with production facilities in their countries. A key partof the automotive. industrys troubles in the United States is the lack of credit available to consumers. The managers amendment retains H.R. 384s grant of authority to. the Treasury to provide support to the financing arms of automakers. which will in turn allow consumers and businesses access to previously unavailable lines of credit for the purchase of new vehiGles. I voice my wholehearted support for this sensible provision. especially as the collective future of our automakers is tied directly to the health of their financing arms. I would again thank the chairman for his gracious cooperation in the past on this and many other issues. The managers amendment contains prudent measures to improve oversight and administration of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. and I would urge my colleagues to support its passage. The Acting CHAIR.

1110003020,I cannot give the gentleman that assurance given the time frame that Mr. OBEY is on. Obviously. as you know. the President and I think in a bipartisan way this administration. without reference to the specific stimulus package or recovery and reinvestment package that were talking about. believes that we need to act with dispatch. We need to act carefully. We need to act correctly. But we also need to act with dispatch. I have just been told. by the way. that the text of the bill is online as we speak. So what I was going to say is that we need to act with dispatch. and as you can see. were apparently doing that. We have a crisis that confronts us. We have lost over 2.5 million jobs. We lost a million jobs in the last 2 months. People are hurting. We have and I know of you have a sense of urgency. We have worked with this administration to try to respond to the economic crisis that confronts us. Very frankly. Democrats worked in a very bipartisan way and a very supportive way with this President and the Secretary of Treasury in trying to respond to this crisis. As a matter of fact. I would suggest that Democrats were more responsive to the Presidents request and Secretary Paulsons request than some Members of his own party. But that aside. we believe we need to act. as I said. with dispatch. We are doing that. Im glad that this is online because now the committee will have Thursday. Friday. Saturday. Sunday. Monday. and Tuesday. Clearly while one may not be able to get into the Capitol. although I would be surprised if the Appropriations staff could not get in the Capitol. and I dont want to adopt that premise because I dont know that to be the case. but in any event. the text will be obviously available to anybody all over the country to look at. to comment on. and to be prepared to 7ct on at the appropriate time.

1110010541,"Mr. President. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee. I have had very little to do with this bill in the sense of writing it. I think most of us feel somewhat the same way. I am growing increasingly concerned about the bill. as to whether it is really going to be a stimulus. I come from a State which has more people unemployed today than the population of a dozen States. a State where the breadlines are growing. where the need for assistance is growing. where the State has a huge deficit. where counties are unable to fund their operhting maintenance. where all capital projects have stopped. and where the State is now furloughing employees. I think while we dither. Rome burns. This crisis is so multidimensional and the dominoes are falling so much more rapidly than any of us thought and they are pushed from so many different points. The fact is that people cannot get credit--credit for your big corporations to open a new hotel. credit. if you are a small employer. to pay your payroll. Credit remains frozen. The housing crisis continues to work its problems. What. in my view. a stimulus is not. candidly speaking. is a tax package. I do not believe in this economy tax cuts are stimulus. The current state of the package. as I understand it. is that tax cuts are roughly 40 percent of the package. 20 percent is local assistance. State and local assistance. 15 percent is safety.net spending. 15 percent is infrastructure spendingthat is alland 10 percent is other spending. I do not know how many jobs are going to come out of this because it is my belief that peoples buying patterns have changed. This morning. a number of my colleagues talked about a report from the Congressional Budget Office. and what they did not do is they did not quote from certain parts of it. I would like to quote on what they found. Here it is: A dollars worth of a temporary tax cut would have a smaller effect on GDP than a dollars worth of direct purchase or transfers. because a significant share of thd tax cut would probably be saved. As a matter of fact. we have evidence of that. Last year. we approved more than $130 billion in tax cuts. primarily through a $600perperson tax refund. After all of that money was spent in two tranches going out. there was little or no perceptible impact on the economy. But we do not learn. In fact. study after study shows that upper income taxpayers are less likely to spend the refund checks they receive than those with low incomes. According to a recent CRS analysis. tax cuts are likely- to have a ""diminished stimulus effect.""",111118161,FEINSTEIN,DIANNE,S,CA,F,D,,voting,2009-02-06,220,Mrs. FEINSTEIN,6966,7037,02062009.txt,2594,464,111,2009,mr presid thank distinguish chairman financ committe littl bill sens write think us feel somewhat way grow increasingli concern bill whether realli go stimulu come state peopl unemploy today popul dozen state state grow need assist grow state huge deficit counti unabl fund mainten capit project stop state furlough employe think dither rome burn crisi multidimension domino fall much rapidli us thought push mani differ point fact peopl get big corpor open new hotel credit small employ pay payrol credit remain frozen hous crisi continu work problem view stimulu candidli speak tax packag believ economi tax cut stimulu current state packag understand tax cut roughli percent packag percent local assist state local assist percent safetynet spend percent infrastructur spendingthat alland percent spend know mani job go come belief peopl buy pattern chang morn number colleagu talk report congression budget offic quot certain part would like quot found dollar worth temporari tax cut would smaller effect gdp dollar worth direct purchas transfer signific share thd tax cut would probabl save matter fact evid last year approv billion tax cut primarili perperson tax refund money spent two tranch go littl percept impact economi learn fact studi studi show upper incom taxpay less like spend refund check receiv low incom accord recent cr analysi tax cut like diminish stimulu effect,220,FALSE
1110019879,"Madam President. I rise to speak about the nomination of David Ogden to be Deputy Attorney General of the Department of Justice. To summarize what I see in the RECORD. what I have reaal. I am very disappointed in the Obama administration for nominating this individual who is obviously talented but has also obviously chosen to represent. sometimes on a pro bono basis. groups that push pornography. He even represented interests against child pornography laws that we have passed by unanimous votes in the Senate. Here is a gentleman who has taken up these causes as a lawyer. I appreciate his skill and ability as a lawyer. I appreciate his willingness to represent a client. But he has chosen to consistently represent pornography companies and groups.- Even against the unanimous opinion of this body on child pornography cases. he has taken the other side. The message that sends across the country to peoplewhen we are struggling with a huge wave of pornography. and then. at the worst end of it. child pornographythe message it sends around the rest of the country is this is a Justice Department that is not going to enforce these child por-. nography laws or is not concerned about this. when we have an epidemic wave of pornography. and particularly of child pornography. that is striking across the United States. and that this is harming our children. It is harming our society overall. Now. at the second to the top place of enforcement. you are putting your Deputy Attorney General who has taken on these 6ases. and sometimes in a pro bono manner. I have no doubt of his legal skills. But the message this sends across the country to parents. who are struggling to raise kids. is not a good one. Our office has been receiving all sorts of calls opposed to Mr. Ogdens nomination because of that very featureand deeply concerned calls because they are struggling within their own families to try to raise kids. to try to raise kids responsibly. and to try to raise them in a culture that oftentimes is very difficult with the amount of violent material. sexual material that is out there. and hoping their Government can kind of back them a little bit and say: These things are wrong. Child pornography is wrong. It should not take place. It should not be on the Internet. And you should not participate in it. Instead. to then nominate somebody who has represented groups supporting that dispirits a number of parents and says: Is not even my Government and its enforcement arms going to take this on? Are they not going to be concerned about this. as I am concerned about it as a parent? I see it pop up on the Internet. on the screen. at our home way too often. and I do not want to see this continue to take place. Then along comes this nominee. who knocks the legs out from under a number of parents. I want to give one quick fact on this that startled me when I was looking at it. It is about the infiltration of pornography into the popular culture. and particularly directly into our homes. and now it is an issue that all families grapple with. our family has grappled with. My wife and I have five children. Three of them are out of the household now. We still have two of them at home. We grapple and wrestle with this. Once relatively difficult to procure. pornography is now so pervasive that it is freely discussed on popular. primetime television shows. The statistics on the number of children who have been exposed to pornography are alarming. A recent study found that 34 percent of adolescents reported being exposed to unwantedthis is even unsolicited. unwantedsexual content online. a figure that. sadly. had risen 9 percent over the last 5 years. Madam President. 9 out of 10 children between the ages of 8 and 16 who have Internet access have viewed porn Web sites9 out of 10 children between the ages of 8 and 16 who have Internet access have viewed porn Web sitesusually in the course of looking up information for homework. It is a very addictive situation we have today. I -held a hearing several years back about the addictiveness of pornography. and we had experts in testifying that this is now the most addictive.sustance out in the U.S. society today because once it gets into your head. you cannot like dry off or dry out of it. The situation is alarming on its impact on marriages. There is strong evidence that marriages are also adversely affected by addiction to sexually addictive materials. At a past meeting of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers. twothirds of the divorce lawyers who attended said that excessive interest in online pornography played a significant role in divorces in the previous year. That is twothirds of the divorce lawyers saying this is getting to be a situation that is impacting so many of our clients and is so pervasive. While David Ogden possesses impressive academic credentials. and he certainly is a talented lawyer. he has also represented several clients. significant clients. with views far outside the mainstream. and he has not. to my satisfaction. disavowed the views of these clients. He was given every chance to in hearings. He was trying to be pinned down by people on the committee about: What are your views? I understand your clients views. What are your views? And he would not respond to those. He said: Well. these are views of my clients. I understand the views of your clients. If they are pushing pornography. child pornography. want to have access to this. I understand that. What are your views? And he demurred each time and would not respond clearly. Based on that record. I am led to believe it is highly likely David Ogden may share the views of some of his clientsof those who have supported pornographyand I cannot trust him to enforce some of our Nations most important antichild pornography lawslaws that he has a history of arguing are unconstitutional. That is a position he took as a lawyer: that these are unconstitutional. antichild pornography laws. In an amicus brief David Ogden filed in United States v. American Library Association. he argued that the Childrens Internet Protection Act. which requires libraries receiving Federal funds to protect children from online pornography on library computers. censored constitutionally protected material and that Congress was violating the first amendment rights of library patrons. Now. that was the position David Ogden took. In a response to written questions submitted by Senator GRASSLEY after his confirmation hearing. David Ogden indicated he served as pro bono counselfor people who are not lawyers. that means he did it for freein this case. further calling into question his personal views. If you are willing to represent a client for free. it seems to me there is some discussion or possibility you may really share your clients views on this issue regarding access to online pornography at libraries. The Childrens Internet Protection Act passed this body. the Senate. by a vote of 95 to 3 back in 2000. Ninetyfive Members of this body believed the Childrens Internet Protection Act was an appropriate measure to protect children from Internet filth and was constitutional because our duty. as well. is to stand for the Constitution and to abide by the Constitution and uphold it. How can we trust David Ogden to enforce this law when he argued against it as a pro bono counsel? In another very disturbing case. Knox v. the United States. in which Stephen Knox was charged and convicted for violating antichild pornography lawsthese are child pornography laws but child pornography laws which I think are in another thoroughly disgusting categoryDavid Ogden filed a brief on behalf of the ACLU and.others challenging the Federal child pornography statutes. At issue in this case was how child pornography is defined under the Federal statutes. I am sure many of my colleagues will remember the controversy that surrounded this case. As iou may recall. Stephen Knox was prosecuted by the Bush Justice Departmentduring the first Bush Presidencyand ultimately convicted. after U.S. Customs intercepted foreign videotapes he had ordered. By the time his conviction was appealed. however. President Clinton was in office. and the Justice Department changed its position on Knoxs conviction. Drew Days. Clintons Solicitor General at the time. chose not to defend the conviction of Knox. The Clinton Justice Department said: Yes. he is convicted. but we are not going to prosecute this. But the Senate. by a vote of 100 to 0which is really rare to get around this placeand the House. by a vote of 425 to.3. rejected the Clinton Justice Departments interpretation of the child porn laws. The Senate unanimously said: Prosecute this. Prosecute this child pornography case. David Ogden was on the wrong side of this case. I urge my colleagues to consider whether a man who has taken such extreme positions on pornography. and especially child pornography. can be trusted to enforce Federal laws prohibiting this cultural toxic waste. I am not convinced that David Ogden does not share the views he advocated in the Knox case. and I am concerned that at the very least he may be sympathetic to the views of his former clients. I hope David Ogden proves me wrong and he demonstrates a strong willingness to enforce Federal child- pornography and obscenity laws. These laws are on the books. I hope he enforces them. But I cannot in good conscience vote in favor of his nomination given his past record and the positions he has taken. His past positions have been far too extreme and outside of the mainstream for me. or I think for most Americans. and certainly for most parents. to be able to support him to be No. 2 in command of the Justice Department that enforces these laws. I realize many of my colleagues. and likely the majority. are going to cast their votes in favor of David Ogden. Before they do. I ask them to please consider the negative impact pornography has hadand particularly child pornography has hadon this society and the important role the Justice -Department plays in protecting children from obscene and pornographic material. particularly child pornography. The infiltration of pornography into our popular culture and our homes is an issue that every family now grapples with. Once relatively difficult to procure. it is now so pervasive that it is freely discussed all over. Pornography has become both pervasive and intrusive in print and especially on the Internet. Lamentably. pornography is now also a multibilliondollarayear industry. While sexually explicit material is often talked about in terms of ""free speech."" too little has been said about its devastating effects on users and their families. According to many legal scholars. one reason for the industrys growth is a legal regime that has undermined the whole notion that illegal obscenity can be prosecuted. The Federal judiciary continues to challenge our ability to protect our families and our children from gratuitous pornographic images. and we must have a Justice Department that is committed to combating this most extreme form of pornography. Perhaps the ugliest aspect of the pornographic epidemic is child pornography. This is where Mr. Ogdens record is most disturbing because he is outside of even the minimal consensus on pornographic prosecutions that exist. Children* as young as 5 years old are being used for profit in this. regrettably. fastgrowing industry. While there has been very little consensuson the prosecution of even the most hardcore adult pornography. there has been widespread agreement on the necessity of going after the purveyors of child porn. Despite this agreement. this exploitive industry continues to thrive. Every day. there are approximately 116.000 online searches for child pornography116.000. I think we can all agree that we have a duty to protect the weakest members of our society from exploitation and from abuse. I fear David Ogden will be a step backwardand certainly sends that signal across our society and to our parents and our families in this effort to combat this most dangerous form of pornography. For those reasons. I will be casting a ""no"" vote on his confirmation. Madam President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.",111114011,BROWNBACK,SAMUEL,S,KS,M,R,,voting,2009-03-11,93,Mr. BROWNBACK,4750,5107,03112009.txt,12268,2065,111,2009,madam presid rise speak nomin david ogden deputi

To respect the efforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts. I am submitting every email sent to me through an address set up specifically for this purpose to the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. This is not an issue that will be easily resolved. but it is one that deserves immediate and serious attention. and Idahoans deserve to be heard.

1110035513,"Mr. Chairman. I was listening very carefully to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. and. again. I want to say I believe every person in this Chamber would agree that there are misleading and deceptive practices with credit card companies. I have congratulated the gentlelady from New York for that title in her bill that would provide effective disclosure. Consumers need it. they demand it. and they are not receiving it. But in taking one step forward. her legislation. unfortunately. probably takes 10 steps backwards. And ultimately what is unfair. what is unfair. Mr. Chairman. is in a time of a credit contraction to reach into peoples wallets and take their credit cards away. Ultimately. that is what this legislation will do. Regardless of its noble intentions. that is what the legislation will do. It is not j4st theory I have. It is history. We have seen similar legislation enacted in Great Britain. and that was the impact. Now. I have heard in the context of the debate on the budget colleague after colleague on the Democratic side of the aisle decry budget deficits. ""The budget deficit is horrible."" Well. it was $160 billion when they took it over. and now it is going to $1.8 trillion. They increased it 10fold. Now I hear Democratic colleague after Democratic colleague lament the credit contraction. Yes. there is a credit contraction. Why do you want to worsen it? Why do you want to exacerbate it? And when you engage in forms of price controls. and you may come up with all kinds of different names for it. but if you are going to restrict fees for people who pay their bills latethey need to be disclosed. people need an opportunity to pay off their billsbut ultimately in a free market. people ought to have consumer choice and they ought to be able even with a checkered credit past to get credit. People are counting on these credit cards. Riskbased pricing. You are tak""ing tools away from those who use it and you are leading to two consequences. Either. number one. half of America is paying their bill on time and you are going to force them through this legislation to bail out the portion of America that doesnt. and for those who are struggling. you are going to deny them credit card options. People need these credit cards for their small business. They need it for personal items. I hear from the people in my district. I hear from the Vehon family of Rowlett. who said. ""We were laid off from our jobs at the same time."" the gentleman talking about himself and his wife. ""We moved into our first home together in July of that year. Needless to say. the layoff was quite a shock. and without access to our credit cards at the time. frankly. I dont know what we would have done."" And yet the legislation before us could take away the credit cards of the Vehon family of Rowlett. I heard from the Howard family of Canton. ""My wife and I use our credit cards. at times. to pay for medicalrelated bills. My wife has a heart condition. which between her medical bills and mine we spend outofpocket $18.000. And yes we had to put some of that cost on credit cards."" I heard from the Juarez family in Mesquite. ""I oppose this legislation. I have utilized my credit cards to pay for some costly oral surgeries. I dont want to get penalized by this legislation for making my payments on time."" Lets not penalize the people that are doing it right. Lets not penalize the people who desperately need credit in a credit contraction. We need disclosure. We need adequate time to pay off bills.

1110071872,If the Senator will yield. I was listening to him talk about this bill being fundamentally flawed. which it is. I think back about the comments Senator MCCONNELL said on the floor. and I think ORRIN HATCH. from Utah. the other day expanded on it. Anything that is this major. this major of a reform that we are going to live with for generations. should be done in a bipartisan way. I know Senator HATCH talked about the fact that something of this size should have 70 votes. to pass a bill that will stand the test of time. Earlier today I heard a friend on the other side of the aisle talk about the fact that Republicans walked away. I dont look at it that way. But I remember very early on when we saw the basic. fundamental building blocks of this bill. almost every Republican Senator wrote a letter to Senator REID. our majority leader. and told him if there were going to be Medicare cuts that were used to leverage a whole new entitlement. we could not support the bill. So what did the majority leader and the finance chairman. MAX BAUCus. do? They used that as one of the fundamental building blocks of this bill. That is paying for 50 percent of this billtaking Medicare cuts. a program that is insolvent. and using it to leverage a new program. What I would sayand I see the leader here on the floorI agree a bill of this size has to have bipartisan support. I dont know how you get bipartisan support. though. when almost everyone in our caucus wrote a letter in the very preliminary stages of negotiation to let them know that we considered that to be a fundamental flaw. we considered that not to pass the commonsense test.

1110033956,Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker. I rise -today in support of House Resolution 337. which increases awareness of child maltreatment and urges communities to support children and families. Every April. the President issues a: proclamation for National Child Abuse Prevention Month. and at the same time. he releases the previous years data on child abuse and neglect. Last years data was very unsettling. In 2007. State and local child protective services investigated nearly 5.8 million cases of child abuse or neglect. Out of these cases. protective services confirmed that 794.000 children were victims of maltreatment in 2007. Of the nearly 800.000 cases in 2007. 59 percent of them were classified as child neglect. 4.2 percent of casep involved psychological mistreatment. 7.6 percent involved sexual abuse. 10.8 percent of the victims suffered physical abuse. and 13.1 percent of the children suffered from multiple mistreatments. The reports of child deaths from abuse and neglect are even more startling. An estimated 1.760 children died in 2007 as a result of abuse and neglect. Of these children who died. a disturbing 75 percent were under the age of four. Over half of the child fatalities were a. year or younger. These statistics. of course. are only cases of child maltreatment which have been reported to police or social services. This month is a time not only to spread awareness of maltreatment. but also to recognize those organizations dedicated to preventing child abuse and neglect. I would like to thank Representative GRANGER for bringing this bill to the floor. I urge my colleagues to take this serious issue into consideration and to support this measure and set aside time to create awareness of child maltreatment.

1110039664,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of H. Res. 171. which calls for constitutional reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as sustained American engagement in partnership with the European Union. In the 13 years since the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords.brought an end to a brutal conflict. the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina have worked closely with the international community to make considerable progress in building a peaceful and democratic society that is built upon the rule of law. respect for human rights. and a free market economy. Within the last year. the country has taken important steps along the path to EuroAtlantic integration. beginning an intensified dialogue with NATO and signing a Stabilization and Association Agreement with the European Union. Notwithstanding these notable milestones. there are troubling signs of backsliding as political rhetoric grows confrontational. reforms unravel. and ethnic tensions increase. Bosnia seemingly faces the prospect of stagnation at best. and a return to violent conflict at worst. While Bosnias future clearly lies in the EuroAtlantic community. the country must first develop an efficient and effective state with functioning institutions that are capable of making selfsustaining reforms and managing the responsibilities of - EU and NATO membership. H. Res. 171 does not prescribe the types of constitutional reforms that are required. Indeed. such decisions can only be made by the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina. However. the United States and the European Union can help create conditions that are conducive to efforts by Bosnian -citizens to develop a functional political system. First. the Peace Implementation Council should remain firm in its commitment to maintain the Office of the High Representative until Bosnia has definitively met the five conditions and two principles. Only then should the office be closed and responsibility transitioned to the EU Special Representative. The recent dialogue among some political leaders that led to the adoption of an agreement on the status of Broko District was a helpful development. Hopefully. similar progress can be made on state property and other issues. Second. the European Union should. provide Bosnia with a clear set of EU - candidacy and membership conditions. These should include explicit and objective benchmarks regarding constitutional reforms that will increase the functionality of the Bosnian state. The EU should also carefully reconsider its plans for the drawdown or redeployment of its 2.500 European Union force. as the continued presence of those troops deters violence and provides citizens with a psychological reassurance of security. And. finally. there is a need for sustained. highlevel U.S. engagement with the EU on the development and implementation of common policies that will stabilize and strengthen Bosnia and Herzegovina. H. Res. L71 advocates the appointment of a Special Envoy for the Balkans which would signal American commitment to the region. In addition to working directly with political leaders on the.ground. this official could seek to develop a consensus among the EU and its member states about the way forward in southeastern Europe. The visit by Vice President BIDEN to Bosnia. Serbia. and Kosovo next week is an encouraging sign of renewed American interest in the Balkans. As he and other senior officials in the Obama administration were personally involved in efforts to establish peace in the Balkans 13 years ago. they know firsthand the importance of preserving this hardwon stability and the considerable cost of letting it slip away. Although the United States and the European Union are consumed by other foreign policy priorities. we must not lose sight of our unfinished business in the Balkans or waiver from our commitment to consolidating peaceful progress across Europe. I strongly support this resolution. I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.,111116630,BERMAN,HOWARD,H,CA,M,D,28,voting,2009-05-12,421,Mr. BERMAN,22152,22267,05122009.txt,4040,630,111,2009,mr speaker yield time may consum rise strong support re call constitut reform bosnia herzegovina well sustain american engag partnership european union year sinc sign dayton peac end brutal conflict peopl bosnia herzegovina work close intern commun make consider progress build peac democrat societi built upon rule law respect human right free market economi within last year countri taken import step along path euroatlant integr begin intensifi dialogu nato sign stabil associ agreement european union notwithstand notabl mileston troubl sign backslid polit rhetor grow confront reform unravel ethnic tension increas bosnia seemingli face prospect stagnat best return violent conflict worst bosnia futur clearli lie euroatlant commun countri must first develop effici effect state function institut capabl make selfsustain reform manag respons eu nato membership re prescrib type constitut reform requir inde decis made peopl bosnia herzegovina howev unit state european union help creat condit conduc effort bosnian citizen develop function polit system first peac implement council remain firm commit maintain offic high repres bosnia definit met five condit two principl offic close respons transit eu special repres recent dialogu among polit leader led adopt agreement statu district help develop hope similar progress made state properti issu second european union provid bosnia clear set eu candidaci membership condit includ explicit object benchmark regard constitut reform increas function bosnian state eu also care reconsid plan drawdown redeploy european union forc continu presenc troop deter violenc provid citizen psycholog reassur secur final need sustain highlevel us engag eu develop implement common polici stabil strengthen bosnia herzegovina re advoc appoint special envoy balkan would signal american commit region addit work directli polit leader theground offici could seek develop consensu among eu member state way forward southeastern europ visit vice presid biden bosnia serbia kosovo next week encourag sign renew american interest balkan senior offici obama administr person involv effort establish peac balkan year ago know firsthand import preserv hardwon stabil consider cost let slip away although unit state european union consum foreign polici prioriti must lose sight unfinish busi balkan waiver commit consolid peac progress across europ strongli support resolut urg colleagu mr speaker reserv balanc time,359,FALSE

1110073117,I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I had hoped that the gentleman would rise and explain what he just explained. Now. I will gladly yield to him to explain why this would only apply to earmarks by House Members alone and why the competition requirements dont apply to earmarks that are jointly requested by a House and Senate Member. If were hanging our hat on language that requires that these earmarks be subject to competition. then surely we would extend it to anything that had our name on it. but were not. My understanding is that the language only applies to those earmarks that are requested solely by a House Member. and that if you have a Senate Member on your earmark request. then it is not subject to competition. The language just explained does not apply to it. So you cant have it both ways. Now. I will argue that it doesnt matter anyway. because right now if you talk to the Department of Defense. and I have. weve held meetings in my office with the procurement officials. and weve asked them. How does this work when these earmarks come over? Are they subject to competition? They said. Yes. we follow the rules. Yet when you ask them to do a cursory examination or a fullfledged examination of those earmarks that were requested in prior years. you will find an uncanny alignment. as you might expect. between the intended recipient and those who actually got the earmarks in the end. So you can say until youre blue in the face were going to subject these to full and open competition. The Department of Defense already says that. And these articles that I already talked about. these scandals that are currently underway are under a policy where the Department of Defense already says we subject these to full and open competition. But let me tell you. if an earmark comes over from a Member of Congress. particularly from those on the Appropriations Committeeand I should explain that the majority of these earmarks. a disproportionate number. are from the powerful Members on the Appropriations Committeebelieve me. those procurement officials at the Department of Defense take that into account. They know who butters their bread. and they know that theyd better award this contract to the intended recipient or they might not get funded the next year. If thats not the case. why have we seen so much an uncanny alignment between the intended recipient and those who actually got the earmark in the first place? So. first. again let me say if were hanging our hat on the language that says these are subject to competition. then why wouldnt we apply it to every earmark that is contained in this bill? It doesnt apply to Senate earmarks. nor does it apply to earmarks requested by both Senate and House Members. So are we saying. well. were going to subject some to competition and that means something. but these others. yes. its okay if there are nobid contracts?

Part of the Progressive vision is doing things together which we should and could do together. and doing things separately. then maybe we get to make that call on our own. Maybe we should make sure that all Americans have health care. that everyone is safe. that women dont have to live In a home where they fear battering. and that we have a criminal justice system that protects them from that.

1110018718,"Madam Speaker. today. March 6. is an important day in not only Texass history but American history because this is the day that the Alamo fell with 187 volunteers from all States in the United States and numerous foreign countries. Even though all of the defenders of the Alamo were killed. ten times that number was killed on the enemy side. the invading Mexican army. March 2. earlier this week. was the day that Texas declared independence from Mexico. And during that final successful battle at San Jacinto. Texas gained independence and was a free and independent nation for over 9 years. There are many Texas heroes. remembering. of course. they came from all over the world. at the Alamo. Weve heard about William Barret Travis. the commander. Davy Crockett. Jim Bowie. We later hear about Sam Houston at the battle of San Jacinto. But we often dont remember a person by the name of James Butler Bonham. A 29yearold. he was from the University of South Carolina. grew up in Red Bank. South Carolina. He was a boyhood friend of William Barret Travis. And it was his job. along with Juan Seguin. to try to seek out reinforcements to the Alamo. He would break through enemy lines numerous times to try to bring people to come in aid at the Alamo. He was successful in bringing 32 men from Gonzales. He breaks through the lines his final time. goes to WashingtonontheBrazos to try to get more recruits. They refused to go because they were trying to build a government. And when he left that time on March 3. he made the report that ""I will report back to my friend William Barret Travis or die in the attempt that no one is coming."" He broke through the enemy lines one last time. and 3 days later. he and the other 186 defenders of the Alamo gave the ultimate sacrifice for freedom.

1110017106,Mr. President. today I rise to introduce the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act. When I introduced this bill in the last Congress. we were in the middle of one of the largest foodborne illness outbreaks in the history of our country. Nearly 1500 people fell sick last spring and summer because of Salmonella Saintpaul. leading to a Government investigation that pointed the finger first at tomatoes and then at jalapeno peppers in Texas before settling on Serrano peppers in Mexico. In the meantime. more people got sick and the tomato industry lost up to hundreds of millions of dollars. Less than a year later. we find ourselves in the middle of yet another nationwide outbreak: peanut butter tainted with Salmonella. the second case of its kind in 2 years. There is not a day that goes by that we dont hear about another recalled peanut butter product or another person sick with Salmonella. More than 660 people have been sickened. half of them children. At least nine people are dead. Over 2.600 products have been recalled. in a recall that goes back to March 2005 and could continue for at least another couple of years. making this one of the biggest food recalls in our Nations history. Unfortunately. these problems seem to be par for the course. In the last couple of years we have seen Salmonella in our peppers and peanut butter and E. coli in our spinach. Our food safety problems do not just start and stop at home: we have also seen chemically tainted pet food. milk products. and seafood from China. These problems are only the tip of the iceberg. Every year. more than 76 million Americans become sick because of a foodborne illness. 325.000 are hospitalized. and 5.000 die. It is clear that the Food and Drug Administration. who regulates these foods and 80 percent of our food supply. including virtually all food imports. can not keep up. The agency is underfunded and overwhelmed. It operates under an obsolete. largely reactive 1938 law. Its food safety program has not kept up with the dramatic changes in our food system. and it does a poor job of preventing and responding to food safety problems. As a result. consumers suffer and so do businesses something we can never afford. but especially in these trying economic times. Our food safety system is in crisis and it is time that we act. Thats why Senator GREGG and I are introducing the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act. a bipartisan bill that gives the FDA the new authorities and resources it needs to stop food safety problems before they start. For the first time in history. our bill gives the FDA a mandate to inspect: to increase the inspections at all food facilities. including annual inspections of high risk facilities. It requires the food industry to have in place plans that address identified hazards with the right preventive measures. It requires all testing and sampling for regulatory purposes to be done by labs accredited by the FDA. and requires those results to be sent to the agency. It also enables the FDA to more effectively respond to an outbreak by giving the agency new authorities to order recalls. shut down tainted facilities. and access records. This bill is proof that food safety is not a Democratic issue or a Republican one. Everyone eats. All Americans have a right to know that the food we buy for our families and our pets is safe. We should not have to worry about getting sick. or worse. If theres a problem. our Government should be able to catch it and fix it before people die. I thank Senators KENNEDY. DODD. KLOBUCHAR. BURR. ALEXANDER. and CHAMBLISS for joining me in this effort. I also want to thank the consumer. public health. and industry groups who have helped us craft a strong bill for their support: Consumer Federation of America. Center for Science in the Public Interest. Consumers Union. Trust for Americas Health. Grocery Manufacturers of America. American Feed- Industry Association. American Frozen Food Institute. Food Marketing Institute. National Fisheries Institute. and American Spice Trade Association. This bill is a comprehensive. bipartisan effort that improves the FDAs ability to prevent. detect. and respond to food safety problems. whether this means Salmonellatainted peanut butter from Georgia or melaminespiked candy from China. Its the first step towards building a food safety system that is science and riskbased. accountable to consumers. more transparent. and focused on prevention.

1110045226,"Madam Speaker. I rise today as the proud sponsor of H.R. 2090. which would designate the Ogdensburg. New York post office in honor of renowned 19thcentury American sculptor. painter. author and illustrator Frederic Remington. I want to thank the Gentleman from New York (Mr. T6WNS) and the Gentleman from California for their work to bring this legislation to the floor today. I also want to thank the members of the New York delegation for cosponsoring this measure along with Representative CHAFFETZ. Ranking Member of the House Subcommittee on Federal Workforce. Postal Service. and the District of Columbia. Frederic Remington was born in Canton. New York. in 1861 and moved to Ogdensburg. New York in 1873. Best known for his depictions of frontier life of the American West. including cowboys taming broncos. cavalry soldiers engaged in battle. and Native American warriors and scouts. Remington first headed west to the Montana Territory in 1881. Upon his return east. he sold his first sketches to Harpers Weekly. thus beginning his career as a magazine illustrator. In the mid 1880s. Remington moved from illustration to watercolor and oil painting. and in 1895 began sculpting in bronze. He ultimately produced nearly 3.000 drawings and paintings. 22 sculptures. and eight volumes of writings throughout his career. Frederic Remington died on December 26. 1909. thus making 2009 the 100th anniversary of his death. Unfortunately. he was only 48 years old and died at the height of his popularity. In 1961 the U.S. Postal Service issued a stamp to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Frederic Remingtons birth. The stamp featured an oil painting drawn by Remington in 1905 entitled ""Smoke Signal."" Over 111 million Remington stamps were issued by the Postal Service. Remingtons works can be found throughout the nation. in some -of Americas most -highly regarded museums. including the Art Institute in Chicago. the Metropolitan Museum of Art. and many others. Indeed. President Obama has kept ""The Bronco Buster."" the stirring Remington sculpture. in a prominent location within the Oval Office at the White House. Today. a comprehensive collection of original Remington paintings. sketches and sculptures are housed at the Frederic Remington Art Museum. founded in 1923. and located in Ogdensburg. New York. The Remington Museum is open yearround. and offers many programs for the public. including school tours. gallery talks. exhibit openings and workshops. Since the Museums founding. purchases and donations of Remington art and personal artifacts have added significantly to the breadth of this amazing collection. The Remington Museums importance to the residents of my Congressional District can be attributed to both its cultural and historical significance. as well as its economic impact on the surrounding community. Frederic Remington was. indeed. one of Northern New Yorks most famous residents and it is fitting we honor his artistic contributions to the world. It is also fitting that Ogdensburg. one of Americas most historic destinations. be the home of such an equally historic figure. Located along the strategic St. Lawrence River. Ogdensburg was the site of key battles during the French and Indian War as well the War of 1812. In fact. the city was captured by British forces during the famed Battle of Ogdensburg in the War of 1812. Ogdensburg was also the site of the appropriately titled Ogdensburg Agreement of 1940. This was a joint defense pact signed between Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King and - President Franklin Roosevelt. It is also fitting that such a storied city has a duly historic post office. In fact. the Ogdensburg Post Office was listed in the National Historic Register in 1977. The building serves as the oldest active post office in New York State and among the oldest in the United States. It was constructed between 1867 and 1870. and is truly a building befitting of this honor. Of note. on August 7. 1872. President Ulysses S. Grant visited the building for a public reception. It is also very likely Frederic Remington himself would have sent some of. his correspondence from the very post office that will be dedicated in his name. Accordingly. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation to designate the Ogdensburg.

1110000327,"Mr. President. I offer today private relief legislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Jacqueline Coats. a 28yearold widow currently living in San Francisco. Mrs. Coats came to the U.S. in 2001 from Kenya on a student visa to study Mass Communications at San Jose State University. Her visa status lapsed in 2003. and the Department of Homeland Security began deportation * proceedings against her. Mrs. Coats married Marlin Coats on April 17. 2006. after dating for several years. The couple was happily married and planning to start a family when. on May 13. Mr. Coats tragically died in a heroic attempt to save two young boys from drowning. The couple had been on a Mothers Day outing at Ocean Beach with some of Mr. Coats nephews when they heard cries for help. Having worked as a lifeguard in the past. Mr. Coats instinctively dove into the water. The two children were saved with the help of a rescue crew. but Mr. Coats. caught in a riptide. died. Mrs. Coats received a medal honoring her husband. Four days before Mr. Coats death. the couple prepared and signed an application for a green card at their attorneys offibe. Unfortunately the petition was not filed until after his death. rendering it invalid. Mrs. Coats currently has a hearing before an immigration judge in San Francisco on August 24. but her attorney has informed my staff that she has no relief available to her and will be ordered deported. Mrs. Coats. devastated by the loss of her husband. is now caught in a battle for her right to stay in America. At a recent news conference with her lawyer. Thip Ark. she explained of her situation. ""I feel like I have nothing to live for. I have nothing to go home to . . . Ive been here four years . . . It would be like starting a new life."" Ms. Ark explains that Mrs. Coats is extremely close with her late husbands family. with whom she lives in San Leandro. California. Mrs. Coats has said that her husbands large family has become her own. Ramona Burton of San Francisco. one of Marlin Coats seven brothers and sisters explains. ""She spent her first American Christmas with us. her first American Thanksgiving . . . I cant imagine looking around and not seeing her there. She needs to be there."" The San Francisco and Bay Area community has rallied strong support for Mrs. Coats. The San Francisco chapters of the NAACP. the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. and the San Francisco Police Department. have all passed resolutions in support of Mrs. Coats right to remain in the country. Unfortunately. if this private relief bill is not approved. this young woman. and the Coats family. will face yet another disorienting and heartbreaking tragedy. Mrs. Coats will be deported to Kenya. a country she has not lived in since she was 21. In her time of grieving. she will be forced to leave her home. her job with AC Transit. her new family. and everything she has known for the past 5 years. I cannot think of a compelling reason why the United States should not allow this young widow to continue the green card process. Had her husband lived. Mrs. Coats would have filed the papers without difficulty. It was because of her husbands selfless and heroic act that Mrs. Coats must now struggle to remain in the country. As one concerned California constituent wrote to me. ""If ever there was a case where common fairness. morality and decency should reign over legal technicalities. this is it. We. as a country. need to reward heroism and good."" I believe that we can reward the late Mr. Coats for his noble actions by granting his wife citizenship. It is what he intended for her. It can even be argued that a green card for his wife was one of his dying wishes. as the papers were signed just 4 days prior to his death. For these reasons. I reintroduce this private relief immigration bill and ask my colleagues to support it on behalf of Mrs. Coats. Mr. President.

1110022479,"Mr. Chair. I rise to oppose HR 1388. The idea that it is legitimate for the federal government to take money from one group of citizens and use that money to bribe other citizens into performing ""national service"" violates the basic moral principles of individual liberty that this country was founded upon. I would make three pqints to those of my colleagues who try to justify this bill by saying that participation in the programs are voluntary. First. participation in the program is not voluntary for the taxpayers. Second. nothing in the bill prevents federal taxpayer dollars from being used to support state and local programs that force children to perform ""community service"" as a condition of graduating from high school. Because an increasing number of schools across the nation are forcing children to provide ""service"" as a condition of graduating. it is quite likely that the funds authorized by this bill will be used to support mandatory service. Third. and most importantly. by legitimizing the idea that it is an appropriate role for the government to promote ""service."" legislation such as H.R. 1388 opens the door for mandatory national service. Today. influential voices in both major parties are calling for a national program of mandatory service as well as a resumption of the military draft. With the increased need for more troops for the administrations expanded military adventurism in Afghanistan. as well as the continuing movement to conscript young people not eligible for military service to serve the government at home. can anyone doubt that this bill is only the down payment on a much larger program of mandatory national service? The moral case against national service was eloquently expressed by former President Ronald Reagan in the publication Human Events in 1979: "". . . it [national service and conscription] rests on the assumption that your kids belong to the state. If we buy that assumption then it is for the statenot for parents. the community. the religious institutions or teachersto decide who shall have what values and who shall do what work. when. where and how in our society. That assumption isnt a new one. The Nazis thought it was a great idea."" Mr. Chair. millions of Americans including many young people. are already volunteering their time and talents to help their fellow citizens and better their communities without being bribed by the govdmment. In fact. to suggest that the young Americans need a federal check as an incentive to volunteer is an insult to the American people.

1110041297,"I thank my colleague for yielding me such time as I might use. Aloha. I rise today to join my fellow congressional Asian Pacific Islander American Caucus members in celebrating Asian Pacific Islander American Heritage Month. Of course. Id like to thank Congressman HONDA for organizing this Special Order tonight and for his continuing leadership throughout the Vear and his service as the chair of CAPAC. In 1978. a joint congressional resolution established Asian Pacific American Heritage Week. The first 10 days of May were chosen to coincide with two key anniversaries The U.S. arrival of the first Japanese immigrant on May 7. 1843. and the completion of the transcontinental railroad on May 10. 1869. In 1992. Congress expanded the week to a full monthlong celebration of the Asian and Pacific Islander American community. We certainly have added to the diversity and the cultural richness of our country. As a first generation immigrant myself. having come to this country when I was about eight- years old. this country has afforded not just me. but the millions of immigrants. the first generation we call issei and nisei. opportunities that we never would have had in our home countries. With 16.2 million residents. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are one of the fastest growing populations in the United States. In fact. the Census Bureau estimates that by the year 2050. more than 33.4 million Asian Americans will call the United States home. Asian and Pacific Islander Americans have made valuable contributions to every aspect of American lifefrom business to education to politics to the arts to. the military. For example. there are approximately 1.1 miflion APIAowned small businesses all across the country that employ 2.2 million workers. There are also hundreds of thousands of APIA servicemembers and veterans. including more than 53.500 brave men and women who have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan since Today. I was glad to join my colleagues in supporting passage of H.R. 347. which appropriately awards a Congressional Gold Medal to the 100th Infantry Battalion and the 442nd Regimental Combat Team in honor of their extraordinary and dedicated service during World War II. Comprised predominantly of nisei. the Americanborn sons of Japanese immigrants. members of the University of Hawaiis Reserve Officers Training Corps. the ROTC. aided the wounded. buried the fallen. and helped defend vulnerable areas in Hawaii after the attack at Pearl Harbor. In spite of these acts of courage. the U.S. Army discharged all nisei in the ROTC unit. changed their draft status to ineligible. and segregated all Japanese American in the military on the mainland out of their units. In the meantime. more than 100.000 Japanese Americans were forcibly relocated from their homes to internment camps. Undaunted. members of the Hawaii Provisional Infantry Battalion joined the 100th Infantry Battalion in California to train as soldiers. The sheer determination and pursuit of excellence displayed by this battalion in training contributed to President Roosevelts decision to allow nisei volunteers to serve in the U.S. military again. leading to their incorporation into the 442nd. Members of the 100th and 442nd risked their lives to fight for our country and allies in Europe. The 442nd ""Go for Broke"" unit became the most decorated in U.S. military history for its size and length of service. with its component. the 100th Infantry Battalion. earning the nickname ""The Purple Heart Battalion."" Id like to thank Congressman SCHIFF. the chief sponsor of H.R. 347. for providing us with. the opportunity to bestow this bodys most distinguished honor. the Congressional Gold Medal. to these brave soldiers on the behalf of a grateful Nation. I would be rerhiss if I did not mention one of Hawaiis favorite sons as we celebrate this month. and that is Presi.dent Barack Obama. While not ethnically Asian American or Pacific Islander himself. his ties to our community are strong ones. and his support on our issues could not be more heartfelt. He has appointed. as mentioned earlier. Asian Americans to key cabinet positions: Steven Chu. Secretary of Energy. Gary Locke. Secretary of Commerce. By the way. Gary Locke is the first Asian American to be elected Governor outside of Hawaii. And Kauais own General Eric Shinseki. Secretary of Veteran Affairs. One of the issues that President Obama has supported is selfdetermination for the indigenous people of our Stateof Hawaiinative Hawaiians who deserve to have the §ame right to selfdetermination enjoyed by other indigenous groups such as the American Indians and the Alaskan natives. H.R. 2314. the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act. would set up a process for native Hawaiians to organize a governmental entity. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and. our President in passing this important bill. I would also be remiss if I did not pay tribute to my predecessor. Congresswoman Patsy T. Mink of Hawaii. a trailblazer in every sense of the word. I thank my colleague. Congresswoman RICHARDSON. - for mentioning Patsy Mink. for whom title IX was renamed the Patsy T..Mink Equal Opportunity .in Education Act. Title IX changed the lives of women and girls across our country. In fact. a couple of years ago. several of the high schools in my district were given a special recognition for really promoting title IX and participation of high school girls in sports. When I attended one of these high schools to present them with a special recognition. one of the girls asked me a question that totally floored me. That question was. If you could pick a sport. what sport would you have participated in? And it floored me because it was a question that had never been.asked when I was in high school. Thats the kind of difference that title IX is making. In fact. Patsys own daughter. when she applied to a particular school and did not get accepted. the reason for that was. they told her. We have enough women in our university. This all preceded.title IX. Literally thousands and thousands of lives have been change by title IX. In closing. Id like to also once again thank Chairman HONDA for allowing us this opportunity to reflect upon how far our APIA community has come. and.yet we must remember how much further our community has to go.

1110068770,Mr. Speaker. in January. President Obama and congressional Democrats promised spending another trillion dollars would create jobs immediately and that unemployment would not rise above 8 percent. Almost 1 year later. millions of Americans are still plagued by unemployment and many are struggling to make ends meet. In October. 190.000 jobs were lost and more than 2.8 million jobs have been lost since the socalled stimulus was signed by President Obama. The American people continue to ask. Where are the jobs? I can safely say the answer lies in the House Republican economic recovery plan. Our plan provides targeted tax relief for working families and small businesses.

1110060239,I yield myself as much time as I may consume. When were talking about the $10 billion savings to the deficit and using CBO numbers. the number that we like to talk about. if you look at the overall cost of the budget. CBO numbers in the discretionary side. what this bill would do to the discretionary side. theyre transferring money out of the mandatory into the discretionary side for administration. And. also. as we expand Pell Grants. with this bill we will expand Pell Grants. on the mandatory side. which this bill scores. it doesnt score what will happen in the discretionary side. Part of Pell Grants are discretionary. so if you expand Pell Grant applicants in the mandatory side. it is also going to require additional appropriations. And we believe that the admin in the discretionary side plus the expansion of Pell Grants from CBO numbers is $13.5 billion cost to the system. which is more than the $10 billion that were putting in the deficit reduction now. So we will have to increase more than were putting in the deficit reduction. The other thing is. these numbers were scored by CBO in March. and the most uptodate numbers of people participating in the Pell Grants as of Augustnow that were here in Septemberthe August numbers believe that it will be $11.4 billion in added Pell Grant costs when using the most uptodate numbers. And so I think those are real numbers that we can talk about. We are already up toI guess its $25 billion of costs that this will have when were talking about $10 billion in savings. The one thing that wasnt taken into account eitherand these are numbers that could come to pass or not. but those first two numbers I think are real. The other is the $33 billion that CBO says hasnt been identified that are market risk to the program. Now. thats market risk: so you could have them. you could not have them. Ill cede that.

1110019850,That is a good point. and that has certainly been made by the other side of the aisle: Well. under the Bush administration all this spending was done and this debt was run up. In the first 5 years of the Obama administration. under their budgetnot our numbers. their numbersthey will spend more and they will run up the debt on the country more and on our children more than all the Presidents since the beginning of our RepublicGeorge Washington to George Bush. Take all those Presidents and put all the debt they put on the ledger of America. and in this budget President Obama is planning to run up more debt -than occurred under all those Presidents. It is a massive expansion in debt. It is also an interesting exercise in tax policy. Now. I know. we are not talking so much about taxes today. but I think it is important to point out that when you put a $1.4 trillion tax increase on the American people. you reduce productivity in this country rather dramatically. One of the unique things about President Bushs term was that he set a tax policy which actually caused us to have 4 yearsprior to this massive recession. which is obviously a significant problem and a very difficult situationbut for the runup during the middle part of his term right up until this recession started. the Federal Government was generating more revenues than it had ever generated in its history. Why was that? Because we had a tax policy which basically taxed people in a way that caused them to go out. and be productive. to create jobs. and to do things which were taxable events. Unfortunately. what is being proposed here. under this administrations tax policy. is going to cause people to do tax avoidance. Instead of investing to create jobs. they will go out to invest to try to avoid taxes. and that is not an efficient way to use dollars. The practical effect is it will reduce revenues and increase the deficit. So on your point. the simple fact is. as this proposal comes forward from the administration. it increases the debt of the United States more in 5 years than all the Presidents of the United States have increased the debt since the beginning of the Republic.,111114171,GREGG,JUDD,S,NH,M,R,,voting,2009-03-11,64,Mr. GREGG,3998,4058,03112009.txt,2168,387,111,2009,good point certainli made side aisl well bush administr spend done debt run first year obama administr budgetnot number numbersthey spend run debt countri children presid sinc begin washington georg bush take presid put debt put ledger america budget presid obama plan run debt occur presid massiv expans debt also interest exercis tax polici know talk much tax today think import point put trillion tax increas american peopl reduc product countri rather dramat one uniqu thing presid bush term set tax polici actual caus us massiv recess obvious signific problem difficult runup middl part term right recess start feder govern gener revenu ever gener histori tax polici basic tax peopl way caus go product creat job thing taxabl event unfortun propos administr tax polici go caus peopl tax avoid instead invest creat job go invest tri avoid tax effici way use dollar practic effect reduc revenu increas deficit point simpl fact propos come forward administr increas debt unit state year presid unit state increas debt sinc begin republ,171,FALSE

1110043775,Madam President. a little later this morning. the President will discuss his decision to close Guantanamo by an arbitrary deadline that is now only 8 months away. It is clear to both Republicans and Democrats in Congress that the administration does not currently have a plan for closing Guantanamo and that closing -it without a plan is simply unacceptable. So I hope the President uses his remarks this morning to presezit a concrete plan that demonstrates how closing Guantanamo will keep Americans as safe as Guantanamo has. We know the FBI has serious concerns about any plans to release or transfer other detainees into the United States. Just yesterday. FBI Director Mueller said detainees who are sent to U.S. soil. even if they are only sent  to secure detention facilities. might still be able to conduct terrorist activities. much like gang leaders who have been able to run their gangs from prison. Director Mueller also stated that detainees released or transferred 0 Printed on recycled paper. into the United States could endanger the American people by radicalizing others or providing financial support for terrorism. Director Muellers testimony appears to undermine the claim that sending detainees to the United States is a safe alternative to Guantanamo. Yesterday. the Senate. spoke with near unanimity. by a vote of 90 to 6. against sending terrorist detainees to U.S. soila vote that mirrored a vote 2 years ago on the same question. The Senate also expressed its view yesterday that Congress expects its relevant committees to be briefed on the threat posed by the terrorists at Guantanamo. So it is clear that Senate Democrats do not believe circumstances have changed over the last 2 years in such a way that would warrant releasing or transferring terrorists into America. If the President believes circumstances have changed. then he has an opportunity to explain those changes this morning. The American people are asking the administration to guarantee that any terrorist it releases or transfers will not return to the battlefield. This is particularly urgent in light of a New York Times report this morning that says one in .seven detainees already released has returned to terrorism. The President has an opportunity to reassure the American people that future releases will not lead to the same result. If he is not able to provide specifics about his plan for terrorist detainees at Guantanamo. he could still provide this assurance by simply revising his policy. The President has already shown adaptability on military commissions. on prisoner photos. on Iraq. on Afghanistan. and on Pakistan. Here is an opportunity to show more of that flexibility on Guantanamo.

1110062950,I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of House Resolution 90. which recognizes the importance of safety on college campuses and promotes the idea of National Campus Safety. As a community college professor for 20 years and the author of a California bill. the Campus Sexual Assault Safety Act. I understand firsthand how vital campus safety is to enhancing the learning experiences of its students. but more importantly. how raising awareness can serve to prevent campus violence. We have witnessed this in several tragic cases. for instance. in the case of the death of Jeanne Clery in the late 1980s. who was a freshman at Lehigh University. On April 5. 1986. Jeanne was beaten. raped and murdered in her dormitory room. Jeannes case brought college campus safety to the forefront when it exposed flaws in the reporting of crime information related to violence on colleges campuses. At that time. both violent and nonviolent incidents were reported to campus authorities. but administrators had no legal obligation to disclose violent college crimes to the public. In the aftermath of Jeannes murder. her parents. Connie and Howard Clery. founded Security on Campus. Inc.. to end violence on all college campuses. It is a nonprofit. grassroots organization dedicated to making campuses safe. Partnering with over 150 colleges from 42 States. Security on Campus. Inc.. offers educational programs on sexual assault. alcohol and drugs. Over the past few years. we have seen how important it is to pay attention to our students safety on campus. It is unfortunate that it takes tragic events like those occurring at Virginia Tech and Northern Illinois for us to remember that crimes take place on college campuses all over the country. More recently. Annie Le. a Yale University graduate student was allegedly murdered and found dead on campus the day she planned to marry her college sweetheart. The reauthorization of the Higher Education Act last year took new action to improve campus safety. It required each educational institution to clearly articulate a method to disseminate emergency notifications to the entire campus body in the case of an emergency. The law also includes measures to ensure that campus preparedness employees coordinate with local law enforcement and emergency management authorities to improve responses to campus emergencies. Campus safety is relevant. important and necessary. Anyone can become a victim of a campus crime. and it is imperative that students are taught how to avoid dangerous situations. Congress must continue to encourage institutions to update their campus security plans and ensure systems are in place to deal with all types of emergencies. As we commemorate National Campus Safety Awareness Month in September. let us focus our efforts on educating our students about campus safety. Students need to be reminded every year about practical precautions to increase their safety. Mr. Speaker. once again. I express my support for National Campus Safety Awareness Month and thank Representative SESTAK for bringing this resolution forward. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

1110072641,Mr. President. I congratulate the Senator from Idaho for his amendment to help the President keep his commitment. That is basically what it is. I would think our friends on the other side would all want to join us in that. The President said he would not raise taxes on people making less than $250.000 a year. It is amazing to hear the comments that I have just heard. The whole construction of the billwhen we think about it. regardless of whatever the Democrats decide to do about the socalled public option. they still seem determinedat least the majority leadership seems determinedto engage in this political kamikaze mission toward a historic mistake. There is all this talk about history. But there are lots of different kinds of history. A lot of historic mistakes have been made about taxes. For example. there was the SmootHawley tariff of 1930. which was a big tax. It sounded like a good idea. President Hoover. a Republican. recommended it to protect American jobs by keeping out cheaper foreign products. That led us into the Great Depression. It was a historic mistake. More recently. there was the boat luxury tax. This sounds good. It was part of the budget deal of 1990. Congress put a 10percent luxury tax on boats costing more than $100.000. Sound familiar? We were going to hit the rich people. But it got the working people. not the rich people. The unintended consequence was that it sank the boat industry. costing 7.600 jobs. according to the Joint Economic Commission. and Congress repealed that historic mistake. There was also the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988. another goodsounding goal. to help older people reduce the risk for illnessrelated catastrophic financial losses. But a lot of our senior Americans resented the idea of paying additional taxes for that coverage. and they revolted. Congress. less than a year and a half later. repealed it. We all remember the millionaires tax. That is a matter of history. In the late 1960s. there were 155 highincome Americans who werent paying any Federal income taxes. so Congress imposed something called the alternative minimum tax. Last year. that affected 28 million American taxpayers. I say to my friend from Idaho. I think he is doing the country and the President a great service by offering this amendment to help keep the promise because whatever the majority leader decides to do about the government option. this legislationwhen fully implementedstill contains $1 million in Medicare cuts 5 years before Medicare is scheduled to go broke. according to their trustees. It is nearly $1 trillion in new taxes over 10 years when fully implemented. as the Senator from Idaho has pointed out. There is no question about that. it is an increase in premiums for most Americans. according to the Congressional Budget Office. And yesterday on this floor. we talked about the huge bill we are about to send to States to help pay for this in the Medicaid Program. It is important to support the Crapo motion.

1110039626,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. there are fewer great honors. I think. in Congress than to stand in support of this bill which affirms the goals of Mothers Day and celebrates the role of mothers in the United States. I first would like to thank Mr. FORTENBERRY. the gentleman from Nebraska. for his courage in going out on a limb here and introducing this legislation. I would also like to commend Chairman TowNs and my colleagues on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for bringing this resolution to the floor by unanimous consent in their infinite wisdom. On Sunday. we celebrated the 101st Mothers Day. It may come as a surprise to some. particularly our own .mothers. that it took our country over 130 years to officially designate a day praising motherhood. Nevertheless. it is important to annually pause and recall that our lives and our countrys history would have been much different but for the contributions of our mothers to our families and to our country. I would not presume: nor am I brave enough. to speak on behalf of Americas 82 million mothers. instead. I would simply like to speak to their importance in shaping our society and our future. Mothers are indeed the backbdne of the American family. With great love and compassion. they lay the founda_tion for all children to grow into honorable citizens. It is no stretch to say that our sustained national character of goodwill and moral strength is the result of dedicated motherhood. . Many of our greatest national heroes attribute their own successes to the guidance of their mothers. While examples are numerous. I will quote President Abraham Lincoln who once said of his own angel mother. ""I remember my mothers prayers. and they have always followed me. They have clung to me all my life."" I am sure that similar thanks and acknowledgements are appropriate for the mothers of every American. I am sure of that. Mr. Speaker.

1110007112,Thats right. One of the things that really breaks my heart. though. about all of this. we can talk about it from a lofty level here in the second floor of the U.S. Capitol. but the truth is during the Bush terms of office. Republicans went from a time when they were the ones that .balanced the budget in the 1990s. and they moved to a time when there was just euphoria. Yes. tax cuts happened. and as a result. record revenues just poured into the U.S. Treasury in greater amounts than ever before. It wasnt the tax cuts that were a problem. It wasnt the record revenue coming in. We. and it was before I got here. but we were spending too much money. In my first 2 years here beginning in January of 2005. we were spending too much money. It was a problem. We were not reining in money. And as a result. by November of 2006. people were sick of it. It was irresponsible. and it was so grossly unfair to our children and the generations to follow us. we got voted out of the majority. And Democrats talked about our irresponsible spending. that we were running up the deficit and it was so unfair to the children. according to the Democrats at that time. And the voters said. youre right. these Republicans have lost their way. get them out of the majority. And now here weve seen with the Democratic majority. about an 80vote margin in the House. a Democrat majority in the Senate. in a weeks time. there has been $1.2 trillion in allocations above the budget. Thats the same amount that all American income taxpayers.will pay in for personal income tax for 2008.

1110032198,Mr. Speaker. today I rise in support of S.J. Res. 8. a bill to nominate David M. Rubenstein to the Smithsonian Board of Regents. As a Member of the Board of Regents Governance and Nominating Committee which selected Mr. Rubenstein to join the Board. I wanted to express my support for moving his nomination. Mr. Rubenstein is a native of Baltimore and graduated magna cum laude from Duke. and from the University of Chicago Law School. where he was editor of the law review. Mr. Rubenstein is CoFounder and Managing Director of The Carlyle Group. one of the worlds largest private equity firms. David is widely respected for his business prowess. The Smithsonian. like many institutions during these challenging economic times. faces serious funding issues . . . and it is more important than ever to have Members of the Board with financial expertise. As part of our Governance efforts. we specifically adopted policy changes that turned the corner toward stronger oversight and accountability. including adopting regent description. These expectations of Regents include overseeing the Smithsonians mission. as well as attending regular committee and full Board meetings. As such. we searched to find someone like David Rubenstein. Someone who is committed to giving back to his community. he is.on the Board of Directors of Duke. the Kennedy Center and the Lincoln Center for Performing Arts. among others. And who has committed to moving the Smithsonian forward during these challenging economic times. he has helped the Carlyle Group grow to a firm with 33 offices around the world. Today. Mr. Rubenstein is being nominated for the vacant seat that Anne dHarnoncourt held. Anne was a great colleague on the Board and truly committed to the -1146b3 Smithsonians mission. She was also chief executive officer of the Philadelphia Museum of Art from 1982 until her death in 2008. An acclaimed author and internationally respected art historian and administrator. she has been a part of the Smithsonian Institution since 1974. Serving on the Board of Regents from 1995 until 2007 and was awarded Regent Emerita status. Her early death was a tragic loss to the arts community and to the Smithsonian. and she is mrssed. . Her dedication to the Smithsonians mission of the increase and diffusion of knowledge is something that David Rubenstein shares. And I look forward to serving with him on the Board of Regents to promote the Smithsonians mission in the 21st century.

1110042394,Madam President. this amendment is very simple. -You heard me many times come to the fl6or to talk about the housing tax credit. The tax credit we finally amended to repeal the payback provision of $8.000 for firsttime home buyers has brought an improvement in home sales of 40 percent at the entry level. This amendment merely removes the means test of a maximum income of $150.000 for a couple and $75.000 for an individual. and it removes the means test that they have to be a firsttime home buyer. which means any home buyer buying a home fo their principal residence would receive an $8.000 tax credit and there would be no limitation to their income to disqualify them. I have always fought on this floor for a maximum tax credit of $15.000. and I * know how difficult that has been. But in the evidence of what has happened with the current $8.000 with the means test. by removing it I am confident we will have a significant improvement in * the housing market in America. which in turn will cause a.significant improvement in the economy of the United States of America. as happened in 1968. 1974. 1981. 1982 and 1990 to 1991. Housing took America into a recession. * and it was only when it recovered that America began to come out. This improvement in that amendment. with this amendment. will be - better for the people of the United States of America and better for our economy.

It is always good for the conference. of which the University of Missouri is a great member. that we win the national championship which I have all confidence that my beloved Longhorns will do. Moving right along to the other important issues of today. I certainly am serious when I start talking about the issue that is before us today. I see the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee sitting on the floor. The winner of the Congressional Medal of Honor. the only Member of our body who has that great distinction. and well deserved. Senator DAN INOUYE is one of the great leaders who fought in World War II. was a hero. was given the Congressional Medal of Honor. our Nations highest military honor that can be bestowed. He has led our committee in such a commendable way. Senator INOUYE has always assured that we have the support for our troops. I have served with Senator INOUYE and Senator COCHRAN. our ranking member. and Senator Ted Stevens before him. I can tell you that all of these Senators have led our Defense Appropriations Committee. They have led it by assuring that our troops always have what they need. whether they are in the field of battle. which has been the case for part of our terms here. or whether they are not in the field of battle which has also been the case for much of our terms here. But it happens that our troops are on the field of battle today. That is why I have supported this appropriations bill. supported it as a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and certainly am assured that we have the appropriations that give our troops who are in harms way today the support they need. I was in Iraq this year. I was in Afghanistan and Iraq last year visiting with those who are doing the work that keeps us free. that allows us to speak on this floor. that allow us to have Christmas holidays with our families. There is not a better experience in my entire time in public life than to get to visit with our troops on the field when they are in harms way. I have been to Bosnia when we were in Bosnia. Kosovo. then Iraq. Afghanistan. Kuwait. where we have so many troops who are supporting our troops in Iraq. and also now supporting our troops with the equipment transfers into Afghanistan.

1110026524,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. this is Public Health Week. TomorroW. my subcommittee. that is. the Health Subcommittee of Energy and Commerce. will be holding a hearing on the role of public health and health care reform. Well be exploring the role of public health systems and policies and improving the health status of all Americans. We have before us today a bipartisan set of bills that exemplify this. The bills make a range of policy and program changes designed to keep Americans safer.. help them access needed services. and support research into important health problems. These bills have been introduced and cosponsored by Members on both sides of the aisle. They all passed the House under suspension in the last Congress. They were passed unanimously from committee this year. and I urge you to join me and the broad set of cosponsors in supporting these bills. The first one. Mr. Speaker. is H.R. 1246. the Early Hearing Detection Intervention Act. I rise obviously in support of that. Every year. more than 12.000 babies are born with hearing loss. Often. their condition goes undetected for years. and many of these children end up exDeriencing delAy. in speech. language. and cognitive development. However. if the hearing loss is detected early. many of these delays can be mitigated or even prevented. For that reason. early detection is critical to improving outcomes for these children. The Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Act would improve services for screening. diagnosing. and treating hearing loss in children by amending the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Program which was first enacted in 2000. The Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Program provides grants and cooperative agreements for statewide newborn and infant hearing services. These programs focus on screening. evaluation. diagnosis. and early intervention. I do want to particularly thank my colleague. Representative CAPPS. for her hard work on this very important issue.

1110072679,Mr. President. I want to speak a little today about this issue of the tax burden the Reid bill is putting on people with incomes under $250.000. $200.000. We all know the President said he was not going to allow taxes to increase for people who have incomes under those numbers. We know there are all sorts of proposals in the Reid bill which significantly increase taxes. We also know there are a lot of proposals in the Reid bill that significantly increase fees. We also know there are a lot of proposals in the Reid bill which will significantly increase premiumsall of which people under $200.000 pay. Why is this? Primarily it is because. if you look at the Reid bill. it exponentially increases spending and grows the size of government. Government is increased by $2.5 trillion under the Reid bill when it is fully phased in. It goes from 20 percent of our gross national productthat is what government takes out today in spendingup to about 24 percent of our gross national product. a huge increase in the size of government. When spending increases like this. at this type of explosive rate. there are a couple of things that occur. One of them is that taxes also go up. It is like day following night. If you are going to increase the size of the government at this rate. you are going to have to significantly increase taxeswhether you call them fees or whether you call them premium increases or whether you call them outright taxes. That is what is happening. That is because the goal is to grow the government dramatically. That is the goal. When you grow the government. you inevitably increase the taxes. In fact. in this bill it is estimated. when it is fully put into place. that there will be about $1.6 or $1.7 trillion in new taxes. There is also. when it is fully phased in. about $1 trillion of reduction in Medicare spending. We have had a lot of discussion on that matter on the Senate floor. I have been here a number of times talking about that. But the burden of taxation goes up in order to allegedly pay for these new entitlements. Why do the taxes have to go up? Because when you increase spending this way you have to pay for itor you should pay for it. This bill attempts to do that by raising taxes dramatically. But the presentation that you can get all this tax revenue out of people who are making more than $200.000 a year simply doesnt fly. It doesnt pass the commonsense test. It is like saying when you cut Medicare $1 trillion you are not going to affect benefits. We heard for a week from the other side of the aisle that no Medicare benefit cuts would occur with $1 trillion of Medicare cuts. Of course. that is not true. We just heard yesterday from the Actuarythe Presidents Actuary. by the way. the Actuary of CMSthat when you make these significant reductions in provider payments under Medicare. which is where most of the savings occur. that means there are fewer providers who are going to be able to be profitable. In fact. 20 percent of providers will be unprofitable under the Reid bill as scored by the Actuary for CMS. and. as a result. providers will drop out of the system. Clearly. that will affect benefits to seniors because they will not be able to see providers because they will not exist anymore. It is like telling somebodysomeone said. the Senator from Nebraska. I think. saidyou can have keys to the car. but there is no car. In this instance there will be no providers or many fewer providers. Along with that problem there is this claimalong with that claim that was totally inaccurate. which is that Medicare benefits will not be cutthere is this claim that these new revenues to pay for this massive expansion in spending are going to come from just the wealthy. Again. we have independent sources that have taken a look at this. in this case the Joint Tax Committee. They have concluded that is not the case. That is not the case at all. The argument from the other side of the aisle is we have all these tax credits in here which. when you balance them out against the tax increases. meaning that people earning under $200.000because some will get tax credits. some will get tax increases. but they balance out so there is virtual evenness. so that the tax credits in the bill to subsidize people who do not have insurance today mostly are balanced by the tax increases on people earning under $200.000. Of course. if you are one of the people earning under $200.000 who doesnt get the tax credit. that doesnt mean a whole lot. Your taxes are going up. But more importantly. Joint Tax has taken a look at this. and by our estimate. what Joint Tax has said is essentially this: 73 million families. or about 43 percent of all returns under the number of $200.000. people with incomes of under $200.000. will. in 2019. have their taxes go up. So there is a tax increase in this bill. and it is very significant on people earning under $200.000. In fact. if you compare that to those people who will benefit from the tax credit. what it amounts to is for every one person who is going to benefit from the tax credit. three people earning under the income of $200.000 will see their taxes go up. That is a real problem. first. because it significantly violates the pledge of the President when he said: I can make a firm pledge no family making less than $250.000 will see their taxes increasenot your income taxes. not your payroll taxes. not your capital gain taxesnot any of your taxes. That is what the President said. That pledge is violated by the Reid bill. violated very fundamentally for the 73 million people whose incomes are under $200.000 and whose taxes go up. So it clearly is not a taxneutral event for middleincome people. It is a tax increase event for a large number of middleincome people. Fortythree percent of all people paying taxes whose income is under $200.000 will have their taxes increased. What is the thought process behind this? The thought process essentially seems to be we are going to explode the size of government. we are going to dramatically increase the taxes on the American people. and somehow that is going to make life better for Americans. I do not see that happening. I dont see that happening. We know from our experience as a government that growing the government in this exponential way probably is going to lead to people having a tougher time making ends meet because their tax burden is going to go up. Discretionary dollars they might have used to send their kids to college or they might have used to buy a new house or they might have used to buy a new car or they might have just simply savedthose discretionary dollars they dont have anymore because they come to the government to fund this massive explosion in programs and this increase in the size of government. I think we do not need to look too far to see how this model does not work. All we have to do is look at our European neighbors. This idea that you can Europeanize the economy. that somehow if you grow the government you create prosperity. that is what is basically behind this philosophy: You grow the government. you create prosperity. That does not work. We know that does not work. All we have to do is look at our neighbors in Europe who have used that model to find out and conclude that does not work. It would make much more sense to put in place an affordable plan. one which did not raise the taxes of 73 million people who file income taxes under the income of $200.000. 43 percent of the people paying taxes. It would make much more sense not to grow the government in this extraordinary way that we know we cannot afford and that we know ends up passing on to our kids a country which has less of a standard of living than we received from our parents. So I hope we take another look at all the taxes in the bill. recognizing that the commitment the President made on the issue of taxes is not being fulfilled by this bill. and go back to the drawing board and reorganize it so we can come closer to what the President wanted. which was a bill that did not raise taxes. which was a bill that did insure everyone. which was a bill that did create an atmosphere where if you wanted to keep your present insurance. you could keep it. and which was a bill that turns the curve of health care costs down. None of those four goals of the President are now met in the bill. In fact. according to his own Actuary and according to Joint Tax. for all four of those goals. just the opposite occurs. The number of people uninsured remains at 24 million people. the cost curve goes up by $235 billion. taxes go up for 73 million people. and we end up with 17 million people who have insurance today in the private sector losing that insurance. So I believe we should take another look at this bill and try to do a better job. Mr. President.

1110003860,"I thank the gentleman from New Jersey . I would like to just thank him for the years and years and years of commitment that he has had to the unborn here in America. The unborn have had a friend in CHRIs SMITH. I thank you. That through thick and thin. it seems like we got a lot closer to our goal. Right now. it seems like we are a lot farther away when you look at the way the winds are prevailing. It has been 36 years since we have had the fateful decision of Roe v. Wade. In 36 years. we look at the fruit of that decision and what it has led to. Has it been freedom for women? Some might say so. Has it been enslavement for women? There are a lot of women who testify that yes. it has been enslavement for them. to years of depression. fighting perhaps alcoholism. drug addiction. because they had no idea what terminating the life of their little child would do to them in terms of ripping up their insides. They didnt really know what the decision would mean. My husband has had the privilege of counseling women and men who have been in that decision. abortionminded women. who have later deeply regretted that decision that they made. I know for my husband and I. we are just so grateful God gave us five biological children over the years that we are grateful for. and we lost one. The baby that we lost taught us so much. When that baby died. it changed our lives. I know for me. personally. I couldnt speak for 3 days after I lost that baby. Something was touched in the center of my soul. something so deep. so fundamental about human life that I cant even put into words right now. But the one thing I do know is that we are created in the image and likeness of a holy God. I just think that we should not be about the business of taking away something that is so precious and so lifegiving and that can never be altered. It is a decision that. once its made. cant be changed. When we lost our own baby. my husband and I decided we wanted to open up our home to children that were in difficult circumstances. And so we brought in 23 children over the years. not all at once. but over the years. and it changed us for the better. bringing in kids who are in really some of the very tough. tough situations. But. you know what? I have often heard that phrase from Planned Parenthood that says. ""Every Child a Wanted Child."" I just want the American public to know. every child is a wanted child. Theres a foster parent out there that wants to take in a child in atrisksituations. There are adoptive parents out there that are crying tonight. literally crying themselves to sleep. because they want to take in a child. No. we are not talking just perfect children. We are talking special needs children. Children With disabilities of every kind. There are parents that want to adopt those children. And so when I look at.the policy that is coming down the pike here in our Nations Capitol or we are looking at reviving this policy of having the American taxpayer pay for international abortions. my heart breaks. It breaks because its all so unnecessary. Its unnecessary because there is love. There are homes. There are men. there are women that want to offer the positive alternative. For years. one of our colleagues from Pennsylvania. JOE PITTS. offered legislation called the Positive Alternatives Act. He was gracious to allow me to offer that bill last year. I offer it again now this year. It says to the men and women of America who are in a pregnancy that maybe they didnt count on that theres another way. Abortion isnt the only answer. Theres a positive alternative. Can we allow tax money. your tax money. the American people. to go to pay for international abortions? Shouldnt we allow your tax money to go to offer to pay for positive alternatives for men and women. to offer them counseling. hope. Isnt this the time of hope and change? Lets offer true hope and change that will make an eternal difference in the lives of Americas next generation. We have lost 50 million. We have lost 50 million Americans. Part of the generation that would be up and working right now to build this country into a better Nation. but we have lost them to eternity. We have lost them. I say we have a chance now for true hope and true change. to have a positive alternative so that tax money wont be spent just on death. but tax money now could be to offer life. a true positive choice. That is why I am so grateful to my colleague from New Jersey. the wonderful Representative CHRIS SMITH. because for years and years and years he has known. he has fought. He gets it. The next generation needs us. They need our voice. And that is why I am so grateful that I can be a Member of Congress. to make that message now and to make that plea with my beloved colleague. just to beg our colleagues to join us. If we can offer death. certainly our country is good enough to offer life. With that.

1110036863,Mr. President. I see our colleague from Florida has arrived. I will take a few minutes and then ask unanimous consent that he be recognized as the original author of the safe harbor provision so he has a chance to explain his point of view. Let me begin. Again. it is not necessarily the most compelling of arguments. but I think it is worthy of note that those organizations who are opposed to the amendment of the Senator from Tennessee include the Consumer Federation of America. the National Community Law Center. the National Association of Consumer Advocates. the Housing Policy Council. the Financial Roundtable. the Center for Responsible Lending. the Mortgage Insurance Corporation. Mortgage bankers. and the ABA. This is a pretty rAre collection. when we get the major consumer groups that watch all this stuff very carefully. as well as some of the major lending institutions. They never come together on anything. It is a unique moment on this proposal. Let me say to my friend from Tennessee. I dont like the situation we are in either. This is not the ideal world because his point about contracts is a valid one. There is no question. I point ed out there are contracts with second homes and vacation homes and the like as well. We had no problem with the cramdown with mortgages involved there. We have a prohibition on primary residences. but we make the exception with other properties. Frankly. had we taken the Durbin amendment. that might have minimized the importance of what we have here. Here is thie problem: 10.000 people a day are losing their homes. 20.000 a day are losing their jobs. The question is. How can we possibly get the kind of incentives so the bankers. the servicers. the lenders. and the borrowers can modify these mortgages? We now have 11 million homes in this country where the mortgage exceeds the value of the property. If we dont step up soon. those numbers will explode. We have a moratorium on foreclosures in certain areas. and that is just building up a backlog that if we dont end up with some means by which that borrower and lender can work out an arrangement that they can modify the mortgage. we will face a cascading effect which most people agree is the root cause of our financial difficulties. beginning with predatory lending and subprime lending that helped create this problem with nodocumentation loans. the liar loans and the like. What we have crafted is a rather narrow answer. They have a safe harbor provision which is very broad and. frankly. it can be narrowed. That is what Senator MARTINEZ has done with his proposal. What we are talking about are loans in the private label securities. That represents about 16 percent of what we are talking about. Yet within that 16 percent. in excess of 62 percent of those loans. are seriously delinquent loans. So while it is a relatively small number compared to the total mortgages being written. in terms of delinquent mortgages. it represents a fairly significant majority. We are narrowly dealing with those. Then we are talking about two circumstances in which they voluntarily can move. That is with the Obama plan or the HOPE for Homeowners. We are not limiting it. If people dont want to do it. there is no requirement that they do it. We are trying to remove one of the great barriers. and that is the fear of litigation. The servicers are saying: We would like to do this. We understand the value of it. We want to get paid. Banks want to get paid. Borrowers want to stay in their homes. Everybody seems to agree on that. Here is the problem: If we end up modifying this. the investor. not in illegitimate point. says: Wait a minute. we had a contract with you. Mr. Servicer. You are going to now modify this. violating our interests as an investor. Therefore. we are going to sue you. That is the fear. So the servicer says: I am not going near this. I respect the fact the borrower would like to get out of this situation in an affordable mortgage. I would like to get paid something in the process. But I will not go through the kind of litigation that will occur if there is not a safe harbor. Hence. the Martinez amendment. Jn these narrow circumstances involving 16 percent of this market. and of which 62 percent are the delinquent mortgages. under two fact situations. the HOPE for Homeowners and the Obama mortgage modification plan. we provide for that safe harbor. saying to that servicer. if. in fact. you move forward. we will provide you with that harbor and avoid the potential of litigation. in some cases even frivolous litigation. Again. in a perfect world. would I like to avoid that and do what my friend from Tennessee wants? Absolutely. But there are no perfect choices. and yet there are some potential dangers. I dont like setting a precedent. We narrowly define this in time and circumstance. only involving those that already occurred. and the problem dies or is sunsetted in December of 2012. So this is not a perpetual program. It is limited to the fact situation. limited to opportunities in order to try and provide some relief primarily to the consumer. to the person holding that mortgage or the person having that mortgage who runs the risk of losing their home. We have tried. for a year and a half. all sorts of different ways. My friend from Tennessee and the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Senator MARTINEZ. who knows something about these issues. will recall we tried. in the spring of 2007. to get these people together to try and work out things. They promised they would try. They never did. Then we drafted legislation. far from perfect because we are back today talking about it. called HOPE for Homeowners. We tried all sorts of means by which we could slow down the foreclosure problem. Regretfully. we have not been as successful as we would like. There is no guarantee this will work as well as we would like either. I say that as a coauthor of this bill overall. and I appreciate my colleagues fine comments about the effort. But it is an attempt to try and provide some space. in these very delinquent mortgages. to provide an opportunity for a modification so people can stay in their homes. borrowers can keep their homes. lenders get something back. rather than going to foreclosure in which the implications for everyone are devastating. Again. the investor does not have an illegitimate complaint. but in the context of -balancing these interests. where. again. no one is going to come out of this perfect. in a way I think it is in our interest to try and do what we can to keep people in their homes and have the lenders be able to get something back. Hence. that is why you see this very unique coming together of various interest groups. from the consumer advocates to the major lending associations. saying on this point. they think this is the rightat least worthy of our attempt to get this right. Again. I respectfully say to my colleague from Tennessee. I appreciate.his points. He and I talked about this. But I honestly believe in this case this would be a mistake to accept this amendment and to run the risk of losing the opportunity to get that safe harbor opportunity. With that. I yield to my colleague from Florida.,111114091,DODD,CHRISTOPHER,S,CT,M,D,,voting,2009-05-05,19,Mr. DODD,477,689,05052009.txt,7230,1273,111,2009,mr presid see colleagu florida arriv take minut ask unanim consent recogn origin author safe harbor provis chanc explain point view let begin necessarili compel argument think worthi note organ oppos amend senat tennesse includ consum feder america nation commun law center nation associ consum advoc hous polici council financi roundtabl center respons lend mortgag insur corpor mortgag banker aba pretti rare collect get major consum group watch stuff care well major lend institut never come togeth anyth uniqu moment propos let say friend tennesse dont like situat either ideal world point contract valid one question point ed contract second home vacat home like well problem cramdown mortgag involv prohibit primari resid make except properti frankli taken durbin amend might minim import thie problem peopl day lose home day lose job question possibl get kind incent banker servic lender borrow modifi mortgag million home countri mortgag exce valu properti dont step soon number explod moratorium foreclosur certain area build backlog dont end mean borrow lender work arrang modifi mortgag face cascad effect peopl agre root caus financi difficulti begin predatori lend subprim lend help creat problem nodocument loan liar loan like craft rather narrow answer safe harbor provis broad frankli narrow senat martinez done propos talk loan privat label secur repres percent talk yet within percent excess percent loan serious delinqu loan rel small number compar total mortgag written term delinqu mortgag repres fairli signific major narrowli deal talk two circumst voluntarili move obama plan hope homeown limit peopl dont want requir tri remov one great barrier fear litig servic say would like understand valu want get paid bank want get paid borrow want stay home everybodi seem agre problem end modifi investor illegitim point say wait minut contract mr servic go modifi violat interest investor therefor go sue fear servic say go near respect fact borrow would like get situat afford mortgag would like get paid someth process go kind litig occur safe harbor henc martinez amend jn narrow circumst involv percent market percent delinqu mortgag two fact situat hope homeown obama mortgag modif plan provid safe harbor say servic fact move forward provid harbor avoid potenti litig case even frivol litig perfect world would like avoid friend tennesse want absolut perfect choic yet potenti danger dont like set preced narrowli defin time circumst involv alreadi occur problem die sunset decemb perpetu program limit fact situat limit opportun order tri provid relief primarili consum person hold mortgag person mortgag run risk lose home tri year half sort differ way friend tennesse former secretari hous urban develop senat martinez know someth issu recal tri spring get peopl togeth tri work thing promis would tri never draft legisl far perfect back today talk call hope homeown tri sort mean could slow foreclosur problem regret success would like guarante work well would like either say coauthor bill overal appreci colleagu fine comment effort attempt tri provid space delinqu mortgag provid opportun modif peopl stay home borrow keep home lender get someth back rather go foreclosur implic everyon devast investor illegitim complaint context balanc interest one go come perfect way think interest tri keep peopl home lender abl get someth back henc see uniqu come togeth variou interest group consum advoc major lend associ say point think least worthi attempt get right respect say colleagu tennesse point talk honestli believ case would mistak accept amend run risk lose opportun get safe harbor opportun yield colleagu florida,575,FALSE
1110064635,"Mr. President. our intelligence community should never be forced to question whether our priority is protecting Americas safety or protecting the privacy of terrorists. This bill makes clear to intelligence professionals that keeping our Nation safe is their highest responsibility and assures they have the tools needed to get the job done. That is why I am so pleased to join with my colleagues. Senators LIEBERMAN and SESSIONS. in reauthorizing three FISA provisionslone wolf. wiretap. and section 215which would otherwise expire. This legislation we have introduced today. without change. reauthorizes these three national vital security tools for 4 more years. While I believe each of these tools should be made permanent and Congress plays a dangerous game with national security every time we impose arbitrary sunsets. it is essential that the communitys ability to collect lifesaving foreign intelligence should continue unimpeded. Our bill also makes conforming changes to the disclosure requirements for national security letters in light of the Second Circuits decision last year. These issues are so critical and so urgent to our wellbeing and security as a nation. nothing else will matter. even the current health care debate. if we fail in national security. I have spoken before on this floor about the need for President Obama to make a decision about Afghanistan. I will not repeat those points today. But as our military. intelligence. and law enforcement professionals defend the United States and its allies in Washington. there is an effort afoot to make this fight much harder than it needs to be. The U.S. PATRIOT Act and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act were passed overwhelmingly in the aftermath of the September 11 terror attacks. For years. terrorism was treated as a law enforcement matter. Our Nation responded to terrorist attack after terrorist attack. to the deaths of our servicemembers and embassy personnel. with indictments and arrest warrants. As Congress failed to give our intelligence operators the tools they needed to act quickly. our terrorist enemies became even more emboldened and determined to strike our homeland. September 11 was a wakeup call. Our driving mission appropriately. after that. became prevention and disruption of terrorist attacks at home against our troops overseas and against our allies. That is why the legislation we passed provided the necessary tools. In 2005. the PATRIOT Act was reauthorized with minor changes. but three FISA provisions remained subject to sunset. Here is an opportunity for us to reauthorize these three vital provisions. There is little disagreement among people who know that these provisions should and must be reauthorized. FBI Director Mueller testified before the Judiciary Committee that each is important to the FBIs work in national security and criminal investigation. But because of the enhanced information sharing rules and procedures. other community entities. such as the Counterterrorism Center. are often dependent upon information collected under these authorities. Their loss would adversely impact their ability to analyze and share important national intelligence information. As an example. if the FBI obtains a court order under FISA for a roving wiretap targeting a terrorist subject in New York. foreign intelligence information obtained there may be shared with the CIA. enabling them in turn to target associates overseas. Events over the past few months underscore the importance of giving the FBI and other agencies all the tools and authorities they need to stay ahead. From the disrupted terror plots in New York and Colorado to those in Illinois. Texas. and North Carolina. we have seen firsthand why the FBI must have the flexibility to get the information they need as quickly as possible to prevent these attacks. The benefit of our intelligence collection authorities. however. does not just benefit our own citizens. Just as overseas terror threats may impact our safety. threats posed by some within our country do not always end here. We learned two men in Chicago were conspiring with associates to commit terrorist attacks in Denmark. This case is a good example of how FISA authorities can save lives in allied countries. There is a belief among some that as long as the intelligence community eventually gets the information it needs. time is not of the essence. That is not true. Timing was everything. whether it was introducing an undercover agent to a target at the right moment or conducting surveillance at the right time. No intelligence collector is going to say that getting the same information 3 weeks later is good enough. I cannot comment on specific tools that were used in foiling all of these plots. We know both from public and classified testimony and information that the tools provided that we are authorizing today have been invaluable to our efforts to stay ahead of the terrorists. As I mentioned earlier. the FBIs ability to obtain a roving wiretap under FISA will end this year unless Congress acts. According to Director Mueller. the FBI has used the authority 140 times in the past 5 years. The ability to track terrorists even when they repeatedly use and dump their cell phones to avoid interception is. as Director Mueller testified. ""tremendously important."" He also noted with all the new technology. it is nothing for a target to buy four or five cell phones and use them in quick succession. I couldnt agree more. Our enemies know our laws better than some of us do. They understand the hoops and hurdles government must clear to catch up or stay ahead. Roving wiretap authority sends a clear message that the timehonored trick of frequently changing a cell phone will not work like it used to. Obtaining a roving wiretap requires. first and foremost. that the FBI establish probable cause that the target is an agent of a foreign power. Some critics of this provision claim it allows the FBI to avoid meeting this standard as surveillance moves from phone to phone. That is not true. Each wiretap application is approved by a FISA Court judge. If a target changes his cell phone and the FBI moves to surveil the new phone. the court is notified. All of the protections for U.S. person information that apply to any other FISA wiretap also apply to roving wiretaps. In short. while the authority is a tremendous asset for the FBI. it poses no additional civil liberties concerns. It should be renewed. On business records. over the past 5 years. a rallying cry against these measures has centered on section 215. allowing the FBI to obtain business records such as hotel information or travel records upon a showing of the requisite burden of proof to a FISA Court judge. We have heard time and again the FBI is using this authority to spy on peoples reading habits at the local library. This is simply highly charged rhetoric not supported by facts. While the FBI has used section 215 more than 250 times in the past 5 years. no library records have been obtained. But we do know that terrorists and their associates have used library Internet access to communicate with each other and. in the appropriate case. the FBI must have the ability to obtain any relevant records relating to that usage. Congress should not pass any legislation that would allow terrorists to use libraries or any other public facility as a safe haven for their illegal activities. If we did that. guess where all the terrorists would congregate. Do you want them all in your libraries? I dont think so. The inspector general of the Department of Justice conducted several audits of the FBIs use of section 215 and found no abuse of authority. These audits also considered the time it takes for the FBI to obtain a 215 order. The Director has testified that business records sought by terrorism investigations by the FBI are ""absolutely essential to identifying other persons who may be involved in terrorist activities."" The records obtained under this authority are no different from what the FBI could obtain in a criminal investigation using grand jury subpoena authority. There is rarely any delay in obtaining a grand jury subpoena. DOJ should strive to ensure that section 215 court orders are obtained in a timely and expedient manner. Given the vital information that can be obtained. I have asked the DOJ to take steps necessary to minimize future delays. As with roving wiretap authority. I believe section 215 has adequate measures already built in to ensure that the private interests of U.S. persons are protected. I have not heard any reasonable critique of this authority. and I believe it should be authorized without changes. without delay. The sole expiring provision that has not been used by the FBI is the lone wolf definition of an agent of a foreign power. prompting some critics to demand its repeal. Under this definition. the FBI can obtain a FISA Act search or electronic surveillance against a nonU.S. person who is not readily identifiable with a particular foreign power. We all should be familiar with the story of Zacarias Moussaoui. the 9/11 coconspirator who was identified prior to the 9/11 attacks. But the FBI could not connect him with a particular terrorist organization and. therefore. did not submit a formal request for a FISA search order. We know Moussaoui was ultimately convicted in the Eastern District of Virginia and is now serving a life sentence for his part in the 9/11 conspiracy. If FISA had included a lone wolf provision. the FBI could have searched his belongings and possibly gained advanced intelligence about the 9/11 plot. Once again. Director Mueller has emphasized in his recent testimony that the FBI must retain the ability to target an individual who cannot be specifically tied to a particular foreign power. The Director specifically cited the Moussaoui case as a prime example. We should never again take the risk that another Moussaoui will be identified by the FBI but escape scrutiny to prevent an attack because he could not be tied to a specific terrorist organization. I see the ""lone wolf"" provision as a necessary tool that will only need to be used in limited circumstances. It is kind of like those ""in case of emergency. break glass"" boxes that cover certain fire alarms and equipment. We need to keep these tools available for the rare situations where they would be needed. As I mentioned earlier. the Senate Judiciary Committee reported a PATRIOT Act reauthorization bill that makes a number of changes to section 215 authorities and other national security tools. I believe the Judiciary bill is deeply flawed. and I hope my colleagues will listen carefully and support our bill instead. There will be ample time down the road to lay out in detail all my objections to the Judiciary bill. but let me just make a few key points. I disagree strongly that there should be a first time ever sunset for national security letters. It is irresponsible to risk letting the law revert back to pre9/11 status. where NSLs were largely underutilized because the burden of proof and approval levels were too high for an investigative tool. The socalled abuses that are so often cited were actually related to something called exigent letters. Exigent letters are essentially a request to third parties. usually phone companies or Internet service providers. for immediate access to records. contingent upon a promise to provide a grand jury subpoena or a national security letter promptly. It is important to understand that these exigent letters are not national security letters or grand jury subpoenas. While there is statutory authority for carriers to voluntarily provide the FBI with the contents of the communication if the carrier has a goodfaith belief that an emergency involving death or serious physical injury requires disclosure of the communication without delay. the DOJ IG found that these exigent letter requests were issued on a routine. rather than an exigent. basis. Interestingly. the people relying on the now corrected exigent letter problem to justify their proposed restrictions on NSLs are not calling for similar restrictions to be placed on grand jury subpoenas. They know better than to try that because there would be immediate and overwhelming objections from the Department of Justice and nearly every U.S. attorney in the country. We cannot go back to pre9/11 days. when national security investigative techniques were significantly more difficult to use than ordinary criminal investigative techniques. Setting aside the problems with the exigent letters. I have said. time and time again. that the errors identified by the DOJ IG were almost exclusively administrative. The FBI has acted quickly to correct these errors. and we should not respond by hamstringing their investigations. I also disagree with requiring minimization procedures for both pen registers/trapandtrace devices and NSLs. The FBI has been clear about the operational harm that will likely result if minimization procedures are required for the type of preliminary data. such as telephone toll records. obtained by these tools. Aside from the basic problem of how the FBI would even go about minimizing this type of information. I do not see why it is necessary. We certainly would never impose these types of restrictions on grand jury subpoenas or other types of administrative subpoenas. Supporters claim we need minimization procedures to protect U.S. persons. but they conveniently overlook the fact that the records we are talking about here are in the hands of third parties and are not entitled to the same type of protections that other information is subject to. The constitutional protections were discussed in Smith v. Maryland. and the Supreme Court held we simply do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to these sorts of thirdparty records. Ironically. because the FBI cannot tell from the type of information obtained by these tools if someone is a U.S. person. they would actually have to do more investigation and be more intrusive before figuring out whether the information should be minimized. Finally. I have significant concerns about the change the Judiciary Committee bill makes to the notification period for sneakandpeak search warrantsdown from 30 to 7 days. These warrants. which are approved by a court upon a finding of probable cause. are an important tool in drug and certain terrorism cases. We know from the FBIand I am sure if we asked the DEA. they would agreethat 7 days is not enough time before giving a target notice that a search was carried out. In a terrorism investigation. likely involving many overseas associates and evidence. it is unreasonable to have to disclose the investigation within a week. when other activities connected to that may be just beginning to be collected. Depending on the type of information recovered from a search. testing and analysis may not even be done within 7 days. Are we going to risk blowing these investigations because of a random conclusion that 30 days is too long? I understand the government can ask for more time after the 7 days. but we do not have unlimited resources. We should not make our law enforcement agencies jump through more hoops when a court has already found that a search is proper in the first place. I have other concerns about this bill. including the wisdom of a separate standard for library records. which I view as an even greater invitation for terrorists to use libraries to communicate with each other. and new reporting and auditing requirements. I have to wonder what additional administrative burdens these requirements will put on the FBI at the same time they are trying to focus on preventing and disrupting further attacks on our Nation. Because of the significant operational concerns raised by the Judiciary Committees bill. I believe that it should not be considered by the full Senate until the Intelligence Committeeas a wholehas had the opportunity to consider its implications for our national security. after hearing from Director Mueller about the impact of this entire bill on FBI operations. There are many issues about the Judiciary billboth classified and unclassifiedthat need to be addressed. The best venue in which to do that is the Intelligence Committee. Dont forget that three of the five crossover members from the Intelligence Committee voted against the Judiciary Committee bill. I would hardly call that a ringing endorsement. I believe full consideration by the Intelligence Committee would greatly improve the measures we will be acting on. on the floor. Unfortunately. my efforts to give the Intelligence Committee the opportunity to weigh in on the Judiciary bill have thus far been unsuccessful. But at the same time. we cannot risk letting these crucial authorities lapse. For that reason. I have decided to cosponsor the legislation we are introducing today because. under this bill. I can categorically state it will have no provision that will have an adverse impact on intelligence community activities or operations. It is not insignificant. in my opinion. that the bill we are introducing today is cosponsored by the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. and by me. as vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee. Each of these committees has a role to play in safeguarding our domestic security. Chairman LIEBERMAN. Ranking Member SESSIONS. and I all understand the stakes in failing to reauthorize these expiring provisions are high. The stakes in adding new and flawed provisions or creating unreasonable burdens are just as high. It serves no legitimate purpose to give the FBI or any other law enforcement or intelligence agency tools that are rendered ineffective because Congress imposes arbitrary conditions without fully appreciating their ramifications. The sponsorship of this legislation is also noteworthy because it sends a clear and loud message that giving our law enforcement intelligence professionals the authorities and tools they need to keep the country safe is not and should not be a partisan issue. In the last Congress. we saw firsthand the negative impact of partisanship and pandering to extreme special interests. The FISA Amendments Act was supported by a strong bipartisan margin out of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Unfortunately. as the bill wound its way through the Senate and eventually the House. it became a political football. As a result. we came too close for comfort to losing the intelligence collection authorities we had worked hard to preserve. I am hopeful we can avoid similar partisanship and political interests to take over what should be a straightforward legislative process. The surest way of doing that is to pass the bill we introduce today. For years. we have hammered away at the notion that there should be walls between criminal and national security investigations. We have embraced the idea that the same tools that are used to capture drug dealers and child molesters should be available to track terrorists and spies. While the idea has been generally accepted. the execution has been lacking. Our laws still impose unnecessary divisions between administrative and grand jury subpoena authority and national security letters. Those divisions are exacerbated by the Judiciary Committee bill. which imposes new unheard of requirements on national security letters and the FISA pen register/trapandtrace information. Over the past 8 years. Congress has placed heavy demands on the FBI to be a full participant in the intelligence community. While the transportation has not been without some hiccups. they have come a long way since the days leading up to 9/11. when the word ""FISA"" was foreign to much of the rank and file FBI. Now is not the time to saddle them with additional administrative burdens or to impose conditions on the use of certain tools so drastic they become useless. There are so many current and clearcut examples of domestic terror threats before us. I have to wonder why anyone thinks this would be a good time to experiment with the vital authorities used to keep us safe. The legislation we are introducing today will ensure our intelligence and law enforcement professionals can continue doing what they do best. without any additional restrictions. Our Nation has been fortunate not to have suffered a sequel to the 9/11 attacks. Some may call it luck. but much of the credit goes to the dedicated work of our intelligence and law enforcement professionals and the availability of these tools that we are reauthorizing in this bill. We owe our thanks to the personnel who use them. We also owe them the recognition that their jobs are as difficult as they are. and we should not be taking any steps that will make their profound responsibility to protect this country any more difficult. That is why I urge my colleagues to support this measure. I thank my cosponsor and our lead sponsor. Mr. President.

1110018495,"You know. it was just last week that the Wall Street Journal reported the estimate that the premium would be an additional 2 percent on a mortgage. Thats what the cost would be if this cramdown legislation goes through. So if someone qualifies for a 6 percent mortgage. now they would be looking at an 8 percent mortgage. What that does is it takes scores of people out of being able to qualify for a mortgage. just adding to the cost. And for what? Over 92 percent of all Americans are responsible. Theyre"" working. Theyre paying their mortgages on time. And when you look at the trillions and trillion.9 and trillions of dollars that have been thrown at this housing problem. and you have 92 percent of Americans paying their mortgages on time. when you look at these tens of trillions of dollars now that are being thrown at this. I think we could probably be paying those mortgages off. multiple times. of the people who were in trouble. -It is so much money. It is so unfathomable.

1110073433,"Mr. Speaker. in the rush of a debate in an earlier 1minute. I was not able to capture the somberness of the moment. As our colleagues have finished their work and have. in fact. recognized the need of this Nation. I think it is important to summarize how important it is to keep our minds focused as we return back in the new year. We know that this country is a resilient country. People are tough. and theyve gotten tougher. We are blessed by the fact that we have a country of laws. Were a democratic Nation. If there is oppression in our Nation. we have a court system to seek to be redeemed. We have the amenities of life. technology. transportation. clean water. But in every country comes a time when things are not as good as they need to be. and I think we should clarify what has been done over these last couple of months. I was here during the past two Presidential terms. When I say ""two Presidential terms."" the past and former Presidents. I voted for the 1997 Budget Reconciliation Act that generated an enormous surplus and created an opportunity for millions of our children to be insured. That was 1997. We had a surplus as that previous administration. the Clinton administration. left office. We had a tragedy on 9/11. and we had to respond to that enormous tragedy. a terrorist act. and I joined with my colleagues to respond to that by allowing our Nation to defend itself by going into Afghanistan. I did not support the detour into Iraq. However. I support the men and women. and I mourn for those families who have lost loved ones. So what have we done over this year? We have fought for America. and that is why there was the political sacrifice. Some people say thats your job. to vote for the TARPnot willingly. We didnt want a fatcat bill. We didnt want a bill that paid people to stuff their pockets. We wanted to ensure that businesses stayed open. that we had the opportunity for small businesses. my friends and neighbors. my constituents to get money to keep those jobs. All right. it wasnt perfect. but the numbers dont fib. We did create jobs. We kept businesses open. The President has gone to the mat by saying to these fat cats. Look. we are in a capitalistic system. I understand that. But hes gone to them and said. You have to lend to small businesses. Mr. Speaker. we have done a lot. And in doing a lot. we have provided the opportunity for the kinds of dollars coming to the districts. So let me just say this: $48 billion in highways. transit and other infrastructure. We are going to be able to stop the bleeding by keeping our teachers. our police. our firefighters and job training. Thats $27 billion. We are going to guarantee the loans. guarantee loans to ensure that we will have the opportunity to loan money to our small businesses. Thats an important statement. And I wanted to be sure by looking at what I have to let my constituents know of the kind of projects that come out of the Defense bill. Because someone would make the argument. why support a Defense bill? Let me tell you. Ive already spoken about the first posttraumatic stress disorder center in an African American hospital for $1 million. $800.000 for the Center for Research on Minority HealthProstate Cancer research project. jobs. $800.000 for highefficiency solar energy generation and storage. jobs. $1.6 million for science. technology. engineering and mathematics initiative. jobs. And then $1 million with a private collaborator that is independent of Federal dollars that will give $1 million to one of the poorest school districts in my community. public and private partnership. Mr. Speaker. Let us not leave this place in shame. We came from the deep darkness of an economic recession. We have saved jobs. We are creating jobs. We are moving forward. And I want to stop reading articles about mothers who are on the front pages of our newspapers who cannot turn on the lights and cannot feed their children.

1110035399,"Mr. Speaker. there are two very good reasons to vote ""no"" on this bill. This bill is called the hate crimes bill. "" The first major reason to vote ""no"" is that this bill increases hared in America. I will say it again. This bill increases hatred in America. How does that happen? It can be easily illustrated. Lets say that youre a parent and that you have a number of children but that you dont give the children equal laws. Some you favor and some you dont. What quicker formula to create animosity between children? This law violates the most basic principle of law. Lady Justice is always supposed to have a blindfold across her face because. regardless of who you are when you appear before Lady Justicewhether youre black or white. male or female. rich or poor. fat or skinnyLady Justice does not notice. This bill violates that basic principle. It creates animosity by elevating one group over another group. thus. it creates hatred. This is counter to everything American law has ever stood for. and it will increase hatred in America. For that reason alone. there should be a vote of ""no."" A second good reason to vote ""no"" on this bill is that .our courts have a large backlog of various cases. Our judges and juries have to take a look at a certain set of facts and must determine whether or not somebody did or did not do something that is specifically illegal in the law. This law says that now were going to try and turn them all into psychologists and have them figure out whether the criminals had good attitudes or not when they did the crimes.

1110069891,amendment would preserve the clearing exemption but impose an execution mandate on end users. the idea being that the more swaps that can go through a swap execution facility. the greater price transparency you receive. the better deal an end user can make. In theory. this all makes sense. however. the end user community doesnt buy it. They question whether the price information that will come out of the swap execution facility will actually be beneficial to them. and they also know that there will be costs to bear because the facilities wont perform this service for nothing. End users dont know whether the benefits will outweigh the costs. I have a real problem telling people that are in the business whats good for them when they dont believe it.

1110034840,I thank the gentleman. And just to add to that. I know when I got elected in 1992 to the Florida Legislature. I had a group of people in south Florida that said single payer. thats the way to go. These are mostly senior citizens who thought that was just the best opportunity. Most of the doctors I was talking to who I knew in the community at that time were totally against that. Well. whats happened now is many of my doctors in our community. who do just wonderful service. are now the ones saying Medicare seems to pay quicker. more efficiently than a lot of the managed care organizations. And Im not picking on managed care as a whole. There are some that are good and some that are more difficult to deal with. But I think the point of this all is that Medicare has generally worked fairly well. I think most seniors are pretty satisfied with a lot of things. Its not perfect. but I think that we understand that. But if we think about. you know. what is it that. again. recognizing the different pieces here. We have a lot of people that retire to Florida. where I live. preMedicare. 55. 58. 59 years old. Maybe theyre in businessor work for some government up in the northern part of the country or from some other part of the country. and all of a sudden they dont have health care that transfers to- Florida. and they cant buy health care because of a preexisting condition or any number of other things. So what some of them have said is. why arent we allowed to buy into Medicare on our dime? No government subsidy. just allow us to pay whatever the premium would be. And thats a very interesting idea. I think. again. just trying to think outside of the box. and theres not one silver bullet thats going to solve all .these things. There may be some ideas for us to consider. And another idea is. a lot of small businesses. we know that we like the idea of small businesses pooling their 12 employees here and 16 employees there. and 5 employees here. and 80 there to get to the larger critical mass so they can spread the risk again. Better price. better service. spreading the risk. Why not allow those small businesses to buy into our State health care system or the Federal. you know. the employees for the Federal Government. again. on their dime. But we already know. we did some pricing on this. and the cost is far below what the private insurance companies would charge them. So. you know. there are a lot of ideas out here. And I think what we really need to be doing right now is asking Americans. and all of us. as Democrats and Republicans in our Chamber here. ask Americans. what do you think is the right thing?

1110022220,Mr. President. I rise to express my outrage that at a time of economic crisis in our Nation and around the world. at a time when so many Americans are losing jobs. defaulting on homes. and falling behind in their own payments. they are paying into a system doling out multimilliondollar bonuses to employees at AIG. Many of the same employees receiving these lavish payouts are the same ones who brought their company to the edge of collapse and the economy into the depths of recession. We cannot let their actions be rewardedexcessively rewardedwith the multimilliondollar bonuses paid by the taxpayers. Time and again. we have gone back to our constituents and asked them to sacrifice to make ends meet. Now we demand the corporate executives do the same. As American families struggle to balance their own checkbooks at kitchen tables all across America. the employees of AIG walk out of their offices with $165 million in bonuses so far and are on track to take home an estimated $450 million by the end of this yearfree money that they did not earn and certainly do not deserve. It is now time for those executives who. through their reckless greed and irresponsible actions. have jeopardized our economic security to share the burden in rebuilding this economy. If this company and others like it fail to recognize the outrage and the frivolous nature of these taxpayerfunded bonuses. Congress will intervene and act on their behalf. Yesterday. I joined my Democratic colleagues in sending a letter to the CEO of AIG. Edward Liddy. We asked that Mr. Liddy take a reasonable look at these excessive bonuses and requested. that he act to renegotiate them. We also warned that if he chooses not to act immediately. we will take action to recoup the American taxpayers money through punitive legislation. Chairman BAUCUS has signaled he is poised to move forward with legislation that he and Senators GRASSLEY. WYDEN. and SNOWE are drafting to allow the Government to recoup this money for taxpayers by subjecting the bonuses to severe tax penalties. At the same time we are correcting the payouts of the past. we have been working with the current administration to put in place new standards of accountability for the future. As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act we passed last month. we asked the treasury Department to establish new guidelines regarding executive pay and luxuries. Just last week. we reiterated the urgency in a second letter to the Treasury Department asking that they swiftly complete this project and announce these new standards. In addition to these steps. let us resolve to work in partnership with the Obama administration and the Senate Banking Committee to take up a strong Wall Street accountability bill as soon as possible. Our responsibilities lie with the citizens we represent. If we are successful in taming the greed of Wall Street. we will have gone a long way to safeguarding the economic interests of those we represent and those for whom we workthe people of the United States of America.

1110000800,"Mr. President. today marks the 50th anniversary of Senator ROBERT BYRDS service to this most American of institutions: the United States Senate. ""Service to the Senate""-I have chosen these words intentionally. and with care. To serve in this hallowed chamber is to meld service to home andcommunity with service to the Nation as a whole. It is a distinction that we are all privileged to share. But through his five decades in this Chamber. ROBERT BYRDs service has transcended the ordinary to rise to the absolute allegiance our country has only rarely received over her long history. Senator BYRD was born and raised in humble circumstances. The loss of his mother at the age of 1 left him a virtual orphan. and he grew up in West Virginias coal country. The Great Depression postponed the young ROBERT BYRDs education. but it did nothing to hold back his lively and agile mind or his passion to seize on Americas promise of equal opportunity. In 1946. he entered West Virginias House of Delegates. and sought progressively higher offices. Finally. in 1958. he arrived in the Senate and found his ""home."" It is said that education opens doors. but in Senator BYRDs case. we learn that the doors it opens may not be the ones that we expect. For him. he was already a Member of the House of Representatives when he began work to earn his J.D. Ten years of night school finally earned him the degree as a sitting Senator. So what doors did his studies open? After all. he was already one of the Nations highest officials. Education. a love of history. the discipline of rigorous study. the independence of thought. If you think about it. these are the very qualities that our American democracy most depends on. And by cultivating them.

1110005208,"Mr. Speaker. had been speaking about during the initial part of this hour. These are very important things. as he talked about the recent passage of the expanded reauthorization of the SCHIP program. the State Childrens Health Insurance Program. what I am referencing. and brought out the fact that there were so many things in that reauthorization and expansion over the next 42 years that caused Dr. BURGESS and myself and many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle to vote ""no"" on something that. quite honestly. we really had hoped to be able to vote ""yes"" because this idea that was originated back in 1997 for this legislation to help families who are not poor enough to be eligible for Medicaid. And that is at 100 percent of the Federal poverty level. about $22.000. $23.000 a year for a family of four. They are not below that level of income. but yet not making enough money to really be able to afford to provide health insurance for their children. So that is what the original SCHIP bill was all about it. It was authorized for 10 years. it was a $40 billion bill. as I recall. and it would cover those children whose family income was above 100.000 but under 200.000. So you are talking about $44.000. $45.000 a year for a family of four. And. clearly. providing health insurance on that kind of income is a strain. is a struggle. and of course many of those youngsters were not insured. So the program was good. and of course it expired. It was time for reauthorization. Former President Bush realized that more money needed to be appropriated for this program. There were a significant number of children. maybe as many as 2 million or 3 million. that were not being covered who were in that income category. their family income. between 100 and 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. And I certainly was in favor of a 25 percent. 30 percent. maybe even a 40 percent expansion of the program to make sure that we reached as close as possible to a 100 percent saturation level. Mr. Speaker. and my colleagues. for those children. I think everyone on both sides of the aisle would agree that that clearly needs to be done. But. unfortunately. for some reason the Democratic majority wanted to expand this program. When you extrapolate from the 4/ year amount of expenditure to.a 10year program. it would be a 100 percent increase in the amount of funding. The thing about it is that there are things in the bill that allowed the abuses that existed to continue and even worsening that situation. And I want. Mr. Speaker. to mention a couple of those. because I think it is very important for people to understand why a physician member of this body. indeed two right here on the floor this evening. who delivered babies as a profession. brought little children into the world. would vote against this program. And here are some of the reasons: One of the changes in the reauthorization said that no longer would an immigrant have to have a 5year waiting period before they would become eligible. Well. indeed. our immigration laws have been on the books for a long time. They get changed periodically. But in the last significant change of immigration law. it basically said: We dont want to have a magnet here in this country and to say to everybody across the world. come one. come all. to come to this country and get on the government dole. the freebies. No. that is not the reason we want immigrants to come to the country. We want them to come. to assimilate into our society. to contribute to our society. to. yes. enjoy the American dream. But that provision says that as a legal person comes into this country. they have to have a sponsor. They have to have someone who is willing to say that that wont happen. that they will not become a ward of the state. certainly not within 5 years. So this reauthorization says: Oh. no. we are going to do away with that. States dont have to abide by that anymore. They can spend SCHIP money on someone that has been here 6 months. Even worse than that. Mr. Speaker. is the provision in regard to illegals. It says specifically in the language of the bill that no illegal immigrant is eligible. but yet. then it goes on to say that the verification system for an immigrant. whether or not they are here legally. is so watered down that it is almost like a wink and a nod to say. ""Come on. it is okay. All you have to do is give a ninedigit number for your Social Security number. You dont have to show a Social Security card. but you have to give a number. Yeah. that is nine digits. you are eligible."" These kind of things were bad enough. but I want to point out something else. Mr. Speaker. and that is a little game that some States I think 13 or 14. and my colleagues are aware of this. a little game that some States have been using to disregard. to actually disregard blocks of income. to say. ""Oh. you are making 350 percent of the Federal poverty level. So you wouldnt normally be eligible. but we are just going to simply not count that money that your parents have earned above 200 percent. We are not going to count that. We are just going to simply disregard it."" And they are getting away with that. And so in some States there are indeed. and it will continue. that children of families making up to 350 percent of the Federal poverty level. I think we are talking now about $80.000 a year for a family of four. where they can indeed afford to pay for private health insurance for their children. and they are insured in many instances. So naturally. if they get an opportunity like this. a onceinalifetime opportunity to drop that private coverage and get on the freebie government trough. who wouldnt? Well. I wouldnt. But a lot of people would and a lot of people did and do. So I had an amendment. a very straightforward amendment that said we are going to end the shenanigans of income disregard both for the Medicaid program and for the SCHIP program. Why would I want to do that. Mr. Speaker? I would want to do it so that those children who truly have the need. for whom the program was designed. for who we are willing to spend taxpayer money. that they get coverage. and it doesnt go to the upper middle income who clearly dont need it. So there are a lot of little things that I could go on. on that. but I know that we have got others who want to speak tonight on health care and I want to make sure there is plenty of time for others. And hopefully during the hour. time permitting. I would like to come back to some of the other issues that Dr. BURGESS was talking about. Mr. Speaker. in regard to this economic stimulus package that we are about to vote on tomorrow and why I think that it is not going to work. I wish it would work. I hope and pray that it does work. But I have grave misgivings about it. and I would like to have an opportunity lat6r on in the hour to discuss that further. as I know that my colleagues will. also.",111118770,BURGESS,MICHAEL,H,TX,M,R,26,voting,2009-01-26,285,Dr. BURGESS,20150,20354,01262009.txt,6933,1281,111,2009,mr speaker speak initi part hour import thing talk recent passag expand reauthor schip program state children health insur program referenc brought fact mani thing reauthor expans next year caus dr burgess mani colleagu side aisl vote someth quit honestli realli hope abl vote ye idea origin back legisl help famili poor enough elig medicaid percent feder poverti level year famili four level incom yet make enough money realli abl afford provid health insur children origin schip bill author year billion bill recal would cover children whose famili incom talk year famili four clearli provid health insur kind incom strain struggl cours mani youngster insur program good cours expir time reauthor former presid bush realiz money need appropri program signific number children mayb mani million million cover incom categori famili incom percent feder poverti level certainli favor percent percent mayb even percent expans program make sure reach close possibl percent satur level mr speaker colleagu children think everyon side aisl would agre clearli need done unfortun reason democrat major want expand program extrapol year amount expenditur toa year program would percent increas amount fund thing thing bill allow abus exist continu even worsen situat want mr speaker mention coupl think import peopl understand physician member bodi inde two right floor even deliv babi profess brought littl children world would vote program reason one chang reauthor said longer would immigr year wait period would becom elig well inde immigr law book long time get chang period last signific chang immigr law basic said dont want magnet countri say everybodi across world come one come come countri get govern dole freebi reason want immigr come countri want come assimil societi contribut societi ye enjoy american dream provis say legal person come countri sponsor someon will say wont happen becom ward state certainli within year reauthor say oh go away state dont abid anymor spend schip money someon month even wors mr speaker provis regard illeg say specif languag bill illeg immigr elig yet goe say verif system immigr whether legal water almost like wink nod say come okay give ninedigit number social secur number dont show social secur card give number yeah nine digit elig kind thing bad enough want point someth els mr speaker littl game state think colleagu awar littl game state use disregard actual disregard block incom say oh make percent feder poverti level wouldnt normal elig go simpli count money parent earn percent go count go simpli disregard get away state inde continu children famili make percent feder poverti level think talk year famili four inde afford pay privat health insur children insur mani instanc natur get opportun like onceinalifetim opportun drop privat coverag get freebi govern trough wouldnt well wouldnt lot peopl would lot peopl amend straightforward amend said go end shenanigan incom disregard medicaid program schip program would want mr speaker would want children truli need program design will spend taxpay money get coverag doesnt go upper middl incom clearli dont need lot littl thing could go know got other want speak tonight health care want make sure plenti time other hope hour time permit would like come back issu dr burgess talk mr speaker regard econom stimulu packag vote tomorrow think go work wish would work hope pray work grave misgiv would like opportun hour discuss know colleagu also,555,FALSE

1110075517,"I thank the Senator from Missouri for his comments. He has been chairman of the Small Business Committee. Small business plays a huge role. the biggest role. in the economy of the United States. We could have. and we should have. spent the last 4 weeks talking about what needed to be done with small business. It is a big issue and it is important. I appreciate the emphasis the Senator from Missouri has put on it through the years. I want to talk about the whole bill today. because a quote I ran into was that ""absolute power corruptsabsolutely."" The Democrats have absolute power right now. Under the biggest requirement for votes. it only takes 60 in the Senate. The Democrats have 60 votes. In the House. they have a clear majority of the votes. and that is all that is required to pass a bill there. They are under the impression that they won the election. so they get to write the bills. Never before has that happened on a major piece of legislation. Everyone in this country should be upset when the majority refers to bills like ending slavery and civil rights and Medicare and welfare reform and paint the Republicans as the opposition. Substantial numbers on both sides of the aisle made those bills possible. I am pretty sure people remember that it was Lincoln. a Republican. who led the fight to abolish slavery. Leader Mansfield gives Everett Dirksen. a Republican from Illinois. credit for the leadership that made the civil rights bill possible. In every instance. until now. Republicans have had a leadership role and both sides have substantially participated in making and voting for those laws. In politics. that is how it has to work for our country to be successful. Only one party. and especially one person. ""gains"" from this socalled health care reform bill. The President will be able to show how he was able to accomplish something against all odds. Why against all odds? Because the Democrats of the Senate wrote off the 40 votes of the Republicans. That is right. we were written off from the start. Oh. yes. we were allowed to participate to see if we couldnt be persuaded to take what the Democrats wanted to write and foist on America. Anything short of buying the whole Democratic plan and we could be and would be thrown overboard because our votes arent needed. We were thrown overboard with the excuse of phony time deadlines. when it was needing to do just the Democratic ideas. Senator Kennedy and I were able to work through an incredible number of bills because we recognized that both sides had good ideas and both sides had bad ideas. The trick was to take as many of the good ideas as possible and have the courage to tell some on both sides that their idea wasnt ready for prime time. With evenhandedness and both leaders promoting the surviving ideas. many of the bills were unanimous on both ends of the building. Were there flaws in some of the bills? Yes. No bill is perfect. On the simplest solutions. nobody. particularly those who have never been involved in that business or that area. can comprehend all of the unintended consequences. But when it is both parties acting in concert. when problems come up. solutions are sought. When bills are done by one partyand no allencompassing bill has been done this way ever beforewhen the bills are done by one party. those inevitable flaws result in justified finger pointing. You cant change such a basic part of the economysomething that affects every single personby ignoring many who have experience in the business and in the area and not expect major flaws. The American people even recognize the flawsalready. Of course. everybody has some knowledge of health care. since it affects us all. When those flaws develop. and they will. in an avalanche. everybody will point to one party. the Democratic party. and say why did you have to prove your power? Why didnt you work to get it right? Why did you have to polarize the issue to show you were the only ones concerned about people? Of course. the Republicans will be compelled to pull out the proof that we warned about the flaws but were ignored. because the Democrats are focused on proving that they won the election. Normally. there is plenty of blame to go around. but not on this one. The Republicans were thrown overboard. That only left the 60 votes needed to pass the bill. Well. you cannot get 60 people to agree on 100 percent of anything. You could not get 60 people to agree on a place to eat dinner. But all 60 had to agree. That is where you have to move away from legislating and into dealmaking. That is when you have to start playing games like ""Lets Make a Deal"" or ""The Price is Right."" I dont want to downplay how masterful the leader was. Everyone has to be in awe of his ability to give much to a few and none to many and get 100 percent to stay on what they can see from the polls is a sinking ship. How can a person discriminate between Members. between States? Usually. we do earmarks in appropriations bills. Now we are starting to do them in policy bills. Why? To buy votes. The leader is buying votes with taxpayer money for things the majority of the taxpayers will never benefit from. I dont have time to go into the way the groups have made hidden deals for this bill. such as the American Medical Association and big pharmaceuticals. I dont have time to talk about how taxes will go up and premiums will be up. As an accountant in the Senate. you are going to be shocked by the numbersbut not until it is too late. I dont have time to explain to you how the Democrats are planning to spend the same money twice. That is a pretty neat trick. too. I dont have time to explain how the government will tell you what the minimum amount of insurance is. It is more insurance than most Americans have right now. If you dont find a way to buy this better package. there will be fines for you to pay. If the government can force you to buy insurance and force you to buy what Washington thinks is the best. what is next? Will they be able to tell you what kind of car to buy? Remember. the government now owns a car company. I hope I have time to remind you we all agree that Medicare is going broke. But this bill takes almost $500 billion of Medicare money and uses it to do new programsnew programs outside of Medicarethat will go on forever and need money forever. even after Medicare is broke. They even recognize the problem and form a commission to tell us where to cut Medicare. That is so they can shift the blame to a commission. But the difficulty is they have made special deals that take away the commissions ability to make cutsexcept to the benefits of seniors. They are the only ones left standing. There will have to be cutsreal cuts. They made a deal. I saw a letter from those who said they support the bill. For a while. they had a whole years worth of change in their pay. Now they have 2 months where they will be paid what they think is less than adequate but OK to stay in business. Evidently. they think that even though the Senate turned it down. because they couldnt afford to pay for it. $250 billion in adjustments to what they get paid because it wasnt paid for. and we are going to come back and do that without it being paid for. It could have been paid for out of the Medicare money if they were using it for Medicare only.

1110053902,Madam Speaker. I stand here to speak on this bill. I have some misgivings about it. But I intend to vote for this bill. I cant vote against this bill because it benefits people that have served this country and that have suffered for this country. And I have never. in the 28 years I have been here. voted for a bill that affected adversely any veteran or any person that stood up- for this country. and I admire and respect Mr. SKELTON. the author of this bill. I disagree with the way he has funded it and want to point that out. I would also point out that I have a letter addressed to Mr. SKELTON. He has not had the time to receive it because this bill was introduced yesterday. and it is on the floor today. That is a little hasty. But this is an important bill. and it is a bill that needs to be passed. But Im torn today as I rise to speak on H.R. 2990. On the one hand. I support the revisions in the bill. retired pay benefits for Reserve members and compensation and benefits for servicemembers. But where Im torn is how the chairman. my good friend. Mr. SKELTON. chose to pay for the compensation and benefits provided under the bill. * I will first pointout that this is a bill for the veterans. and this is a bill for those that probably without this bill would not have the assistance that they need. that they deserve and that they are entitled to. I would also say that as a veteran of World War II. and probably one of about four or five on this floor still here. five or six over in the Senate. there are not very many of us left. but I take no backseat to anybody in supporting veterans. I have a veterans hospital that my predecessor. Sam Rayburn. provided and benefited. And I have had the pleasure of walking in a mass of walkathons to preserve that hospital. from Bonham. Texas. where Mr. Rayburn lived. to Dallas. to protest cuts in it. as anybody here would. Anybody on this floor has to support the purpose of this bill. which is for those that are suffering. The major desire of those that have served in any war is that no other generation would have to fight such a war and that we remove the causes of war. And probably the greatest duty of a Member of Congress is to prevent a war. And how do you prevent a war? You prevdnt a war by removing the causes of it. And energy itself. or the lack of it. has been the cause of most wars that I know anything about. Japan didnt hate this country. Japan loved this country. But our country had cut off their access to oil. They had 13 months national existence. We had to know that Japan would break out somewhere. That was a war over energy. not the hatred of the United States of America. Twelve or fourteen years -ago. George Bush. Senior. sent 450.000 of our troops over to Kuwait. That was not a battle for the emir of Kuwait. We dont care anything at all about the emir of Kuwait. That was to keep a bad guy. Saddam Hussein. from getting his foot on half the known mineral reserves and energy of that area over there. That was a war for energy. So I have a bill that I passed. I passed it as a Democrat once. it failed. it didnt get through. I passed it as a Republican with Democratic and Republican support. It passed this body. The chairman. IKE SKELTON. voted for it at the time. And that bill is now underway. Arid I want to say a few words about that bill because I think youre entitled to know. and Im very hopeful that the other body will look closely at this. And Im going to be working toward that. I havent had the time or the opportunity to work toward it. and neither did I have the incentive to do anything to kill this bill. I urge everybody within the sound of my voice to vote for this bill and to commend IKE SKELTON for his leadership and his devotion to the men and women that fight for this country and care for this country. -. I think unfortunately regarding this bill. he chose to redirect the funds which by law. Public Law 10958. a law that passed the House 275156. a law that Chairmai SKELTON voted for. are reserved for the UltraDeepwater and Unconventional Onshore Natural Gas and Other Petroleum Research and Development Program. also known as section 999. Now the hard. cold facts about it that brought that bill into being was that we can get energy up from the coastal waters. We can get it up to around 80 or 90. 900 feet. And this bill. without the technology. could not get it to the surface where we could benefit from it. But we knew that the energy was there. And we knew that technology was there. And the bill I introduced is not an energy bill nor a technology bill. It puts the two together. And it pays universities. and there are 26 universities in this country. and Im going to mention some of those in a few minutes. that stepped forward. that are working within this bill and have put 3 years work into it. I just think that we need to remember section 999. It has achieved a lot since its enactment. It passed. and it passed the bill. It was in the bill that we passed. what. a year and a half ago. a consortium that administers the program has grown to achieve over 140 entities in 28 States. including 26 universities. Those 26 universities. Im not going to recite all those universities. they are available and people know where they are and which they are. but I do want to point out just some of the universities: MITthis is a list of them hereMIT. Florida International University. Louisiana State University. Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Mississippi State University. It goes on down: Rice University. Texas A&M. Texas Tech. Universities of Kansas. Oklahoma. Texas. Tulsa. Utah. AlaskaFairbanks. Houston. Michigan. South Carolina. Southern California. West Virginia. and West Virginia State. Those are just some of the many institutions that are working within the confines of the bill that we passed. The consortium has awarded dozens of projects. These are underway. If you divert this money from this bill to support the bill that Mr. SKELTON has. these are the things that you~re knocking out. an effort to find energy for 100 years that this country needs. that would prevent us from having to pay foreign agents. Arab nations that we dont trust and dont trust us. those -millions and trillions of dollars could stay here in this country. And the consortium has awarded dozens of projects. including 43 research projects currently underway. with a total project value of nearly $60 million. Also. Madam Speaker. the value of the projects over and above the amount .of annual funding for the projects. $37.500.000 was achieved because iiidustry believes in the value of the program and has invested substantially in it. a testament to the work that the program has achieved to date. These. projects were selected on a competitive basis from over 180 proposals totaling nearly $415 million. This program is underway and the projects awarded by the consortium include components that benefit dozens of universities throughout the country. In fact. the research and developmient projects undertaken through the program have in°cluded the participation of nearly 1.500 energy researchers from coast to coast. These are not the majors. These are little people. These are for little people. These are for the American people. These are to prevent a war in the future by providing the energy of today. Nearly 80 percent of the awards made through the section 999 program have gone to universities. nonprofit organizations. national laboratories. and State institutions. Program awards have created hightech and innovative domestic jobs. The National Energy Technology Laboratory has estimated that the awards would create 1.300 job years from reearch alone. All the while. Madam Speaker. the research projects are aid-: ing the development of cleaner. safer. and more environmentally responsible domestic efergy sources. and yes. hundreds of years of energy that is there. we can bring to the top now that we -couldnt before. We get the technology. It doesnt cost the taxpayers anything. We pay for the energy we get by the technology that gives us the ability to bring it up. ability we didnt havewe couldnt get the energy: With that technology. we can get. that energy. and that is the thing that really breaks my heart to see us kill a program that is underway and is working. It is hundreds of years of energy. I want to just point out one other thing. Section 999 does just the type of research that the Secretary of Energy. the Honorable Steven Chu. feels that the Ftderal Government should be supporting. as he stated in a hearing earlier this year as he testified before the House Science and Technology Committee. So this is a bill that is a wonderful bill. For the purpose of the bill. I support it. Im going to vote for it. I urge everybody else to vote forit. But I urge you to work and look forward and find out for yourself the funds that are being utilized to take its place. already underway successfully and producing for us. not to throw it aside. There are surely other areas that we can find. And I will join Mr. SKELTON in that. as this thing goes to conference. if it goes to conference. or as it works its way through the other body.

1110070681,"Madam Chair. the Democratic bill is silent on the root cause of the financial collapse. It was the government -sponsored enterprises. Fannie and Freddie. that were at the heart of the housing market and largely responsible for the proliferation of subprime and AltA mortgages throughout the financial system. Over the years. they loaded up on over $1 trillion worth of these junk loans. Frankly. Fannie and Freddie also infected capital markets and spread through every sector of our banking system. Before the bursting of the housing bubble. GSE securities constituted more than 150 percent of core capital for insured banks. More than 40 percent of money market mutual fund holdings were in the form of GSE securities. That is why Senator Chuck Hagel offered legislation for stronger regulation which passed the Senate Banking Committee on a partyline vote but was blocked by the Senate Democrats from coming to the floor. My amendment was also defeated. The affordable housing goals were put in by the Democraticcontrolled Congress. They mandated it in 1992. These affordable housing goals led the GSEs into the subprime and AltA market. and ultimately led to their collapse. Former President Bill Clinton understands this epic blunder. He said. ""I think the responsibility that the Democrats have may rest more in resisting any efforts by Republicans in the Congress. or by me when I was President. to put some standards and tighten up a little on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac."" Let it be clear: This is the main reason why our economy is where it is today. and this is why we must reform the GSEs.

1110048952,"Madam President. one final point I wish to make is all of this sort of ties back to what I think is the pattern. the precedent we have seen so far in this Congress. and that is incredible amounts of spending."" incredible amounts of borrowing. The stimulus bill started it off to the tune of about $800 billion. The budget we passed this year on the discretionary. nondefense domestic side was 8.9 percent more year over year than the previous year. The omnibus bill we passedwhich was unfinished business from the last Congresswas 8.3 percent over the previous year. which. again. more than doubled the rate of inflation. We have all these Federal obligations and liabilities that are being created by virtue of these interventions in the marketplace. We have the TARP program. we have all this taxpayer exposure out there. all this spending. and this year we know we are going to have a $1.8 trillion deficit which dwarfs anything we have ever seen in history and as far as the eye cansee. For the next decade. we are looking at about a $1 trillion. on average. annual deficit. Our debt to GDP is headed to historically high levels if predictions are accurate. I think the predictions are optimistic in terms of what we are going to see in economic growth. unemployment. inflation. and interest rates. Even if the projections with respect to the economic indicators are accurate. we are going to see. 10 years from now. the public debt. as a percent of the GDP. reach over 80 percenta rate we have not seen literally since the end of World War II. These are very troubling signs. I think they should be warning flags. warning signs to the people in this country that this level of borrowing. the amount of spending. the amount of taxation. with the new obligations in the health care bill. is too much for our economy to bear and for the American taxpayer to bear.

1110008738,Madam Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I think it would be appropriate for us to review what the SCHIP program is designed and was originally designed to do and where it is in light of what this bill attempts to do. First of all. it stands for the State Childrens Health Insurance Program. States call it by a variety of different names at the State level. In my State. it is called PeachCare. You would imagine that we would do that in Georgia. but it was originally designed in 1997 as a 10year programit was a block grant programdesigned to fill in the need of children who live in families that are above the Medicaid poverty level eligibility but are still below 200 percent of poverty. and that in that capacity was a worthwhile and useful program. During its 10year initial lifespan as it moved forward. there were times when States had shortfalls. In other words. the allocation under the Federal matching rate formula for the SCHIP program. coupled with the States contribution. was not sufficient to meet the demand and the cost of eligible children to be enrolled. and Congress stepped up to the plate. appropriated additional funds. and allowed those States to continue with their legitimate enrollment programs. When it came to the 10year time frame expiring. we were faced with. well. what is the future of SCHIP going to be. After much debate. vetoes by the President. about a program that was going to take a huge step in the area of expanding government control of health care. we did an 18month extension. and that 18 months will expire this next month. And what it did was it said lets take the legitimate needs of the 200 percent of poverty and below. recognizing that some States had already far exceeded that limit. but nevertheless allowing them. to be grandfathered in and provide enough money so that no State runs out of money to cover the eligible children. Unfortunately. the bill before us today continues to take a step. in my opinion. in the wrong direction. We talk about the millions of children that are supposedly going to be enrolled as new enrollees in the program. and yet when we look at those figures. .we find that about 2.5 million of those socalled new enrollees will be children who are already enrolled in private health insurance plans. but because their family is now eligible for the government to pay for their health care. it is anticipated that their families will simply take them off of the private insurance and put them on the taxpayerpaid program of SCHIP. I dont think thats what most Americans in this country want this program to be. Couple that with the fact that we have no provision in this bill that requires States--,111115500,DEAL,NATHAN,H,GA,M,R,9,voting,2009-02-04,73,Mr. DEAL of Georgia,9679,9755,02042009.txt,2692,472,111,2009,madam speaker thank gentleman yield think would appropri us review schip program design origin design light bill attempt first stand state children health insur program state call varieti differ name state level state call peachcar would imagin would georgia origin design year programit block grant fill need children live famili medicaid poverti level elig still percent poverti capac worthwhil use program year initi lifespan move forward time state shortfal word alloc feder match rate formula schip program coupl state contribut suffici meet demand cost elig children enrol congress step plate appropri addit fund allow state continu legitim enrol program came year time frame expir face well futur schip go much debat veto presid program go take huge step area expand govern control health care month extens month expir next month said let take legitim need percent poverti recogn state alreadi far exceed limit nevertheless allow grandfath provid enough money state run money cover elig children unfortun bill us today continu take step opinion wrong direct talk million children supposedli go enrol new enrolle program yet look figur find million socal new enrolle children alreadi enrol privat health insur plan famili elig govern pay health care anticip famili simpli take privat insur put taxpayerpaid program schip dont think that american countri want program coupl fact provis bill requir state,219,FALSE
1110068488,That is what STUPAK and other Members of the House of Representatives saw. that this created tremendous ambiguity and they sought to tighten it up and reinstate the longstanding policy regarding Federal funds and their use to finance abortions since 1977. the Hyde language. The Stupak amendment to the House bill passed with 240 votes. There was a sizable. decisive majority of Members in the House of Representatives who saw through what the ambiguity was that exists regarding the House bill and now the Senate bill. This is intentionally ambiguous for the reasons you mentioned. This simply clarifies. once and for all. what has been standard policy at the Federal level going back to 1977. As the Senator stated earlier. I believe it represents the consensus view in America of both Republicans and Democrats who believe this is ground we can all stand on. irrespective of where people come down on this issue. that the idea that somehow Federal taxpayer funds ought to finance abortions is something most Americans disagree with. That is why there has been such broad. bipartisan support for this particular policy. and that is why it should be extended into the future. As the Senator from Utah said. 61 percent are against funding abortions. But I have seen polls that suggest it is much higher than that. I know it is much higher in my State of South Dakota.

CNN followed me around one day actually at it. saying. you know. its not that often a Member of Congress makes house calls. but this one did. What I did was sit around a kitchen table at a home with some neighbors in this particular neighborhood in my district and listened to stories. And while. obviously. there exists lots of considerable and legitimate fear and angst about what might constitute health care reform. what might be in a bill or not that we heard this summer. we also know there was also an awful lot of orchestrated noise to try to prevent the legitimate debate on health care sometimes and maybe to drown out these stories of average Americans and what they go through at the hands of the health care insurers. So Im picking up on what Ms. PINGREE said. but I am talking about those who have insurance. and yet time after time what I find when I go back to my district is stories. often horror stories. but certainly stories about capricious. arbitrary decision making. We heard a lot of rhetoric this summer about I dont want a lot of government bureaucrats standing between me and my doctor and deciding on my medical care. and I think all three of us would agree with that. We dont want that either. There is a bureaucrat. however. if youre insured in America. standing between you. often. and your medical care. and thats not a government bureaucrat. Its an insurance bureaucrat sitting in a cubicle somewhere. looking for ways to shave costs irrespective of the medical requirements you may have. and sometimes and all too often irrespective of what the recommendation of your doctor may be in terms of best treatment or testing or both. Time and again. we hear sad story after sad story of lack of coverage. capping the amount of coverage. refusal to allow testing or procedures. often for very arbitrary reasons. One of the things I hope. and I know that a number of the versions of health care reform legislation contain. is that we will actually address that. We will rein that in.

1110063008,Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman from Nebraska and the gentleman from Ohio for this legislation. I am a supporter of H.R. 3663. In Kansas and across America. the relationship between pharmacists and patients is a vital part of the way we deliver health care. Patients depend upon pharmacists for information counseling to ensure that they receive quality products and medical services. My mom and dad are 92 and 93 and still live in my hometown of Plainville. Kansas. a town of about 1.900 people. My dad can be stubborn about going to the doctor because the doc may tell him hes not 100 percent healthy. But my dad has morning coffee with Keith Unrein. our local pharmacist. and Keith keeps a watchful eye on my dads health. Access to pharmacies and other health care services determines whether Plainville and other Kansas towns survive and flourish. and we must protect and foster these health facilities. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has required pharmacies that provide diabetes testing supplies and other medical equipment to obtain accreditation by October 1. 2009. in order to dispense these important supplies to Medicare patients. H.R. 3663. as we have heard. will extend this accreditation deadline to January 1 and give Congress the time it needs to better address this issue. Many Kansans live in areas with too few doctors and nurses to meet their primary care needs. At the same time. the average age of Kansans is getting older. Often pharmacists are Kansans most direct link for health information and counseling and the only place for miles that we can obtain muchneeded medical equipment to keep us healthy. However. according to CMSs own estimate. 25.000 medical equipment suppliers will exit the Medicare program due to this new accreditation requirement. We should be encouraging our pharmacies and other medical professionals to provide care to their communities. not burden them with costprohibitive regulatory requirements that do not increase patient safety or expand access for these patients.

I urge passage of this bill to protect Medicare beneficiaries access to their necessary medications and supplies from their trusted pharmacist.,111120570,MORAN,JERRY,H,KS,M,R,1,voting,2009-09-30,146,Mr. MORAN of Kansas,4681,4744,09302009.txt,2212,356,111,2009,mr speaker thank gentleman nebraska gentleman ohio legisl support hr kansa across america relationship pharmacist patient vital part way deliv health care patient depend upon pharmacist inform counsel ensur receiv qualiti product medic servic mom dad still live hometown plainvil kansa town peopl dad stubborn go doctor doc may tell he percent healthi dad morn coffe keith local pharmacist keith keep watch eye dad health access pharmaci health care servic determin whether plainvil kansa town surviv flourish must protect foster health facil center medicar medicaid servic requir pharmaci provid diabet test suppli medic equip obtain accredit octob order dispens import suppli medicar patient hr heard extend accredit deadlin januari give congress time need better address issu mani kansan live area doctor nurs meet primari care need time averag age kansan get older often pharmacist kansan direct link health inform counsel place mile obtain muchneed medic equip keep us healthi howev accord cmss estim medic equip supplier exit medicar program due new accredit requir encourag pharmaci medic profession provid care commun burden costprohibit regulatori requir increas patient safeti expand access patient conclus mr speaker urg passag bill protect medicar beneficiari access necessari medic suppli trust pharmacist,196,FALSE

1110005798,I thank the gentleman. This debate is really about two dollars. This is the dollar thats in the hands of the American people tonight. and this is the dollar. what it looks like when we give it to the Federal Government. You know. it shrinks because we dont spend it wisely. Tonight were being asked to consider a bill for $825 billion. And you know what? We dont have $825 billion. You know what were going to have to do? Were going to have to print these. And guess what? In order to issue them. were going to have to borrow the money from countries like China. The question is. are we going to try and spend and borrow our way out of this economic downturn? The American people know thats not the answer. They also know that its better for them to invest this dollar in the American economy than let the Federal Government go spend this dollar in our economy. Mr. Chair. Im disappointed that we are considering a bill tonight thats almost equal to the entire discretionary budget that would normally go through the appropriation process. Oh. no. we didnt go through any process. we were brought a bill and said this is what we should do.

1110024822,"Mr. President. one of the encouraging things that happened in Washington this year is that the President sent us a budget that was more transparent and more open than previous budgets. It was a 10year budget instead of 5 years. It gave us a blueprint for the future in that way. the way we ought to be thinking about things. It included some things that had not been includedbefore: the cost of the war. the socalled AMT fixto address the millionaires tax the Congress passed in the 1960s designed to catch 155 people who were not paying any taxes. but today will catch 28 million people. mostly middlecliss Americans. unless we fix it. and what around here is irreverently called the ""doc fix."" to deal with the mandated 20percent cut in what Medicare pays its phy-. sicians. That cut in physician payments is not going to happen. we know that. so the President included that in the budget. There was money for helping to fix the banks. to get the toxic assets out of the banks and get credit flowing again. get the economy moving again. and that was in the budget. On big issues like health care. the President .said: Lets work in a bipartisan way. I invite the Congress to come up with a bill. Many Members of Congress said the same thing. The President held a health care summit earlier this month. I agree with the President we should try. to reform health care this year. Most Republicans agree with that. that we need to make it possible for every single family to afford health insurance. People who are losing their jobs today or were between jobs ever understand what difficulty this causes families. So that was encouraging. Now. I hear some very different sounds coming from around the Congress. It makes me wonder who is in charge here. I hear that instead of a 10year budget. we may have a 5year budget. The problem with the 5year budget is most of the problems in the 10year budget are in the second 5 years. This budget spends too much. taxes too much. borrows too much. It doubles the debt in 5 years. the national debt. and it nearly triples the national debt in the 10year period. So we need to know where we are headed with this budget. and we will not know if we just talk about the next 5 years. I hear that we are going to act like the socalled millionaires tax. the AMT. is fixed. That is not fixed. we have to deal with it. The ""doc fix"" to avoid cuts in physician payments? We are just not going to include that in the budget. so I hear. We are going to have to deal with that. We all know we are going to have to deal with that. We ought to put that in the budget. The cost of the war should be there. We need to recognize the first order of business in. this country is to fix the banks and get credit flowing again. Secretary Geithner came forward with a plan on Monday that I hope works. At least for the first time we are beginning to address the central problem of what we do about the toxic assets in the banks that are causing the banks to freeze up and not loan. bringing everything to a halt. Get the toxic assets out and lending increases. houses begin to sell. jobs begin to be created again. people go back to work. the economy improves. So it was a very prudent thing for the President to put in his budget a $250 billion placeholder for the banks. He may need to ask us for that. In my view. I thought he should have asked us for it in January. I thought. instead of passing a $1 trillion stimulus bill. borrowing and spending money we dont have. that it would have been better for President Obama to do now as President Eisenhower did in 1952 when hesaid: I shall go to Korea. And he went to Korea. That was the issue then. It was not the only issue then. just like today there are lots of different things Presidents need to do. But Eisenhower said: I will go to Korea. He arrived there just a few days after Thanksgiving. He said: I will honorably focus my attention on the war until it is ended. The people elected him for that and he did that and he gained the confidence of the American people. I and most Americans .have great donfidence in this President. -If.President Obama. in the sama Way that President Eisenhower said he would go to Korea. says he will fix the banks and he will get credit flowing and he will honorably concentrate his focus on that until the job is doneI think we believe he can do that. So he was right to put the money in the budget. which I understand now may be coming out. So we have a budget that is not really a budget anymore. It is not a clear picture. While I have been very complimentary of the President for his straightforwardness in the budget. that does not mean I have to like what is in the budget because I do not. But before I get to that part of it. let me. talk about the two things that concern me most about what may be coming down the road and which I hope do not come. One of them is the idea that we would use the budget to pass a health care bill to transform the health care system and the American economy. The second is the idea that we would use the budget to impose a national sales tax on electric bills. gasoline prices. and all energyin other words. to impose a capandtrade system on virtually the whole economy. We need to reform health care. We need to debate climate change and cap and trade. But we need to do it in the way the Congress is supposed to do it. not by slipping it through with 51 votes when we are supposed to be making a budget. just because we can do that. Think about that for a moment. The President has created this tremendously good environment for dealing with health care. He ran on a campaign: I am going to change the way things are done in Washington. People need to work across party lines to get things done on big issues that affect the country. That is what the President said. He is right about that. There are a lot of new Senators who were elected saying the same thing. There are a lot of Senators who have been here before. like me. who said exactly thisI am here to try to work across party lines to get results on big issues. There is not a bigger issue than health care. after we get through fixing the banks. The President had. as I mentioned. the health care summit at the White Houseoff to a much better start. this President. than President Clinton was when he tried to deal with the same issue early in his administration. The President also had a fiscal responsibility summit in February that I attended where health care was a major topic. We were all there. and various people got up and said: We need to work on this. do this together. The President wisely said: I am not going to send a proposal. I am going to let the Congress develop a proposal. We will work with you on these things. Well. all of a sudden. we hear that the health care plan might becoming through on the budget. How can we possibly do that? If the President and Senate Democrats try to use this arcane budget procedure to reform health care. it will be the Parliamentarian and his wonderful staff who will end up writing the health care bill. Health care is 17 percent of the American gross domestic product. These are big issues. Are we going to have a singlepayer system? Is everybody going to have Medicare? Is anybody going to have a choice of a doctor? Is anyone going to have a choice of an insurance policy? What about the guaranteed costs? Will all Americans have the same kind of health coverage that Federal employees. including Senators. have? Is that a good idea? Will we give more permission to large employers to connect behavior to health care premiums so that we can have more prevention of disease? How much do we spend on people who are older and where we are spending more time? Mr. President. I do not believe there is another Republican speaker.

1110016497,Madam Speaker. since its inception in 1996. the American Battlefield Protection Program has provided grants for preserving endangered battlefields of the Civil War. which are specifically not part of the National Park system. The program contains two components. The Battlefield Preservation Grants Program is designed to help State and local governments. private organizations and citizens protect battlefield sites. The Battlefield Acquisition Grant Program provides matching funds to help State and local governments acquire and preserve battlefield sites. Together. these two programs have helped protect more than 15.000 acres at 72 Civil War battlefields. They have leveraged more than $50 million in nonFederal funding for battlefield protection. Madam Speaker. as we all know. several timesensitive pieces of legislation were caught up in the lengthy debate about public lands issues in the other body. Because of that delay. the original law for this program lapsed last September. H.R. 548 would restore this important program and authorize it through 2019. As I said in connection with the previous bill on battlefields of the War of 1812 and the Revolution. preserving these historic sites is important not for looking back. but for looking forward. for knowing where we came from and where we are going. for knowing that we are a Nation conceived in liberty and dedicated on the proposition that all are equal. The lesson of the Civil War battlefields is a lesson for todays children. for tomorrows children. for all citizens. I commend our colleague. Representative GARY MILLER of California. for his leadership on this issue and his commitment to historic preservation. I urge my colleagues to support passage of H.R. 548. Madam Speaker.

There really is a great philosophical divide on a part of this issue. but its really just a part of this issue. There are subsets on which theres agreement. When we talk about where the divide is. I think the gentleman from Utah said it well. that the divide is between the notion which the President is advancing that the only way to fix the problems we have in health care today. and Republicans agree there are deep problems in the delivery of health care services today. but the Democrats and the President say the way to fix that is massive government intervention in and. quite frankly. taking control of the entire health care system and the entire health insurance industry.,111116030,SHADEGG,JOHN,H,AZ,M,R,3,voting,2009-09-16,589,Mr. SHADEGG,26123,26176,09162009.txt,1940,355,111,2009,thank gentleman yield watch gentlemen engag hour earlier felt ought come tri add perhap bring differ perspect articul concern new way want thank colleagu missouri effort want thank colleagu utah compliment hard work issu confront realli want hit two part importantli want hit final point gentleman utah hit process pass legisl signific nation think gentleman utah right need open process need opportun everyon surfac idea need dialogu quit frankli happen happen gentleman led discuss point list differ bill paul ryan wisconsin bill tom price georgia bill bill mani mani republican bill shockingli media doesnt tell american peopl republican idea yet think gentleman utah said well realli great philosoph divid part issu realli part issu subset there agreement talk divid think gentleman utah said well divid notion presid advanc way fix problem health care today republican agre deep problem deliveri health care servic today democrat presid say way fix massiv govern intervent quit frankli take control entir health care system entir health insur industri,163,FALSE

1110034535,for introducing this resolution. As a former Escanaba City police officer. a Michigan State police trooper and as an attorney. I saw every day the effect of crime on our citizens. Crime leaves its victims feeling unsafe in their own communities and vulnerable to the often complicated judicial system. As the cochairman of the Law Enforcement Caucus. I know that when a crime is committed. our law enforcement agencies work hard so the criminal is brought to justice. But there is another part to the equation. The victim of crime must be provided with assistance and support to recover from this often traumatic experience. Our law enforcement agencies work with the court system to ensure that victims of crime are treated fairly and with respect to ones dignity and privacy. We must step up to the plate and show our strong commitment to the criminal justice system by ensuring that victims of crimes feel safe in their own communities. The creation of the National Crime Victims Crime Week is a good first step to increase public awareness of the rights and needs of victims of crime. Congress should go even further by ensuring the legal protections are in place to protect victims of crime. During the National Law Enforcement Week in May. I will introduce an amendment to the United States Constitution to protect the rights of all victims. I hope you will join me in ensuring our Constitution explicitly supports the rights of victims of crime.

So we have spent about 90 percent of our time coming up with that alternative.

1110075317,"I reclaim my right to the floor because he doesnt want to deal in good faith with this issue. My second point. It is disrespectful. it is unseemly for Senators in this body to invoke the names of Ted Kennedy and Jack Kennedy in opposition to this bill. It is disrespectful and unseemly. I. frankly. am very much surprised that Senators would go to that level and invoke the names of Ted Kennedy and Jack Kennedy in opposition to this legislation. Talk about profiles in courage. I hear Senators on the other side say: Where is the courage of one Senator to stand up and vote against health care reform? That is what I keep hearing. Where is the courage? Where is the courage of one Senator on the Democratic side to stand up and vote against health care reform? Mr. President. I want to turn that around. ""Profiles in Courage""-Jack Kennedy and Ted Kennedy were Senators who worked to try to find resolutions to agreements. They wanted to compromise. They wanted to work together to get just results. I ask. where is the Senator on that side of the aisle who has the courage to break from their leadership. break from the partisanship they are exercising on their side of the aisle to work together to pass health care reform? I ask. where is the courage? Where are the Senators who have the courage on that side of the aisle to stand up and work together on a bipartisan basis to get health care reform passed? Where? We on this side reached out our hands for bipartisan agreement on health care reform. probably to a fault. I say ""to a fault"" because for months and months this Senator. anyway. extended the hand to work with other Senators on a bipartisan basis. I know the current occupant of the chair knows that. He watched this. He saw it happen in the Finance Committee. Senator GRASSLEY and I worked very hard to get Senators on both sides of the aisle to work to pass health care reform. very hard. Then after a while we had to work toward another approach. The Group of 63 Republicans. 3 Democratsworked for months on a bipartisan basis to get health care reform passed. Do you know what happened? I watched it happen. Those Senators in the room were acting in good faith. They were in good faith. They wanted to mutually work together to pass health care reform. They asked good questions. Senator ENZI from Wyoming. for example. asked very good questions. Senator SNOWE asked very good questions. Senator GRASSLEY asked very good questions. We worked to get health care reform. But do you know what happened? I could feel it happening. One by one by one. they started to drift away. They wanted to pass health care reform. They wanted to act in a bipartisan basis. But they were pressuredpressured from their political party not to do it. not to do it. not to do it. Why were they pressured not to do it? Unfortunately. they gave in to the pressure because their leadership wanted to make a political statement. One of the Senators on the floor here said: Lets make health care Obamas Waterloo. They did not want to work with us. that side of the aisle. They did not want to work with us because they thought it was better to make a political statement: Attack the bill. attack the bill. attack the bill. attack the bill in order to make political points for the 2010 election. That is what they were trying to do. I ask. where is the courage? Where is the courage? Where is the Republican Senator who will stand up and say: Boy. lets work together to pass health care reform. Where is the Senator who will stand up and say: We want to work together to pass health care reform. This Senator tried mightily to get bipartisan support. Ask Senator GRASSLEY from Iowa. with whom I have been working for a long. long time. They were pulled away.

1110072797,Reclaiming my time. the answer is selfevident by the question. Of course. we would benefit from stricter standards for fish. vegetables. and fruits. That was the point I was making. But what we have done with respect to importation of prescription drugs is we have included batch lots and pedigrees and tracers that do not exist in the existing drug supply. Why? The existing drug supply does not have those provisions because they have been objected to over the years by the pharmaceutical industry. We have put in place procedures that will make this safe. You cannot say the same thing about fruits. vegetables. and seafood. unfortunately. A lot of work needs to be done there. But we do not bring a bill to the floor of the Senate. a bipartisan group of legislators. a bill that would in any way injure or provide problems with respect to safety. What we do is bring to the floor of the Senate legislation that dramatically enhances the margin of safety for prescription drugs. But I understand. I understand completely. If I were trying to protect. and I were the drug industry trying to protect billions. boy. I understand the exertion of effort to try to protect that. My only point is this: I have a beef with an industry that decides they are going to overcharge the American people. in some cases 10 times more. in some cases 5. double the price that is paid in other parts of the world for the identical drug. I dont think that is fair. and I dont think we should allow it to continue. The way to prevent it is to give the American people the freedomevery European has that freedom.

1110008729,Madam Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 2 as amended and this rule. We will finally pass the childrens health care bill today. send it to President Obama for his signature. and provide affordable medical care to millions of children across America. I was in the pediatricians office last Friday with my daughters. There is nothing like the feeling of knowing that your children are healthy after a checkup or that they are on the road to recovery. I speak for millions of parents who can share that sense of relief because they can take their kids to the doctors office and do so without breaking the family bank. What good news for all Americans that one of the first bills President Obama will sign today will be one that improves access to quality affordable health care and reduces the cost of health care for families. More affordable health care is central to our economic recovery and it is fundamental for families. I am proud to say -that the precursor to SCHIP originated in the 1990s as a novel health care initiative in my home State of Florida.where the innovators enrolled kids in a health care plan at the start of the school year. They understood that healthy kids succeed in school at higher rates. President Clinton and the Congress were so impressed by what Florida was doing in Florida Kidcare. they took the blueprint and fashioned the national SCHIP partnership. Access to health care for working families in my community and all over America through this innovative partnership between Federal. State and local communities is a winning proposition. The new law will make it easier for parents and kids to afford the doctors office visits. and encourage States to cut costly bureaucratic red tape. Our childrens health care initiative ensures that newborn babies receive the medical checkups and immunizations they need. ensures that toddlers and children are taken care of as they grow. and ensures that we all save money through preventative care. Suffering through President Bushs opposition over the past years has been very costly. and we have lost ground. In Florida alone. over 800.000 children lack health insurance and thats the third highest rate in the U.S. Its more than the population of some States and it is growing. The lack of affordable health care for these working families is making it more expensive for everyone. We are on a different path now. I thank the many members who championed SCHIP as an initiative that works within a broader health care system that leaves many unable to afford health care in America. especially Speaker PELOSI. who never gave up and kept the promise that in the first days of a new Congress with a new President. the health of Americas kids and the pocketbooks of hardworking families would be paramount.,111118880,CASTOR,KATHY,H,FL,F,D,11,voting,2009-02-04,64,Ms. CASTOR of Florida,2246,2314,02042009.txt,2779,474,111,2009,madam speaker rise support hr amend rule final pass children health care bill today send presid obama signatur provid afford medic care million children across america pediatrician offic last friday daughter noth like feel know children healthi checkup road recoveri speak million parent share sens relief take kid doctor offic without break famili bank good news american one first bill presid obama sign today one improv access qualiti afford health care reduc cost health care famili afford health care central econom recoveri fundament famili proud say precursor schip origin novel health care initi home state innov enrol kid health care plan start school year understood healthi kid succeed school higher rate presid clinton congress impress florida florida kidcar took blueprint fashion nation schip partnership access health care work famili commun america innov partnership feder state local commun win proposit new law make easier parent kid afford doctor offic visit encourag state cut costli bureaucrat red tape children health care initi ensur newborn babi receiv medic checkup immun need ensur toddler children taken care grow ensur save money prevent care suffer presid bush opposit past year costli lost ground florida alon children lack health insur that third highest rate us popul state grow lack afford health care work famili make expens everyon differ path thank mani member champion schip initi work within broader health care system leav mani unabl afford health care america especi speaker pelosi never gave kept promis first day new congress new presid health america kid pocketbook hardwork famili would paramount,254,FALSE

I would like to rebut his remarks regarding Mr. Bill Lynn. In regards to the Executive order on ethics. I agree President Obama is attempting to set high standards for executive branch appointees. however. giving special waivers to nominees such as Mr. Lynn water down the spirit and authority of his own Executive order. I would ask President Obama: How many more waivers will you grant in the next 4 years? I say to Chairman LEVIN. you seemed to blame former Defense Secretary Cohen for the financial troubles at DOD. not Mr. Lynn. I could not disagree with you more on this issue. Chief Financial Officer Lynn was chiefly responsible for the policies and regulations governing accounting practices. His straightpay policy went against all commonsense accounting practices.

1110072455,"Madam Speaker. I rise to speak about H.R. 1110. the PHONE Act. which stands for Preventing Harassment through Outbound Number Enforcement. It will be voted on tomorrow. This bill addresses the growing and serious problems of caller ID fraud that allows the caller to hide their true identity to obtain personal information for use in identity theft and scams. Answering your phone is like answering your door. youre letting someone into your home and you need to know that whoever that person says they are is true. Caller ID was originally designed to give you that information so you could decide to answer your phone and have the confidence that you were not taking a call that is unwanted. unsafe. or unknown. That is why I worked across the aisle with Representative BOBBY SCOTT in introducing H.R. 1110. which was first introduced in the 109th Congress. Representative SCOTT took the lead in the 110th Congress. and now we are again working together in the 111th Congress to pass this very important bill. I thank Representative SCOTT for his leadership and teamwork in passing this public safety bill. The legislation is aimed at preventing and prohibiting caller ID spoofing. Spoofing is made available with Internet services that will provide false numbers and even disguise your voice so you can easily fool the person on the other end of the phone. Criminals coax victims into giving up sensitive personal information by making it appear that a call is coming from a legitimate institution. such as a bank. doctors office. government office. or even a family member. Misleading caller ID information also allows the spoofer to cause a victim to accept a call they would otherwise avoid. leading to harassment. Even more serious potential dangers exist. A pedophile could stalk a child by stealing a school phone number or the phone number of a friend or child. A sexual predator could use a doctors office phone number to call their victim. The problems with caller ID spoofing are very real. Let me give you a few examples. There are cases where criminals using stolen credit card numbers call a service such as Western Union. They program the caller ID to appear to originate from the cardholders home and use the credit card number to order cash transfers. Seniors have been misled into believing they missed jury duty. It appeared the local courthouse was calling and victims were asked for Social Security numbers to prevent prosecution. The calls seemed legitimate because the telephone number of the local courthouse showed up on caller ID. In another example. a SWAT team surrounded a building after it appeared a call came from within stating that a woman was being held hostage when. in fact. the call was coming from another location. The SWAT team showed up expecting to face an armed perpetrator. Luckily. no one was hurt in this one instance. but one can easily imagine what could have happened if an unsuspecting bystander happened to be at that location. a series of misunderstandings could have ended up in tragedy. Unfortunately. this process called ""swatting"" has occurred dozens of times. And just this month. there have been two serious cases of caller ID fraud in the news. In Columbia. Maryland. a teenager was arrested for making terrorist phone calls to his former school. calling in a bomb scare and telling school officials there was a student on campus with a gun. The teen used spoofing to make the phone number appear to be coming from Texas. Fortunately. the police were able to subpoena the phone records and arrest the teen. In Brooklyn. New York. a woman used caller ID fraud to exact revenge on her husband and his pregnant girlfriends newborn baby. She illegally obtained a prescription that would induce labor early and called the girlfriend. using spoofing. to make it appear that her obstetrician was calling. The woman. thinking she was under doctors orders. took the medication and the baby was delivered 2 months premature. Police were able to track down the woman when she tried to deliver a poisonous mixture to the hospital disguised as milk. allegedly intending to kill the baby. The police arrested the woman. avoiding a devastating. tragic. and potentially fatal outcome that originated by using caller ID fraud. This could have been avoided if the caller had not used a fraudulent caller ID or if the police could have tracked down the perpetrator sooner. This bill will make the act of caller ID fraud a felony. and criminals could see fines of up to $250.000 and jail time up to 5 years if convicted of using caller ID fraud in perpetrating another crime. I urge all my colleagues to pass this PHONE Act.

1110065471,"Mr. Speaker. todays vote will be the most important of our careers. History will mark which side were on: providing quality. affordable coverage for all Americans. or the status quo. I would remind my friend from Wisconsin that former Senator Bob Dole voted against Medicare. and that vote has haunted him ever since. It probably prevented him from becoming President. Since my first election. I have worked to see that government serves our people. My top priority for 37 years has been to provide quality. affordable health care for all. I wish we had done it sooner. but at my age. you learn to take what you can when you can get it. The bill is not the bill that many of us would have created on our own. That is the legislative process. The compromise before us today is the right thing to do for the American people. The bill guarantees health coverage to 96 percent of Americans. Its fully paid for. People who like their coverage indeed can keep it. It reforms health insurance regulation and requires shared responsibility by individuals. businesses. and government. It assures that health care is affordable for lower- and middleincome families. It fills the Medicare prescription drug doughnut hole. and it provides free preventive services in Medicare.

1110039141,"Mr. President. even though President Obama has said we should look forward. some in Congress insist on looking backward to a broader investigation of interrogation tactics that were used against 9/11 terrorists to find out whether even more airplanes were on their. way to kill even more Americans.These interrogation tactics are now well known. They had been approved by the National Security Council. approved by the Department of Justice. were known to senior Democratic and Republican Members of Congress who. CIA records now show. were briefed some 40 times. The CIA has not used the tactics in question for several years. They are not being used today. The Congress has since enacted laws that make clear that interrogation tactics used by the military are limited to those contained in the Army Field Manual. The President extended those same limitations. to intelligence agencies this year by Executive order. The President is following his own advice about looking forward by asking the National Security Council to review what tactics would be appropriate when terrorists are captured who might have information about imminent attacks on Americans. The Senate Intelligence Committee is conducting its own review of tactics and is considering expanding the briefing process for interrogation tactics. Despite these investigations. some still say. lets have ""a fullblown criminal"" investigation. That raises these questions: Investigation of whom? Where do we draw the line? Where is the logical place to stop? On Thursday. I asked these questions of the Attorney General. Eric Holder. at a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing. He found it difficult to give me specific answers. To begin with. the Attorney General did not answer my question about what directions he had received from the White House concerning interrogations. Then. he would only answer ""hypothetically"" when I asked if we are going to investigate lawyers for giving their opinions. shouldnt we also investigate intelligence agents who created the interrogation techniques and asked for the opinions. or officials who approved the techniques. or Members of Congress who knew about or approved or even encouraged. the interrogation tactics? The Attorney General could not remember whether he knew or approved of renditions that occurred during the Clinton administration when he was Deputy Attorney Generalrenditions that took captured terrorists to other countries. for example. perhaps to Egypt for custody. maybe for interrogation. He did not say what precautions he took to make sure these renditions followed the law. The Attorney Generals unresponsive answers and poor memory suggest what a difficult path it will be if the Government continues to publicize and expand its investigation of interrogation tactics. This is not a pleasant subject. When we debated it in the Senate in 2005. I wasamong those Senators. including Senator McCAIN.. who disagreed with the administration.. We believed it was Congresss constitutional responsibility to set the rules for dealing with detainees and we helped enact a law requiring that techniques used by the military should be limited to those in the Army Field Manual. But showing videotapes of even those techniques will not be a pretty sight. Public officials. of course. should follow the law. But it is not necessary to have a circus to determine whether the law was followed. If there is to be a broader investigation than currently is underway. it must be fair and evenhanded and lead wherever it may leadperhaps to intelligence officers. perhaps to administration officials. perhaps to Members of Congress. The Attorney General himself needs to be willing to say what he knew and when he knew it and what he did about renditions during the Clinton administration when he was Deputy Attorney General. Obsessively looking in the rear view mirror could consume our Nations every waking moment. There is plenty about Americas history that. in retrospect. we wish had not happened: Supreme Court decisions barring Blacks from public facilities. Congress filibustering antilynching laws. excluding Jews from major institutions. denying women the right to vote. incarcerating Japanese Americans during World War TI. We have dealt with those instances best by acknowledging and correcting them. not wallowing in them by recognizing that the United States has always been a work in progress toward great* goals. rarely achieving them. often falling back. but always trying. In fact. the late political scientist Samuel Huntington has written that most of our political debates are about dealing with the disappointment of not meeting great goals we have set for ourselves. Then there is the thoroughly practical question of who will want to serve in public life in Washington. DC. if the first thing a newly elected administration does is to try to discredit. disbar. or indict all those with whom it disagrees in the last administration. Some of that damage already has been done. For all these reasons. I would hope the President will follow his first instinct and insist that we go forward as a countryfocus on the economy. on the banks and the auto companies. on health care and energy. on a Supreme Court Justice. and two wars in which our men and women are serving.

Relyea will retire as a specialist in American National Government at the Congressional Research Service. CRS. His service and devotion to the U.S. Congress will be greatly missed. President Thomas Jefferson once observed that ""information is the currency of democracy."" He also noted that ""whenever the people are wellinformed. they can be trusted with their own government."" Thanks to the fine work of Dr. Relyea and his colleagues at the Congressional Research Service. the peoples representatives in Congress are wellinformedand. thus. wellarmedto preserve and defend the ideals. structure. and balance of our government as envisioned by our Founding Fathers. As Senators and staff come and go. the best ORS specialists become repositories of institutional knowledge. deep wells of experience who offer perspective and thoughtful analysis. Such specialists tend to take a long view on issues. having seen issues and trends emerge and reemerge in varying forms. These public servants enlighten and educate Members. and sometimes testify before congressional committees. These men 9nd women are steeped in their field of expertise. and though some come to be recognized for their published work and analysis. most labor in anonymity. satisfied by the pure reward of helping to inform and shape the public debate. Dr. Relyea is. and has been. reliable. authoritative. and humblea genuine example of the true public servant over the long years of his career. A native of Oneida. NY. Dr. Relyea earned his doctorate in government in 1971 from American Universitymy own alma mater. He joined the Congressional Research Service that same year. shortly after the enactment of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 that provided the charter for the modern Congressional Research Service. Dr. Relyea was promoted to head of the Executive Organization and Administration Section at CRS in 1976. Twenty years later. he became the head of the executive and judiciary section of the government and finance division. As a Specialist in American National Government. Dr. Relyea garnered national recognition for his research and writings on the Presidency. and executive branch powers and organization. I came to know Dr. Relyea in 2002. as the Bush administration attempted to expand its use of emergency and wartime powers. and I increasingly sought to defend and assert the rights and privileges of the Congress as a coequal branch of government under the U.S. Constitution. I recall sitting across the table from Dr. Relyea in the Appropriations Committee hearing room. where I had asked several CRS specialists to brief me on the creation of a new Department of Homeland Security. I remember being impressed by Dr. Relyeas depth of knowledge. and his timely and thorough responses to my requests for information. Dr. Relyea and others sacrificed their August recess that year. in order to help prepare for a long debate when the Senate returned in September. I welcome this opportunity to thank Dr. Relyea. and to thank everyone at the Congressional Research Service for their hard work and dedication. As a source of necessary expertise for Members of Congress. CRS helps to provide a vital counterweight to a mighty and powerful Executive branch. In a career that has spanned four decades and eight administrations. Dr. Harold C. Relyea has set a standard of superior service for the entire Congressional Research Service. Its clear that Dr. Relyea has earned the respect and appreciation of his colleagues. He is a patient and generous mentor and has assisted a full generation of CRS analysts in developing their skills. In 2008. his colleagues Showered praise on Dr. Relyea as they nominated him for the prestigious Directors Award. I think their greatest tribute to him. however. would be to continue his outstanding legacy of scholarship. I thank Dr. Relyea for his extraordinary dedication to the work and traditions of the U.S. Congress and to the country and the Constitution which we all revere.",111114621,BYRD,ROBERT,S,WV,M,D,,voting,2009-01-26,117,Mr. BYRD,6335,6462,01262009.txt,4118,658,111,2009,mr presid januari year servic librari congress dr harold retir specialist american nation govern congression research servic cr servic devot us congress greatli miss presid thoma jefferson observ inform currenc democraci also note whenev peopl wellinform trust govern thank fine work dr colleagu congression research servic peopl repres congress thu preserv defend ideal structur balanc govern envis found father senat staff come go best or specialist becom repositori institut knowledg deep well experi offer perspect thought analysi specialist tend take long view issu seen issu trend emerg reemerg vari form public servant enlighten educ member sometim testifi congression committe men nd women steep field expertis though come recogn publish work analysi labor anonym satisfi pure reward help inform shape public debat dr reliabl authorit genuin exampl true public servant long year career nativ oneida ny dr earn doctor govern american alma mater join congression research servic year shortli enact legisl reorgan act provid charter modern congression research servic dr promot head execut organ administr section cr twenti year later becam head execut judiciari section govern financ divis specialist american nation govern dr garner nation recognit research write presid execut branch power organ came know dr bush administr attempt expand use emerg wartim power increasingli sought defend assert right privileg congress coequal branch govern us constitut recal sit across tabl dr appropri committe hear room ask sever cr specialist brief creation new depart homeland secur rememb impress dr depth knowledg time thorough respons request inform dr other sacrif august recess year order help prepar long debat senat return septemb welcom opportun thank dr thank everyon congression research servic hard work dedic sourc necessari expertis member congress cr help provid vital counterweight mighti power execut branch career span four decad eight administr dr harold set standard superior servic entir congression research servic clear dr earn respect appreci colleagu patient gener mentor assist full gener cr analyst develop skill colleagu shower prais dr nomin prestigi director award think greatest tribut howev would continu outstand legaci scholarship thank dr extraordinari dedic work tradit us congress countri constitut rever,365,FALSE
1110005377,Mr. President. I would be happy to disclose to my colleague that I voted against the bill. for the same reasons that without changes I will oppose it this year because the eligibility requirement is being expanded. As I said. and I thought fairly clearly. when you expand eligibility. you take the pressure off of making sure the enrollees come from the most at risk. It is my hope we can modify this bill. I am not embarrassed to be on the Senate floor and talk about the aspects of this legislation that I am unhappy with. But certainly.I can count. and I know the majority can move this bill at any point they feel comfortable. and I am sure they will.

1110044460,"Mr. President. I know we are on the 30 hours postcloture on the legislation that is the Family. Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. I support that legislation. I applaud our colleague Senator KENNEDY for his leadership on this issue. It gives the. FDA the authority to regulate tobacco. including. ingredients in tobacco products and tobacco marketing. which I think is an important step for our Nations health. We talked a lot about this in the past. The fact is that smoking and the use of tobacco is dangerous to ones health. We know that. I had a doctor once say there are three things that will give you pretty good odds for a longer life. One is wear a seatbelt. The second is keep your weight down. And the third is dont smoke. Pretty sound advice. The ""dont smoke"" piece is about -the health consequences of smoking. We know especially the issue of marketing and marketing to children is a pernicious activity. We also know the best way you can get somebody hooked on cigarettes is to get them when they are kids. get them when they are young. Do you know of anybody who at age 35 is sitting in a LaZBoy recliner watching a color television set ruminating about life and thinking to themselves: What on Earth have I missed in life? What can I do to enhance my life? What should I be doing that I so far have been unable to do and they decide: I have to take up smoking. That just doesnt happen. If you dont get them when they are kids. - you dont get them. That is .why we pay a lot of attention to addiction to nicotine. marketing to children. and so on. Let me say again the leadership of Senator KENNEDY and so many others on a bipartisan basis on this issue I think is very important. It deals directly with the issue of the health of the American people. - I do want to say. however. that I intend to offer an amendment tomorrow when we get on the bill itself. I want to describe why I am offering an amendment and what the amendment does. The amendment is called the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act. This underlying bill deals with the FDA. So. too. will my amendment deal with the FDA. I will offer the amendment with Senator SNOWE from Maine. the DorganSnowe bill which we worked on for a long while.

1110024559,"Mr. Speaker. it is pronounced ""Buyer."" My family is Alsatian. so if you go back in my ancestry. I know the gentleman is new here to the Congress. it was de Buyer. So my sense is that the gentleman will remember it for a while. I come to the floor here to talk about a very pivotal issue that will be facing the public health of our country. and this is the issue of tobacco. Members of the House will be presented with a choice here relatively . soon about which Federal regulatory structure over tobacco products we should use. Now. it is interesting. for a long time the issue was whether we should regulate tobacco or not regulate tobacco. There is now this growing concensus that the Federal Government in some way should regulate tobacco. and now we are trying to figure out with regard to who should do that regulation. Should it be the FDA under Health and Human Services. or. as Mr. MCINTYRE and I are proposing. that it be a separate agency under Health and Human Services. we call it a harm reduction agency. that will focus on reduction of the risk associated with many different types of tobacco products. So I believe that the critical issue to be considered is. how do we measurably and effectively reduce the disease and death associated with tobacco use while products remain legal and over 45 million Americans have not. cannot. or will not quit? Keeping the American tobacco consumer and the public uninformed about the differences in risk between -smoking cigarettes and using nonburning forms of tobacco or other nicotine products will not help our Nation to overcome the death and disease attributed to tobacco use. Telling current tobacco smokers to ""Just Say No."" to quit now. is not the most effective way to save lives. Creating a regulatory scheme that discourages and in fact chills the development of new. lower risk products is directly opposite of what many in the scientific and public health communities even advocate today. But those are the underlying tenets of what is referred to as the Waxman tobacco legislation called the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. What do experts say about Mr. WAXMANs approach on tobacco? Well. the prestigious health organization. the Royal College of Physicians. says. ""The current situation is perverse. unjust. and acts against the rights and best interests of smokers and the public health. Harm reduction has the potential to play a major part in preventing death and disability in millions of people who currently smoke and who either cannot or will not otherwise quit smoking. These smokers have a right to be able to obtain and choose from a range of safer nicotine products. and they have a right to accurate and unbiased information to guide that choice."" From the American Association of Public Health Physicians. ""In the judgment of AAPHA. the current bill in its form will do more harm than good in terms of future tobaccorelated illness and death. The current bill."" referring to the Waxman bill. ""with all its seemingly promising elements. has so many restrictions on Federal tegulatory authority that it will be unable to effect favorable change. This bill is based on the false premise that cigarettes can be made safer and that all tobacco products are equally harmful. This bill places barriers to truthful communications about the relative risk of less hazardous smokeless tobacco products and near insurmountable barriers to the development of new lower risk products."" Now. these are two examples of organizations that have some growing concerns about the Waxman legislation. Now. in the face of that there is a growing consensus that significant harm reduction policies and programs. when combined with prevention and cessation. are. in my belief and that of MIKE MCINTYRE. the chief cosponsor of North Carolina. that it is the key to a significant reduction in disease and death from tobacco use. So the Waxman legislation. despite the years of characterizations and representations by its proponents. does not incorporate in any meaningful way a comprehensive prevention. cessation. and harm reduction strategy. Actually. on the contrary. for a very long time. those of whom believe that a harm reduction strategy in fact threatens cessation and prevention programs. I look at this and say that they should all work together. that four fingers and a thumb makes a hand. And so. without the phalanges. do you really have a hand? So I believe that they all should have to work together. and that is what we are seeking to do here is having a harm reduction strategy that incorporates prevention. education. and cessation. I am also greatly concerned that the Waxman legislation continues to ignore the evolution of opinion in the scientific and public health communities. and relies on tactics taught and thought that were effective in the early 1990s. such as it includes provisions that the Supreme Court had thrown out with regard to restrictions on First Amendment on advertising these issues. I was really concerned about it. and Mr. WAXMAN believes it is okay. -I have great. great concern here.  Congressman MIKE MCINTYRE and I have introduced H.R. 1216. the Youth Prevention and Tobacco Harm Reduction Act. This legislation imposes significant regulatory oversight within the Department of Health and Human Services over tobacco products. and incorporates many of the provisions included in HENRY WAXMANS legislation. It includes serious policy and programs of prevention. cessation. and harm reduction. which we believe will lead to saving thousands of lives over .the next decades. It will squarely address the issue of tobacco use by minors through additional resources and enforcement at the State levels. In fact. Mr. McINTYREs and my legislation is even stronger in the protections for minors on two points. Number one. we say unto the States that vjith regard to the Master Settlement Agreement and monies that were supposed to be spent by the States on tobacco cessation and education and prevention programs. at the end of the Master Settlement before it was signed there was this lastmoment agreement. Rather than dictating unto States on what percentage of the monies are to be spent on tobacco prevention and cessation programs they said. well. we will just leave it to the discretion of the States. The CDC then every year publishes a report with regard to what the percentage that States should be spending. States are not spending on those programs. So Mr. MCINTYRE and I come in. and we are dictating unto the States that they are to spend thei r Master Settlement Tobacco Agreement on programs to help children. The other point that Mr. MCINTYRE of North Carolina and I have is on protecting children. We are also saying to the States that we want you to treat tobacco like alcohol. So where it is illegal for a minor to possess alcohol. we also say: States. you should make it illegal for minors to possess tobacco. With that. let me yield to a major cosponsor of this legislation. This is bipartisan legislation. It is an alternative to Mr. WAXMAN. And. actually. what Mr. MCINTYRE and I were really hopeful is that our bill here would have been adopted in the Energy and Commerce Committee as a substitute. If we could have combined our effort with that of Mr. WAXMANS. we would have 435. votes here on the floor. and we could make this a reality and make our society a healthier and safer place. I want to thank the gentleman for his efforts.

1110049109,Madam Speaker. I. for one. am looking forward to a number of celebrations. One of those celebrations that I hope to very much participate in in the near future will involve the gentlelady who happens to be the Speaker at this moment. . But having talked about celebrations. I think it would be most interesting when we reach the point where the leadership on the other side of the aisle. including my own committee. would stop presuming that every problem in the world can easily be set aside because you can blame the past President about this. As I remember. I think we had a vote in the House in which there was broadly based bipartisan support. for .example. for the incursion of Iraq in support of the thenPresident. .I must say we have had a lot of conversation about items that are not directly in this bill today having to do with Guantanamo. If Im not mistaken. that issue would not be before us if the current President had not decided that he was going. and publicly committed. to his closing of Guantanamo. Thats creating this horrendous problem. Setting all that aside as I close. Madam Speaker. the bill before us or the item before us is an item that involves the conference thats about to take place between the Senate and the House having to do with the supplemental funding that was designed originally to give support for our efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq and. indeed. a very bipartisan support here in the House. My consternation is that it appears as though weve set aside that bipartisan support for the convenience of the leadership and. indeed. will have a conference with the Senate that involves two things: a significant reduction of about $5 billion in the money available to support our troops. and. above and beyond that. for all intents and purposes. about that sum of money is transferred for foreign aid. for funding for IMF. for providing access to all kinds of countries who are not friendly to the United States by way of funding that would be supported by our taxpayers.,111116930,LEWIS,JERRY,H,CA,M,R,41,voting,2009-06-11,286,Mr. LEWIS of California,24980,25036,06112009.txt,2009,355,111,2009,madam speaker one look forward number celebr one celebr hope much particip near futur involv gentleladi happen speaker moment talk celebr think would interest reach point leadership side aisl includ committe would stop presum everi problem world easili set asid blame past presid rememb think vote hous broadli base bipartisan support exampl incurs iraq support thenpresid must say lot convers item directli bill today guantanamo im mistaken issu would us current presid decid go publicli commit close guantanamo that creat horrend problem set asid close madam speaker bill us item us item involv confer that take place senat hous supplement fund design origin give support effort afghanistan iraq inde bipartisan support hous constern appear though weve set asid bipartisan support conveni leadership inde confer senat involv two thing signific reduct billion money avail support troop beyond intent purpos sum money transfer foreign aid fund imf provid access kind countri friendli unit state way fund would support taxpay,157,FALSE
1110075076,who voted for the Finance Committee proposal. To say the Republicans have been actively engaged in this process is a misstatement. Here is why we have to go forward. even if we have to meet at 7 in the morning or even if we have to meet this Christmas week. When this bill is passed. we know from the CBO several things will occur. First. 30 million Americans who currently dont have health insurance will have the peace of mind of knowing they have health insurance. Secondly. we know 94 percent of the American people will finally be insuredthe highest percentage in the history of the United States. We know the rates for health insurance premiums will start to come down. as they must. so businesses and individuals can afford it. We know that. finally. consumers across America will be able to stand and fight back when health insurance companies turn them down in their moments of need. We say in this new amendment we are going to say to health insurance companies: You cannot deny coverage to anybody under 18. any child. for a preexisting condition. That is going to bring peace of mind to millions of American families who understand that without this they couldnt get the health insurance they absolutely need for their children. Let me address quickly this notion that this is somehow a mystery amendment. This amendment has now been before the American public for at least 70 hours on the Internet. The bill itself has been before the American public now for more than 3 weeks on the Internet. You can find it not only on the Democratic Senate Web site. you can find it on the Republican Web site. They put our bill on their Web site because they dont have a comprehensive health care reform bill. They put ours up for people to read. There has been ample opportunity for people to read. dissect. and to be critical of it and raise questions about it. Before our final vote. America will have had its chance to read and understand the import of this effort and this effort is substantial. This is something we have built up to for decades. To finally put the Senate on record as to whether we are endorsing the current health care system in America that is unaffordable. discriminates against people. and leaves so many behind. a system that currently rations care and says to 50 million Americans you have no coverage. and to millions of others that you have coverage that will not be there when you need itwe have to bring that to an end. As Senator HARKIN said the other day in closing the debate. this is a real debate over whether health care will be a right or a privilege in America. If you believe it is a privilege for those who are wealthy and well off. then. of course. you will vote against this. If you believe it is a right that should be extended to more Americans.

1110053718,Mr. President. I thank my colleague for his comments. He knows how deeply I respect him and how proud I am that he is the Republican leader on the Judiciary Committee. He will do a terrific job. and has been doing a terrific job. ever since he took over. Considering a Supreme Court nominee is one of this bodys most important responsibilities. I come at this wanting to support whomever the President nominates. The President has the right to nominate aid appoint. and we have a right. it seems to me. to vote up or down one way or the other and determine whether we will consent to the nomination. We can also give advice during this time. Only 110 men and women have so far served on our Nations highest Court. and President Obama has now nominated Judge Sonia Sotomayor to replace Justice David Souter. Our constitutional rule of advise and consent requires us to determine whether she is qualified for this position by looking at her experience and. more importantly. her judicial philosophy. President Obama has already described his understanding of the power and role of judges in our system of government. He has said he will appoint judges who have empathy for certain groups and that personal empathy is an essential ingredient for making judicial decisions. Right off the bat. President Obamas vision of judges deciding cases based on their personal feelings and priorities is at odds with what most Americans believe. A recent national poll found that by more than three to one. Americans reject the notion that judges may go beyond the law as written and -take their personal views and feelings into account. Judge Sotomayor appears to have endorsed this subjective view of judging. In one speech she gave several times over nearly a decade. she endorsed the view that there is actually no objectivity or neutrality in judging. but merely a series of perspectives.

Is it running smoothly? And we got a number today. As I understand it. we set another record. We have a lot of records weve been setting. Unfortunately. they havent been very good ones.

In my State of North Carolina. almost 20 percent of the jobs in construction have been lost during this time period. Clearly. the construction segment of our economy has suffered. Madam Chair. the SBAs 7(a) loans are the loans that are most commonly used by those small businesses engaged in construction. They are being used for many things. They can be used for daytoday capital. for purchasing new equipment that is needed to do the job. construction itself. renovation or refinancing. Many things. many aspects of maintaining a business are used in these SBA 7(a) loans. The amendment that we offer is quite simple. Currently if a business takes out a loan. then payments are due back immediately. The amendment would offer that these payments be deferred for 1 year. that the small businesses engaged in construction have 1 year to start their payments back. This would help these businesses have just a little bit more help towards being successful. We oftentimes. Madam Chair. have relied upon construction to lead us out of recessions. This opportunity will help small businesses that are engaged in construction help lead us out of this recession. Madam Chair.

1110053059,Madam President. as the debate over health care reform continues. a number of different approaches have now emerged. But one thing unites us: All of us agree health care reform is needed. The question is. what kind of reforma reform that cuts costs and expands access or a socalled reform that leads to a government takeover where premiums are increased but health care is delayed. denied. and rationed? The American people want reform. but they want reform that allows them to keep their current insurance while preserving the freedoms. choices. and quality of care they now enjoy. That is why Republicans have proposed a series of reforms to lower costs and improve access. withoutwithoutdestroying what people like about our current health care system. As it turns out. President Obama has said he is open to some of the ideas Republicans have put forward. such as the need to reform our medical liability laws to discourage junk lawsuits and the need to encourage wellness and prevention programs that have proven to be effective in cutting costs and improving care. In fact. during a speech last week to the American Medical Association. the President discussed one particular wellness and prevention program at the Safeway supermarket chain. which has dramatically cut that companys health care costs and employee premiums. The President even said he would be open to helping businesses across the Nation adopt wellness and prevention programs such as the Safeway plan. Yet the bill the Democrats are trying to rush through the Senate would actually ban this program from being copied and implemented by other companies. That makes absolutely no sense. All last week. we heard eyepopping cost estimates for health care proposals coming out of Capitol Hillproposals that wouldnt even solve the entire problem but would bury us deeper and deeper in debt. If the goal is to decrease costs. why wouldnt Democrats in Congress support a plan we know has been effective in doing soespecially if the President himself supports it? One would think this would be an easy bipartisan feature of any Democratic plan. According to Safeway CEO Steve Bard. Safeways per capita health care costs have remained flat even as the per capita health care costs of most American companies have increased by nearly 30 percent since Safeway implemented its wellness and prevention plan back in 2005. Safeways plan has also reduced the health care costs for employees and their families by offering incentives for workers who adopt healthier lifestyles. Those employees who choose to participate in the plan are tested for tobacco usage. for a healthy weight. and for their blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Employees who pass these tests are given discounts on their premiums. For example. if employees pass all four tests. their annual premiums are reduced by $780 for individuals and $1.560 for families. If employees miss their goals the first time. the company provides support for improvement and financial incentives for those who make progress. All of this makes health care more affordable. and it also helps to improve the health and quality of life of Safeways workers. The companys obesity and smoking rates are now about 70 percent of the national average. and employees like the plan so much that 76 percent of them want more incentives that reward healthy behavior. Safeway executives estimate if the United States had adopted its approach in 20054 years agothe countrys direct health care bill would be $550 billion less than it is nowif we had simply adopted the Safeway approach 4 years ago. The Safeway program has proven so successful that the company wants to increase its incentives for rewarding healthy behavior. Unfortunately. current laws restrict it from doing so. but instead of offering legislation that corrects the problem. the socalled reform bill being pushed through the HELP Committee would do the opposite. It would actually prohibit companies from implementing the Safeway program. Let me repeat that: The bill that is currently being pushed through the HELP Committee doesnt let companies consider an employees health status when providing insurancemeaning employers would be banned from rewarding healthy behavior as Safeway does and offering lower premiums to workers who manage their chronic diseases. eliminate highrisk behaviors such as smoking. or lose weight. In other words. it would prohibit companies from implementing programs that have been proven to cut health care costs. I thought that was the point of health care reform. When it comes to making health care more affordable. we should all support ideas that work. Americans want health care ideas that cut costs and improve care. The Safeway model is an excellent place to start. The President supports it. Republicans support it. and Safeways experience has shown that it works. If Democrats in Congress are serious about making health care more affordable. they should support it too. Instead of the rushandspend approach that has led to a chaotic process and hugely expensive health care proposals that dont even address the whole problem. Democrats should slow down and consider ideas that have been shown to not only be effective in delivering care but also effective in reducing costs.

1110057945,"Mr. President. I rise this morning to speak on an issue that so many of us. not only here in Washington in the Senate and in the Congress. generally. but across the country have been concerned about. talking about. debating. and it is the issue. of course. of health care. We have a long way to go over the next couple weeks and months. I know there is a lot of coverage and debate about timing and what is going to happen this week or next week or by the August break. But I believe we are going to get this done. and I think it is important we have a good debate about it. I think too often in this debate we have focused on conflict and controversy as opposed to looking at some substantive parts of this legislation. I start this morning. as I have so many times when I have been discussing this issue over the last couple months. with a constituent. one person. but I think a person who speaks for many people across Pennsylvania and across the country. Her name is Trisha Urban. She sent me a letter back in February that I have noted before. This letter. I think. tells us an awful lot about all we need to know about what is wrong with our health care system right now. Despite all the positive features of itgreat hospitals and medical personnel and people we can be justifiably proud of and boast aboutthere are problems with our health care system. Trisha Urban. when she sent this letter in February. was recounting what had happened in her life just a few weeks before. She talked about her husband Andrew. who had to change positions in life. change jobs because he was completing an internship. She said: Because of preexisting conditions. neither my husbands health issues nor my pregnancy She referred earlier to the fact she was pregnant at the time of the letter... neither my husbands health issues nor my pregnancy would be covered under private insurance. She said: I worked 4 parttime jobs and was not eligible for any health benefits. She says later in the letter that they lost their health insurance coverage. and they had close to $100.000 worth of medical bills. Then she says: Concerned with the upcoming financial responsibility of the birth of our daughter and the burden of current medical expenses. my husband missed his last doctors appointment less than one month ago. And this is how the story ends for this family. She talks aboutjust a few weeks before this letterwhat happened to her. She says: My water had broke the night before. we were anxiously awaiting the birth of our first child. A halfhour later. 2 ambulances were in my driveway. As the paramedics were assessing the health of my baby and me. the paramedics from the other ambulance told me that my husband could not be revived. That is her storya story of not having the kind of health care coverage that she and her husband and her new baby should havethe story of her husband missing his last doctors appointment because of financial burdens and. of course. the tragic part of that story. which is the loss of her husband. the same day her daughter was born. I do not think every story we have told about our constituents ends the same way. But the blessing here of this story. of this letter. is this: Trisha Urban could have said: Do you know what? I have a terrible burden and I cant handle this. and I am not going to try to talk to anyone about it. I am going to carry this burden myself. And she could go off and not be heard from again. But she took the time to write to me. This is how she ends the letter. She does not just tell her tragic story and just say: Can you help me? And: I am in trouble. She thinks beyond herself. She thinks of an issue that is affecting so many Americans. and she says this: I am a working class American and do not have the money or the insight to legally fight the health insurance company. We had no life insurance. I will probably lose my home. my car and everything we worked so hard to accumulate in our life will be gone in an instant. If my story is heard. if legislation can be changed to help other uninsured Americans in a similar situation. I am willing to pay the price of losing everything. That is what Trisha Urban says to us. I would note that in this Senate Chamber. you can go to every single desk100 Senators. including myselfevery single desk. and if you were to ask a Member of the Senate: Do you have health care coverage? They would say: Of course. I am a Federal employee. and I get to choose a lot of options. You could say the same of people who work in the House and in the White House and in executive branch agencies. So individual Senators are taken care of pretty well. So when Trisha Urban says to us in a letter: ""I am willing to pay the price of losing everything."" when she says that. I believe she is not just saying it to tell us what is on her mind. what is in her heart in the aftermath of the tragedy. I believe that line and her letter and her whole story are emblematic of the stories of Americans across the country. I believe all those sentiments and all those details of her life present a challenge to us. I am willing to pay the price of losing everything. she says to us. The question isor I should say one of the important questions isover the next couple of weeks and months. as we debate this issue. what are we willing to lose? What are individual Members of the Senate willing to do and willing to lose to get this done? I believe part of that is having a constructive and thorough and farreaching debate about not just the issues but what is in the legislation. I will spend some time on that this morning and I will for the next couple of weeks. As a member of the Health. Education. Labor and Pensions Committee. we have a bill. Sometimes the fact that there is a bill and there is a lot of positive features to it gets lost in Washington. There is a lot of talk about conflict between Democrats and Republicans. there is a lot of talk about controversy or issues that are sometimes easy to debate or cover. but what has been lost in a lot of this debate over the last couple of weeks is what is in the bill. We are going to get to that. We wont get to all of it today. of course. I believe the bill does a couple of things. First. it ensures that over time we are going to have stable costs. That is one thing American families are looking for. some kind of stability or peace of mind with regard to costs and with regard to other issues as well. So stable costs. I also believe this legislation and the bill we are going to send to President Obama this fall will also have secure choices. If you like what you have. you like the plan you have. you can keep it. It is not going to change. If you want to make a change. you are going to have options. Thirdly. it is about the quality of care. I believe the American people have a right to expect that we are going to control costs. that we are going to provide them with secure choices. but that we are also going to provide quality care. Any old health care. in my judgment. isnt good enough. I believe the bill does all three things: stable costs. secure choices. and quality of care. One of the threshold questions we have to answer in this debate isbecause it is going to be a choice. We are not going to have a choice between 10 options on health care in a general sense or 5 options. we are going to have a basic. fundamental choice. as we do on a lot of issues. It is going to be one or the other. A or B. or A versus B. maybe. and here is the choice. The first question we have to answer is do we want to keep the status quo. do we want to keep perpetuating a system which has costs out of control for families and for businesses. for government. which doesnt offer the kind of quality care across the boardsome get it. we know that. and it is good carebut is there enough quality care across the board? I would argue there isnt. Are we going to offer that and say it got too tough and we werent willing to take some risks with an important bill. we decided to not do anything? That is the status quo. That is what we have now. The other choice is change and reform. President Obama. fortunately. as a new President of the United States. has chosen to be about the business of reform and change. He has said to us. and I believe the American people have said to us: We cannot stay where we are. We cannot allow a system to perpetuate the problems we have right now. So that is the fundamental choice: the status quo. do nothing. or change and reform. working with President Obama and listening to the voices of the American people. people such as Trisha Urban and so many others. So when we debate thisthe status quo. stay where we are. versus change and reformwe have to begin to examine some of the questions the American people are worried about. They are worried about costs. They are worried about change and legislation not leading to a control of costs. the kind of stability we want. One of the questions we are not spending much time in Washington debating is: What is the cost of doing nothing? What is the cost of doing nothing? What is the cost of the status quo? Well. fortunately. some people have begun to examine that. One of the examinations of that is a report by Families USA. and the report is entitled ""The Clock Is Ticking."" It says: ""More Americans Losing Health Coverage."" One of the points it has madeand of course I wont read the whole reportbut one of the points it has made in the report is this: Here is what the status quo means. here is what no change means: 44.230 more people losing health coverage every week. The report also goes on to talk about what it means in individual States. a State such as Pennsylvania where they are projecting over the next couple of years tens and tens and tens of thousands of people losing their coverage. By one estimate in this report. 178.000 more people just in Pennsylvaniajust in Pennsylvanialosing their coverage. I ask unanimous consent that this report.

1110051150,Mr. Speaker. its not surprising to me that the chairman of the Rules Committee continues to reserve her time and that there are few Democrats who have come down to the floor to defend this terrible rule or this embarrassing bill that the rule brings to the floor. Its a disgrace what happened last night. After only a few minutes of debate. legitimate debate on legitimate amendments. the majority moves to rise. goes back to the Rules Committee. and writes a rule that slams down more than 80 Republican amendments.a number of Democratic amendments too. but far more Republican amendments. without any consideration whatsoever. We have heard from some of those speakers here just in the last few minutes. people who had good. sound amendments to offer. But I would like to talk about the overall bill. Thats my concern. This bill spends $64.31 billion. an 11.7 percent increase. Now. where is that money coming from? Every penny of that increase is going to be borrowed. In fact. the budget that the Democrats adopted for this coming year that this appropriations bill is a part of spends $1.2 trillion more than is coming in in revenues. $3.6 trillion in expenditures. $2.4 trillion in revenues coming ina $1.2 trillion deficit in 1 year. Until this year we have never hAd a single year in our Nations history where we have had more than a $500 billion deficit. and $500 billion is a staggering amount of money. And yet the budget they just adopted for the next 10 years. every single year it exceeds $550 billion. rising. until at the end of the 10 years about $700 billion.

1110058692,"Mr. President. I want to talk about an amendment I offered that has been ruled nongermane by the Parliamentarian. I flatly disagree with that ruling. and I want the American people to understand what we have ruled nongermane. We offered an amendment that said grants and contracts under this bill should be competitively bid. Think about that. When we go out to spend moneywith the six or seven exemptions in the contracting clause. and the fact that maybe for some things only one person can apply to it. which have been accepted in thatwe said for American taxpayers to get value. we ought to ask and mandate that competitive bidding take place on grants and contracts in this bill. Not one of these has ever passed the Senate. and I want to tell you why. It is because we do not want things to be competitively bid. We do not want your dollars to be spent wisely. efficiently. and effectively because when we do that we take away our political power to say somebody is going to get a contract or somebody is going to get a grant. So this amendment. which was offered. specifically excluded earmarks because the complaint last week. when I offered the same amendment on the previous bill. was that if they are authorizedand remember. an earmark goes to a specific person. a specific company. those well connected in WashingtonI specifically eliminated earmarks from this amendment so we would not have the excuse to say we do not want things competitively bid. But what we were going to find. had this amendment gone to a vote. is that it would have been voted down. too. because the problem is not in America. the problem is right here. We view political power and incumbency more precious than we view the economic realities and sustenance of this country and the true freedom of the people in this country. We diminish that because we think our positions ought to be enhanced. and we ought to secure our next election by making sure we are the dolers of everything good. and that we can actually connect those who give big campaign contributions to great rewards from the Congress when it comes to appropriations bills. What this amendment would do is require that the contract be competitively bid according to the law. We actually have a law that says contracts have to be competitively bid. except Congress routinely excuses that on appropriations bills. Just so the American people get this. we dont competitively bid contracts on these appropriations bills. We dont competitively bid the grants. We dont mandate that they are competitively bid. although some grants are competitionbased but not based on dollars. based on performance. So Congress wins and the American people lose. Every time one of these bills goes through here without competitive bidding. our children are the real losers. The President of the United States has said it is his policy that anything over $25.000 the government buys in this country ought to be competitively bid. Yet routinely it is his supporters who vote against that. President Obama means it. but we cant get it through here. We have $350 billion a year of documented waste. fraud. and duplication in the discretionary budget. plus Medicare fraud every year. There has been no attempt to accept amendments to eliminate that. to lessen that. The fact is. we are on idle pilot to grow this government 8 percent this year in spite of the $787 billion stimulus. If you are sitting at home thinking about that. not very many people have 8 percent more income this year. So one of two things is going to happen in the next 18 months in this country. Here is what is going to happen. Either we are going to default on our debt because people are going to quit loaning us money or the average middleincome taxpayer is going to see a tax hike because. if we take all the income of the top 5 percent of people in this country. we cut our deficit only in half. If we take all the incomeI am talking about a 100percent tax rate of the top 5 percent earners in this countrywe will cut our deficit in half. So if you are a middleclass American. no matter whether you think some people should pay more than they do5 percent pays 80 percent of the taxes in this countryyou can bet that in the next 18 months. you are going to see a middleclass tax increase go through this body. The reason it is going to go through is because we will not apply any common sense to the appropriations bills. Most American families are cutting back on their spending. some because they have lost their jobs. others because they are worried and they are fearful. What is the Federal Government doing? I am not talking about the stimulus bill. We are actually increasing spending. We are not making the hard choices about what is a priority and what is not. what is a necessity and what is not. We are not eliminating anything. We are building up everything. just like the last amendment we talked about. There is absolutely zero need for that program in the Department of Agriculture. but next year we will have the same debate again. I have an amendment on cheeses. I am not going to do it because there is no reason to waste the Senates time. But we created a demonstration project back in the early 1990s with Wisconsin and Vermont and we have been funding it ever since. They have this outstanding large specialty cheese production in Wisconsin and Vermont. They dont need any money. but we are going to send them more money this year because we did last year. The fact is. the specialty cheeses they make cost two and three times what regular cheese costs and they are luxury items. but we are going to fund that not because they need it. not because they are not competitive. not because they havent grown their industry. but because we have funded it before. Now ask yourself. if you read the Constitution. where is it in the Constitution that we are supposed to give two States millions and millions of dollars for an agricultural program that should be funded by the State if they want to do it or funded by the individuals who actually produce the cheese and are making good money. But we are going to continue to do it. So I am not going to offer that amendment. I am not going to waste the time of the Senate on it. But there is a real question of why we are in the trouble we are in as a nation today. It is because we ignore what the Constitution tells us to do. We ignore what our oath tells us to do. what we swear to do. which is uphold the Constitution. And within that is the enumerated powers. as well as the 10th amendment. The 10th amendment says whatever is not specifically spelled outspecificand if you read what Jefferson and Madison had to say about what that meant. you will find that all of those responsibilities are left to the States and to the people. That is what they said. We have this ""cash for clunkers"" going on right now. and the Senate is going to vote for an increase in that program. But the reason we are having to do that is because we cant manage it. We have proventhe Department of Transportationthey dont even know how many applications they have from people. They dont even know if they have over the number. What they know is they have approved $760 million of the money so far. but that doesnt count all of the applications that have come in from the dealers. Here we are incentivizing the purchase of cars. taking money from our grandkids. and Americans are smart enough to know if they can get 4.500 bucks back from the Federal Government. they will take advantage of that. So we have created this wonderful increase in demand for automobiles. But why not an increase in demand for boats or how about RVs or how about refrigerators? They are more efficient. Why not give somebody a $500 credit on their refrigerator? Why are we limiting this to the automobile industry that we now as taxpayers have the responsibility of bailing out of debt? The fact is. we are clueless. We are not plugged in to what the average American family is going through in terms of a budget. We will not apply that same standard to their money up here. and their kids. our kids. and our grandkids are the ones who are going to suffer. So ask yourself a question: Why would the Senate not allow an amendment on competitively bidding the contracts and grants in this bill? Hundreds of millions of dollars that we are going to pay much too much for. an area where we could save a tremendous amount of money. and if it is grant programs that truly do a great job. we could get more of that great job done if we got it done more efficiently. It is pretty disturbing that we are so far off course with what we are doing and. more importantly. how we are doing it. With that.

1110015120,"Mr. President. I thank the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. through whose committee this legislation is proceeding. I appreciate the frustration felt by the residents of the District of Columbia at the absence of a vote in Congress. I fully understand and appreciate that. I also believe it is important that we look back at both the Constitution itself and the intention of our Founding Fathers. which was to create the District of Columbia as a base of Government. According to many experts. the District of Columbia is not a State. so therefore is not entitled to that representation. Also. one has to raise the obvious question: If the District of Columbip is entitled to a Representative in the U.S. House of Representatives. then why isnt it also entitled to two Senators? If the District of Columbia is entitled to a Member of Congress. why isnt Puerto Rico. which would probably entail 9 or 10 Members of Congress? Why are other territories of the United States not entitled to fullfledged Members of the U.S. House of Representatives and. indeed. the U.S. Senate? After great deliberation and debate. our Foundiiqg Fathers enshrined in the Constitution. 222 years ago. a unique form of government that proposes a distribution of D~ower and checks and balances on each branch. So. too. the Founding Fathers considered and provided for a unique Federal city to serve as our Nations seat of government. No single Member would represent the interest of the District but all Members of Congress would share responsibility for the citys wellbeing. I believe that when you look at distribution of tax revenues and when you look at other measurements. the District of Columbia has been well represented by all Members of Congress. The Framers specifically limited voting representation in the House of Representatives to States. Article I. section 2. of the Constitution provides unequivocally: The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second year by the People of the several States. If they had wanted the District of Columbia to have the representation. they would have designated so in the Constitution. Asked to opine on the meaning of the word ""States"" in the context of House representation. Federal courts have consistently accorded that word its plain meaning. concluding that the word ""States"" does not include territories or possessions or even the District of Columbia. Again. I express my sympathy for the residents of the District of Columbia. But to now act in direct contravention to the intent and words of our Founding Fathers. I believe. is a violation of the Constitution of the United States. And to somehow work a deal that includes the State of Utah having an additional seat in return for that is an incredible violation. I will talk more about that. First. I wish to say that it is very clear the Congress simply cannot amend the Constitution by legislationno matter how noble the cause. Congress has once before pursued an appropriate constitutional resolution to this issue. In 1978. Congress passed a joint resolution proposing to amend the Constitution to provide for the representation for the District of Columbia in Congress. Seven years later. that resolution failed to obtain the required approval of the 38 States necessary for ratification under article V of the Constitution. There is no reason proponents of voting rights for the District cant pursue this process again. There is a process for amending the Constitution of the United States. There is no reason why those residents of the District of Columbia. and other supporters. should not pursue the legitimate process of amending the Constitution of the United States. It. should not be done and. in my view. cannot be done. The courts will decide. if we dont decide here. that it is unconstitutional to do so. I welcome such a process. rather than the consideration of this bill. which is clearIy unconstitutionalnot only in my judgment but in the overwhelming body of legal opinion. In addition to being unconstitutional. as I said. I am concerned that this bill is more a product of politics than of principle. Look at what this legislation before us does. It doesnt simply grant the District of Columbia a voting seat in the House. it adds another congressional seat for the State of Utah. The obvious question is. Why Utah? Why not Arizona or Nevada or New Jersey? As a representative of the people of the State of Arizona. who. I believe. legitimately and continuously. as one of the fastest growing States. have been deprived of additional seats because of the way the census was conductedand now we are going to give a seat to the State of Utah on the grounds that the census was not accurate. I dont know of any fastgrowing State in America that doesnt believe we were undercountedand legitimatelyin the census. Now. as I understand itand maybe the proponents of an additional seat for Utah can more eloquently and convincingly describe it than I canthey are saying it is because they came closest in the census to being eligible for another seat in the Congress. The State of Nevada is the fastest growing State in America. Arizona has been among those that are fast growing. But why Utah? What in the world does an additional seat for Utah have to do with representation for the District of Columbia? It can only be interpreted in one way. and that is an attempt to buy votes. We are talking about the Constitution of the United States here. about representation in the Congress of the United States of America. not some political deal. I have sympathy for the State of Utah if they think they were undercounted in the census. I have sympathy for all States that were undercounted in the census. What some supporters -of the bill argue is that Utah is the next State in line to receive a House seat after the last census in 2000 and reapportionment. Nevada was the fastest growing State from 1986 to 2004. until Arizona overtook Nevada as the fastest growing State in 2006. according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Nevada. once again. regained this title for its high growth between 2006 and 2007. For the first time in over 25 years. Utah was listed this year as the fastest growing State. as its population climbed 2.5 percent. with Arizona being second. with a population growth of 2.3 percent. Despite this percentage growth. Texas. California. North Carolina. and Georgia added more people than Utah. Nevada. or Arizona between 2007 and 2008. Mr. President. we are getting on a slippery slope here. Do you judge it by percentage of growth. numbers of votes? It brings us back to a final question: What in the world would awarding an additional seat to another State have to do with voting rights for the District of Columbia? I have provided those statistics to illustrate there are other States that have experienced far more phenomenal growth than Utah. I love Utah. It is a wonderful State. But the wheels were greased for Utah to receive an additional seat well before it was listed as the fastest growing State this year. And if the State of Utah or any other State was undercounted. that should be taken into consideration. we should fix the census in the year 2010 and make sure any injustice is corrected. But to somehow say we are going to award a State an additional seat not in keeping with the process of how reapportionment is conducted every 10 years is remarkable and certainly unconstitutional. In 2004. lawmakers began floating an idea of a compromise bill to balance a House seat for the District of Columbia. which obviously we assume would be won by a Democrat. with a seat for a congressional district in Utah. which most assume would be won by a Republican. The May 3. 2005. editorial in the Washington Post called this a ""winwin situation."" While this may be a winwin situation for Washington. DC. and Utah. it is hardly a win for the millions of Americans who are living in highgrowth States. In fact. accQrding to a report by the Congressional Research Service. if the District was considered to be a State during the last apportionment. North Carolina would not have gained a seat. According to a study by the Republican policy committee. if this bill is enacted and the House of Representatives is expanded to 437 seats. then New Jersey would keep a congressional seat it would otherwise lose. Again. this illustrates there are winners and losers in an apportionment. but these districts should be chosen based on concrete data from the census. not by political parties attempting to craft legislation that flies in the face of our Founding Fathers intentions. In a February 6. 2009. editorial. the Los Angeles Times states: This is obviously partisan horsetrading. The Los Angeles Times is right. Yes. partisan horse trading happens all the time. but this time partisan horse trading would do grave violence to our Constitution. A commentator wrote in the February 13. 2009. edition of the Washington Times: ... the enactment of blatantly unconstitutional legislation to bypass the constitutional amendment process and give the District of Columbia a seat in the House of Representatives in a crass triumph of raw political power over the rule of law. I couldnt agree more. Again. I regret I am unable to support this legislation to provide the residents of the District voting representation in the House of Representatives. However. I took a solemn oath to defend our Constitution as a U.S. Senator. In testifying before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in 2007. Professor Jonathan Turley described this horse trading as ""the most premeditated unconstitutional act by Congress in decades."" We. as Senators. cannot avoid the constitutional issue. While the Supreme Court may be the final arbiter of constitutionality. Congress. as the first branch of Government. has an independent duty to consider the constitutionality of. the bills we pass. especially where. as here. our own independent Congressional Research Service advises that ""although not beyond question. it would appear likely that the Congress does not have authority to grant voting representation in the House of Representatives to the District of Columbia"" as contemplated by this bill. . S2436 We really have two aspects of this legislation. First of all. does Congress have the constitutional authority to grant voting rights or an additional seat in the House of Representatives by legislation rather than amending the Constitution of the United States? As I pointed out earlier in my statement. the fact is. it was tried in 1978 in the proper fashion and did not receive the approval of the 38 States necessary to amend the Constitution. So now we are trying to basically amend the Constitution of the United States by legislation. That is not in keeping with the authority and responsibility of the Congress of the United States of America. The second is. of course. what in the world does granting voting rights to the District of Columbia have to do with granting another seat to another State? One can only interpret that. as one of the editorials did. as political horse trading. There is no constitutional basis for granting a seat to any State in the United States of America without it being backed up. as laid out by our Founding Fathers. by the results of a census. I will agree. as I have said before. coming from a State that has been consistently undercounted in our population. the census needs to be fixed to more accurately reflect the true population of every State in America. and that has not happened with the fastest growing States. But to grant a seat to a State because they were ""fastest growing"" and maybe closest to the requirement for an additional seat turns everything on its head. What kind of a precedent would we be setting by legislation allowing a State to have another seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. with thousands of votes that would be taken? I also would like to mention. again. if the District of Columbia deserves a voting representative in the U.S. House of Representatives. doesnt the District of Columbia also deserve two U.S. Senators? How intellectually do you make the argument. they deserve a vote in the other body. a coequal bodyalthough we certainly .do not recognize that very often. But the fact is. it is a coequal body. They are going to have a vote over there. but they are not going to have representation over here. Finally. I would like to point out that we have territories in which citizens of the United States reside. Those who were born in those territories. according to a U.S. Supreme Court decision. are citizens of the United States. In fact. they are even eligible to run for President of the United States if they are born in a U.S. territory. What about Puerto Rico? What about the Virgin Islands? What about the Marianas? What about other territories that are part of the United States of America and in which our citizens also reside who then vote for Representatives in the other body. but thbse Representatives obviously do not have voting power? I conclude by saying this is a serious issue. It is a serious issue. It has been clouded by the understandable concern that Members of Congress have for the people who reside in the District of Columbia. We see their license plates every day: ""Taxation without Representation."" But the way to give them those voting rights is through amending the Constitution of the United States. not a legislative act that clearly is not within the constitutional authority granted by our Founding Fathers to the Congress of the United States. I look forward to a spirited debate pn this issue. I think it is an important one. If this DC voting rights bill does pass and this constitutional point of order is rejected by a majority of the Senate. I have very little doubt that the courts of the United States of America will reject this proposal. Again. I appreciate and admire and respect the manager of this bill. the distinguished chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. and the sen- ior ranking member. the Senator from Maine. But I think there is a huge credibility problem when you add on a provision for adding a seat to a State for which there is not any factual or. frankly. rational argument for except that perhaps this measure will gain more support. I urge my colleagues to take a very close look at what we are doing. The most sacred obligation we have is to respect and preserve the Constitution of the United States of America in everything we do. I have very little doubt this legislation before us violates the Constitution of the United States of America.

1110024889,Mr. President. I rise to speak regarding amendment No. 688. the CrapoCorker amendment. I say to the Senator from Michigan. this is an opportunity for us all to say yes. This is an amendment that is very important to people all across the country. What this amendment does is it gives the FDIC the ability to have a line of credit that today is at $30 billion. and it gives them a line of credit up to $100 billion. The FDIC was put in place in 1991 when banking assets in our country were at $4.5 trillion. Today. bank assets in our country total almost $14.7 trillion. We have an FDIC today that is hamstrung because of the financial crisis in which we find ourselves. So this amendment would raise that line of credit from $30 billion. which is an ancient establishment. to $100 billion. Secondly. what it would do is give the FDICwith certain signatures required from the Fed. from the Treasury. from othersaccess to a $500 billion line of credit in the event they need it to seize an institution to protect depositors. So this does two things. To make this relevant to people who will be voting on this amendment. hopefully. this afternoon. I think all of my colleagues know the FDIC has just put in place a special assessment. My guess is every person in this body has heard from community bankers and regional bankers and even larger establishments about this special assessment. I know in Tennessee. many of the community banks actually would have to spend an entire quarters earnings to pay this special assessment. So by doing what we are doing in this amendment. we actually give the FDIC time to amortize that special assessment over a number of years which will cause it to be far more palatable for community bankers. in particular. who have had nothing whatsoever to do with the financial crisis in which we find ourselves. Secondlyand I think this ought to be equally important to people herethis gives the FDIC the ability to move into an organization quickly and to seize it to protect depositors accounts. I know right now the fund is running thin. My guess is that could affectand actually the FDIC has lobbied for thisthis might affect future actions if they dont feel as though they have the resources necessary to go into an organization to do the things they need to do to make sure depositors are protected. This action is action for which I would imagine we could almost get unanimous support. As a matter of fact. my guess iswe could voice vote this. As a matter of fact. I hope that will occur this afternoon. In the past. this legislation has been held hostage to what is called the cramdown provision. The cramdown provision has been before this body. It was defeated overwhelmingly. Numbers of Democrats thought it was bad legislation. There have been a few Senators who have tried to attach cramdown to this legislation that we will be voting on this afternoon and tried to extort action on cramdown by virtue of holding this very good piece of policy at bay. It is my hope this afternoon that we will do something that is very important. especially to community bankers across the country but also to depositors to make sure we have the ability to protect them: that the FDIC has the ability to move quickly. Move aside from extortionary politics and move toward doing something that is good for our country. good for community bankers. and certainly very good for depositors all across this country.

1110050801,"Mr. Chairman. in closing. as we look at this bill. I know there is going to be a series of amendments at different times. and I think a lot of the amendments that will be offered will be from .Members who are very sincerely concerned about the economic crisis that our. country faces. There was an article today in Reuters. Let me read it to the Members here. It says: ""New York Reuters: Technical analyst Robert Prechter on Monday said he sees the United States losing its top AAA credit rating by the end of 2010. as he stuck by a deeply bearish outlook on the U.S. economy and stock market. ""Prechter. known for predicting the 1987 stock market crash. joins a growiig group of market heavyweights in forecasting the United States will lose its top credit rating as the government issues trillions of dollars in debt to fund efforts to bail out the.economy. ""Fears about the longterm vulnerability of the prized U.S. credit rating came to the fore after Standard & Poors in May lowered its outlook on Britain. threatening the U.K.s top AAA rating. That move raised fears that the United States could face a similar risk. with the hefty amounts of government debt issued in both countries to pay for financial rescues causing budget deficits to swell."" So as Members offer these. I would just say there are some things there that are important in the country. We have got to get control of spending. But in other areas. our country is facing a crisisin the area of science. Last year China and India graduated 700.000 engineers. and we only graduated 70.000. and 40 percent of our engineers are foreign students who are returning to their country. And. lastly. in the space program. we have 95.000 engineers working on the space program. But China has 200.000. And unless we do some fairly dramatic things. our factories will close and we will lose the edge in science and engineering. So we need to gain control of the entitlement spending. and I hope to be able to -offer an amendment to the Financial Services bill. Im going to offer an amendment that sets up a bipartisan commission to put every spending program on the table. every spending program in the government on the table. and give that bipartisan commission an opportunity to then go around the country holding public hearings. but to send a proposal up to Congress and require the Congress to vote on it. So I understand the frustration of many of the Members when they see this Congress failing to address the fundamental issues o spending in the Congress.

1110026634,I was pleased to introduce the Vision Care for Kids Act with my colleagues Congressmen GREEN. SULLIVAN. and ENGEL and Congresswoman RoSLEHTINEN in both this Congress and in the previous Congress. This important legislation will establish a federal grant program to provide for timely diagnostic examination. treatment. and followup vision care for children. which will complement existing State programs and allow eye exams for a vulnerable pediatric population that do not qualify for Medicaid or SCHIP and do not have access to private health insurance. This issue has long been near to my heart. In fact. in 2003. I first championed legislation to create a grant program to provide comprehensive eye exams and necessary followup care for children whose families do not have the resources for or access to such care. Preventive vision care is critically important to avoid vision loss. and even blindness. in our nations children. which can affect a childs physical. emotional. and intellectual development. The CDC states that approximately 1.8 million children under the age of 18 are blind or have some form of visual impairment. Fortunately. in most cases. vision loss can be avoided with early diagnosis and treatment. Eye health has a direct impact on learning and achievement. and unfortunately. many visual deficits are caught only after they have impaired a childs early and most critical education. Consequently. it is a national disgrace that only one in three children receive preventive vision care before they are enrolled in elementary school. This essential legislation will provide the tools to significantly mitigate the effects of visual impairment. In fact. H.R. 577 has the potential to open up a new world of academic and social opportunity for approximately half a million of our youngest children nationwide. As Congress continues its work to improve the health care and educational opportunities available to children in this country. the need to remove outside impediments to learning must be addressed to achieve longterm success. I would like to thank Chairman WAXMAN and Chairman PALLONE. for their thoughtful consideration and support for preventive vision care for children. and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Vision Care for Kids Act. Finally. I encourage theSenate to expeditiously consider this essential legislation to provide necessary vision care to our nations most vulnerable children.,111120740,PASCRELL,BILL,H,NJ,M,D,8,voting,2009-03-30,408,Mr. PASCRELL,23867,23925,03302009.txt,2440,382,111,2009,pleas introduc vision care kid act colleagu congressmen green sullivan engel congresswoman roslehtinen congress previou congress import legisl establish feder grant program provid time diagnost examin treatment followup vision care children complement exist state program allow eye exam vulner pediatr popul qualifi medicaid schip access privat health insur issu long near heart fact first champion legisl creat grant program provid comprehens eye exam necessari followup care children whose famili resourc access care prevent vision care critic import avoid vision loss even blind nation children affect child physic emot intellectu develop cdc state approxim million children age blind form visual impair fortun case vision loss avoid earli diagnosi treatment eye health direct impact learn achiev unfortun mani visual deficit caught impair child earli critic educ consequ nation disgrac one three children receiv prevent vision care enrol elementari school essenti legisl provid tool significantli mitig effect visual impair fact hr potenti open new world academ social opportun approxim half million youngest children nationwid congress continu work improv health care educ opportun avail children countri need remov outsid impedi learn must address achiev longterm success would like thank chairman waxman chairman pallon thought consider support prevent vision care children urg colleagu vote favor vision care kid act final encourag thesen expediti consid essenti legisl provid necessari vision care nation vulner children,218,FALSE
1110017615,"Madam Speaker. its a great honor for me to be here tonight to join with many of my colleagues from The Majority Makers. the Class of 2006. which brought change to the Congress. and now hopes to join with President Obama to bring change to the country. Were here tonight to talk about the challenges facing this country that are manifold. the incredible. unprecedented nature of our situation. the opportfnities that we face. because every challenge comes with opportunities. and also to talk about the budget that President Obama has proposed to this Congress. because it is a budget that takes us in a very different direction in this country. echoing and reinforcing his theme of his campaign. which was to bring change to the country. And its also the motivation for all of us who came to Congress in the Class of 2006. E 1730 You know. I have the great privilege of serving on the Ways and Means Committee and also on the Budget Committee. Over the last 2 days. weve heard Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner and OMB Director Peter Or~zag talking about what the situation is in the countrythe economic challenges we in the world faceand also what the Obama administration plans to do about them in asking for our assistance. Two things have been very clear in listening to both of these two gentlemen. who are new to their jobs. in listening to the new administration and also in listening to our colleagues on the other side of the aisle as theyre responding to the initiatives of the administration. The two things are: One. that they like to Lake potshots at the budget. which is fair game. because this is. after all. sometimes a partisan exercise. Also. the ideas that they bring to the debate are really no new ideas at all. As a matter of fact. listening to Republicans talk about the economic situation and their suggestions for how we move forward is kind of like listening to the coach of the Detroit Lions saying. ""hey. use my playbook."" after they just went 0 and 16. I dont want to pick on the Detroit Lions. but thats really what it sounds like because they bring no new ideas to the table. Thats what is so impressive about this team that President Obama has assembled and about the budget that he has brought to the Congress and to the American people. It is a budget that is full of new ideas and of new approaches to very old and very difficult problems. So. as were here tonight to talk about where weve been and where were going and where we need to go in this- country. I just want to mention the fact that Prime Minister Gordon Brown was here today. The theme of his address to the joint session of Congress wasand he has mentioned the expression many times-""faith in the future."" Thats really what were trying to bring to this country. faith in the future. because that faith has been destroyed over the last decade in the United States. and thats what we are so committed to doing. and I think thats what the Obama administration is committed to doing as well. to restoring faith in the future. because that is also what has driven our country. our people. our businesses. and our institutions. which is that we believe there is a better time facing us. a better time ahead. and we have taken those steps. We have worked as hard as we can and have used our ingenuity to realize the future that we all aspire to.

1110048710,Youre absolutely right. Congresswoman SCHMIDT. They are all across America and they are doing a fabulous job. They do it on very little money. They arent receiving money from the Federal Government the same way that Planned Parenthood does. Planned Parenthood receives well over $300 million a year in grants from the Federal taxpayer. We dont see that for these prolife centers. And these are centers who people give donations to. And for women who find themselves in a situation where theyre torn. trying to figure out what they should do about this unplanned pregnancy. Mrs. SCHMIDT is -exactly right. because they offer not only just the sonogram and just a pregnancy test. but they offer clothes if you need maternity clothes. They offer baby clothes. They offer a little bassinet. They might offer a stroller. a little baby carrier. free diapers. They are there to help women at their most vulnerable time. And you will find in a Planned Parenthood that a woman walks in and they say that theyre full service. but there is actually only one option usually when you go into Planned Parenthood. and thats to end the life of that little baby. And what the prolife centers try to do is offer women lifegiving choices and to let them know they can keep their dignity. Whether they choose to keep their baby or not. they can keep their dignity. but they can give the greatest gift they can ever give. and thats that they givethe gift of life to the next generation. Its one of the most beautiful decisions than can ever be made. Youve had the pleasure of being a mother. Ive had the pleasure of being a mother. and it is truly one of the greatest treasures anyone can ever have. to be entrusted with giving life to the next generation. So I think as we start this discussion on abortion. on what it means. and there are a lot of opinions on either side. but one thing we have seen that has occurred recently. the American people. for the first time. the public opinions show that over. 51 percent of Americans claim they are prolife. This is one of the highest ratings weve ever seen. Part of that. I think. is because of science. because science shows us the human development of the unborn child.. And the more that we learn about the unborn child. the fascination. the intricacy. the beauty of the unborn child. the more we embrace giving life to this beautiful treasure and to this beautiful gift. And that brings us to our subject this evening. dealing with D.C.. and there are a few things I wanted to mention in my remarks. The taxpayer funding of abortion also increases the number of abortions. So when we put tax money into the equation. well get more abortions. And it makes sense. Its practical. And thats acc6rding to the Alan Guttmacher Institute. which is the research arm of Planned Parenthood. The Guttmacher Institute also routinely reports showing that when public funding isnot available. 30 percent fewer women who receive Medicaid have abortions. Now. this is interesting because it means 30 percent more babies whose mothers receive governmentsubsidized health care survive because of abortionfunding restrictions. And this is. I think. particularly important for women and men in the African American communities.. in the Latino communities. In communities of color. we see a very high percentage of abortions. And I know one of our colleagues. Congressman TRENT FRANKS. speaks about this often. He has a tremendous heart. as we do as well. for unborn children in the minority community because such a grossly high percentage of babies in the African American/Latino community are aborted. and we dont want to see that. These babies add to the richness of the American fabric just as Caucasian babies do. All babies are valuable. but what were seeing is an even higher percentage of babies who are losing their lives in the minority community. In particular. we see this with minorities as they access Medicaid funding. If they have Medicaid funding. government funding. well see more abortions. and well see that particularly in the minority communities. This is a commonground issue. I think. that we can share with those who embrace a proabortion view and with those who embrace a prolife view because the polls have shown very clearly that the majority of Americans do not support taxpayerfunded abortion. They dont support it. We are here to represent the will and the interests of the American people. Thats not where the American people are right now. They dont want to see us spending their money when we dont have much. when this government is in the redin red ink up to our eyeballs. We dont have money to pay for the intentional murder of unborn children. The Obama budget changes this Dornan amendment. as my colleague Mrs. SCHMIDT has said. to the Financial Services appropriations bill. so the publicly funded abortions will. once again. be available in the District of Columbia. Right here where we stand this evening. this is the District of Columbia. So now. once again. President Obama is expanding abortion. Instead of making it rare. instead of making it safer. this is making more abortions. particularly for preborn babies of color. The District of Columbia has a record of abusing taxpayer funds for abortion. Its bad news. but its true news. In the 80s when the District had the most permissive abortion funding policy in this country. abortions were funded for anyone. not just for Medicaid recipients. Elizabeth Reveal was the D.C. budget director at the time. She confirmed that the Districts government has a policy of funding abortion on demand and does not attempt to determine the circumstances of the pregnancy. D.C. allows minorsthats childrento receive abortion services without the consent of their parents. So imagine that. Here in D.C.. children can receive abortions without their parents consent. which means that the American taxpayer will be funding abortions. paying for them for children. - and minors could easily be brought in from other States. Remember. D.C. is only about 10 miles square. so minors could be transported across State lines and brought to D.C. from other States to have abortions paid for bythe American taxpayer right here in Washington. D.C. to avoid the parental notification laws in their home States. Thats according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute. According to .Planned Parenthood. they dont have accurate numbers on abortions in D.C. due to women from other States coming to D.C. for abortions. There are problems here with this. deep problems with this measure. Thats why we had the Dornap amendment. It made sense. It was only reasonable. So. unfortunately. under the Obama administration. we are taking the BandAid off this problem and are exposing it to even more infection. The -infection is more money. and we know that more money will lead to more abortions and particularly to more abortions for babies of color. This is really a sad story. We dont want to just talk about sad stories. because life is such a wonderful story. We would love to just be here this evening and talk about the positive story of lifeand its a beautiful storybut this is a really ugly story because its about expanding more abortion. its about more misery for women who are forced into abortions often against their will. who are given incomplete and inadequate information and who may be headed for a lifetime of addiction. depression or of a sense of loss and grief that they may have to deal with for 10. 15. 20 years. We dont want this to happen. We want women to be dignified. We dont want women to be brutalized. Thats why were here this evening. because we really believe in women. and we believe in womens choices and in empowering women. This doesnt empower women to put them in a .situation where theyre forced to do something quite often by pressure from boyfriends who are careless or from parents who dont want to be bothered. So I just want to. again. thank Representative JEAN SCHMIDT. She has a heart of love. She has a heart of love on this issue. With her courage and with her dignity. she has brought together this group of men and women here on the House floor this evening who believe very strongly that American women will be hurt by this bill. Certainly. American children will be hurt by this bill.  I thank you for your courage in bringing this forward this evening.,111117480,BACHMANN,MICHELE,H,MN,F,R,6,voting,2009-06-10,763,Mrs. BACHMANN,53203,53451,06102009.txt,8372,1437,111,2009,your absolut right congresswoman schmidt across america fabul job littl money arent receiv money feder govern way plan parenthood plan parenthood receiv well million year grant feder taxpay dont see prolif center center peopl give donat women find situat theyr torn tri figur unplan pregnanc mr schmidt exactli right offer sonogram pregnanc test offer cloth need matern cloth offer babi cloth offer littl might offer stroller littl babi carrier free diaper help women vulner time find plan parenthood woman walk say theyr full servic actual one option usual go plan parenthood that end life littl babi prolif center tri offer women lifegiv choic let know keep digniti whether choos keep babi keep digniti give greatest gift ever give that giveth gift life next gener one beauti decis ever made youv pleasur mother ive pleasur mother truli one greatest treasur anyon ever entrust give life next gener think start discuss abort mean lot opinion either side one thing seen occur recent american peopl first time public opinion show percent american claim prolif one highest rate weve ever seen part think scienc scienc show us human develop unborn child learn unborn child fascin intricaci beauti unborn child embrac give life beauti treasur beauti gift bring us subject even deal dc thing want mention remark taxpay fund abort also increas number abort put tax money equat well get abort make sens practic that alan guttmach institut research arm plan parenthood guttmach institut also routin report show public fund isnot avail percent fewer women receiv medicaid abort interest mean percent babi whose mother receiv governmentsubsid health care surviv restrict think particularli import women men african american commun latino commun commun color see high percentag abort know one colleagu congressman trent frank speak often tremend heart well unborn children minor commun grossli high percentag babi african commun abort dont want see babi add rich american fabric caucasian babi babi valuabl see even higher percentag babi lose live minor commun particular see minor access medicaid fund medicaid fund govern fund well see abort well see particularli minor commun commonground issu think share embrac proabort view embrac prolif view poll shown clearli major american support taxpayerfund abort dont support repres interest american peopl that american peopl right dont want see us spend money dont much govern red ink eyebal dont money pay intent murder unborn children obama budget chang dornan amend colleagu mr schmidt said financi servic appropri bill publicli fund abort avail district columbia right stand even district columbia presid obama expand abort instead make rare instead make safer make abort particularli preborn babi color district columbia record abus taxpay fund abort bad news true news district permiss abort fund polici countri abort fund anyon medicaid recipi elizabeth reveal dc budget director time confirm district govern polici fund abort demand attempt determin circumst pregnanc dc allow childrento receiv abort servic without consent parent imagin dc children receiv abort without parent consent mean american taxpay fund abort pay children minor could easili brought state rememb dc mile squar minor could transport across state line brought dc state abort paid byth american taxpay right washington dc avoid parent notif law home state that accord alan guttmach institut accord plan parenthood dont accur number abort dc due women state come dc abort problem deep problem measur that amend made sens reason unfortun obama administr take bandaid problem expos even infect infect money know money lead abort particularli abort babi color realli sad stori dont want talk sad stori life wonder stori would love even talk posit stori lifeand beauti realli ugli stori expand abort miseri women forc abort often given incomplet inadequ inform may head lifetim addict depress sens loss grief may deal year dont want happen want women dignifi dont want women brutal that even realli believ women believ women choic empow women doesnt empow women put situat theyr forc someth quit often pressur boyfriend careless parent dont want bother want thank repres jean schmidt heart love heart love issu courag digniti brought togeth group men women hous floor even believ strongli american women hurt bill certainli american children hurt bill thank courag bring forward even,696,FALSE
1110047312,"Madam Speaker. Republicans want to work with the President and our Democrat colleagues here in the Congress to make sure that every American has access to highquality. affordable health coverage. On an issue like this. we need to act. but we also need to get it right. Printed on recycled paper. H6310 COl Frankly. the record the Democrats have amassed this year so far shows us why we need to take our time. Think about it. On every major issue addressed by Congress and the White House this year. the middle class has taken a big hit. Middleclass Americans are paying for a trillion dollar ""stimulus"" package that no one read. Theyre paying for a $400 billion omnibus appropriation bill with 9.000 earmarks in it. Theyre paying to bail out those who lied on their mortgage applications. Theyre paying for a government takeover of General Motors with no exit strategy. And theyre paying for a budget that didnt include a tax cut that was promised for. yes. you guessed it. the middle class in America. And if Democrats get their way. theyll be paying for a national energy tax on anyone who has the audacity to drive a car or to flip on a light switch. Over and over again. the people who follow the rules are being left behind by Washington. Are Democrats going to leave the middle class behind on health care as well? The forthcoming plan from Democratic leaders will make health care more expensive. limit treatments. ration care. and put bureaucrats in charge of medical decisions rather than patients and doctors. That amounts to a government takeover of health care. and it will hurt. rather than help. middleclass families across our country. The administration likes to say they can expand health care andlower costs at the same time. but I think thats just simply nonsense. You cant add -millions of Americans to the government health care rolls and reduce costs unless government takes control of medical decisions. rations care. and limits treatments. all of which will reduce quality and undermine the care that Americans have come to expect. Republicans believe theres a better way. Led by RoY BLUNT. the Health Care Solutions Group is crafting a plan that will ensure access to affordable. quality health care for every American. regardless of preexisting conditions. This plan will protect Americans from being forced into a new governmentrun plan that raises taxes. rations care. and eliminates coverage for more than 100 million Americans who receive their health care coverage from their employer. It will ensure that medical decisions are made by patients and their doctors. not by government bureaucrats. We want to let Americans who like their health care coverage keep it and give all Americans the freedom to choose the plan that.best meets their needs. We want to improve Americans lives through effective prevention. wellness. and disease management programs. while developing new treatments and cures for lifethreatening diseases. I hope Democrats here in Congress and the administration will work with us to make sure that we do this right.

1110002503,I thank the gentleman for yielding. I think the ranking member said it best yesterday when there were hearings on this that there was a time in this country when the people would go to the bank and borrow money from the bank. My grandfather was a banker for a good number of years. even back in the thirties. and when a person went to the bank. the bank would require sometimes that the bank would want to know what the money was going to be spent on. of all things. and then forms would be filled out and money would be loaned. Times have changed. Now the people loan money to the bank. to many banks. to the very special interest banks. and we know not what they are doing with that money. and certainly no background checks or forms were filled out by those banks before we gave them the money.

1110048147,Mr. President. today I wish to pay tribute to and recognize the passing of a remarkable citizen from my home State of Idaho. Dr. Taylor Henry Carr. He served his country as a gunnery officer in the Navy and he served his community as a doctor and philanthropist. He was a prime example of an American father. citizen. and patriot. He was also my uncle. and I am proud to be his nephew. As a doctor. he did much for the families of Idaho Falls. and. as a philanthropist. he did much for the community itself. Idaho Falls will miss him but will continue to benefit from the efforts of all those whom he influenced. Dr. Carrs accomplishments attest to his contribution to his community and country. -He was a Boy Scout and a gunnery officer in the Navy. He was editor of his college newspaper and student body president. He earned an undergraduate degree in pharmacy and a graduate degree in medicine. Over the course of his career. he served in many_ different roles including director of the Idaho Cancer Society. president of staff at Sacred Heart Hospital. and on the Board of Directors of the ISU Alumni Association.

1110052693,"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Every day since Irans election. the streets of Tehran have been filled with demonstrators. and each day this past week the number seems to be growing: Even staterun media in Iran has put the number of demonstrators in Tehran at ""hundreds of thousands."" One British newspaper reports that there were a million demonstrators in Tehran yesterday. What do these demonstrators want? Are they simply in favor of the can-* didate Mir Hossein Mousavi? Or are they making a more profound statement about the Iranian regime? Nobody knows exactly. We do know one thing. though: The demonstrators feel their intelligence was insulted and their dignity assaulted by the highhanded manner in which the results of the June 12 election were handled. They want justice. This morning the Supreme Leader offered none. It is not for us to decide who should run Iran. much less determine the real winner of the June 12 election. but we must reaffirm our strong belief that the Iranian people have a fundamental right to express their views about the future of their country freely and without intimidation. The Iranian regime is clearly embarraised by the demonstrations and has not shrunk from using violence to stop them. At least eight demonstrators. and quite likely a number more. have been killed. and hundreds have been injured. The regime has also tried to ban media coverage of the demonstrations. Foreign journalists are consigned to their homes and offices. Several have been expelled from the country. Cell phone coverage has been frequently blocked in order to limit communication among the protesters. and the regime has interfered with the Internet and taken down many opposition Web sites. We cannot stand silent in the face of this assault on human freedom and dignity. I repeat that we have no interest in interfering in Irans internal affairs. That era has ended. This resolution affirms the ""universality of individual rights"" as well as ""the importance of democratic and fair elections."" Beyond that. it simply expresses its solidarity with ""Iranian citizens who embrace the values of freedom. human rights. civil liberties. and the rule of law."" I dont know how many of the demonstrators fall- into that category. but I do know that many of them do. This resolution also condemns the bloody suppression of freedom. It is not a judgment on who won the Iranian elections. it is an acknowledgment that we cannot remain silent when cherished universal principles are under attack. Mr. Speaker.

1110064555,Madam President. I rise today to talk about an issue of great importance to our Nations energy supply and our ability to continue producing affordable and reliable domestic energy. In particular. I would like to speak about a provision in the fiscal year 2010 Department of Interior. Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations Act conference report which pertains to a study on the use of hydraulic fracturing. an extremely important tool that will enable us to unlock the vast potential of our domestic oil and gas supplies. Hydraulic fracturing is a critical technique used in producing domestic oil and gas resources. Across the country. leaders are recognizing the growing importance of natural gas to our Nations energy supply. Natural gas is the most abundant form of clean energy in the United States. Natural gas. including gas from coal beds and other unconventional sources. is becoming an increasingly important energy source for the United States. Most experts predict that demand for natural gas is likely to increase dramatically in the next decade. The increased production of natural gas will both enhance our energy security and help us address the problem of carbon reduction. The Interior appropriations conference report includes a provision to study the relationship between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water. It is imperative that we ensure that any study conducted is based strictly on facts and science. Specifically. any study must be conducted in a comprehensive. scientific. credible and transparent manner. It must be based upon the best available science as well as independent sources of information. Additionally. it should allow for stakeholder participation and should be conducted in coordination with states and interstate regulator agencies. Finally. the study should seek input and participation from industry and be peer reviewed. This will ensure that the study is credible and useful I am confident that if properly conducted. the proposed study will clarify that the use of hydraulic fracturing will help to increase our domestic resource potential while posing no environmental harm.,111116441,HUTCHISON,KAY,S,TX,F,R,,voting,2009-10-29,777,Mrs. HUTCHISON,37537,37597,10292009.txt,2136,330,111,2009,madam presid rise today talk issu great import nation energi suppli abil continu produc afford reliabl domest energi particular would like speak provis fiscal year depart interior environ relat agenc appropri act confer report pertain studi use hydraul fractur extrem import tool enabl us unlock vast potenti domest oil ga suppli hydraul fractur critic techniqu use produc domest oil ga resourc across countri leader recogn grow import natur ga nation energi suppli natur ga abund form clean energi unit state natur ga includ ga coal bed unconvent sourc becom increasingli import energi sourc unit state expert predict demand natur ga like increas dramat next decad increas product natur ga enhanc energi secur help us address problem carbon reduct interior appropri confer report includ provis studi relationship hydraul fractur drink water imper ensur studi conduct base strictli fact scienc specif studi must conduct comprehens scientif credibl transpar manner must base upon best avail scienc well independ sourc inform addit allow stakehold particip conduct coordin state interst regul agenc final studi seek input particip industri peer review ensur studi credibl use confid properli conduct propos studi clarifi use hydraul fractur help increas domest resourc potenti pose environment harm,196,FALSE
1110014078,"Mr. President. our economy needs a stimulus. there is no question about it. Senator CARDnn certainly illustrated that in his remarks. Americans are worried. very worried about job security and how they will support their families and stay in their homes if they lose their jobs. The Senator mentioned businesses in Maryland. I know businesses in Kansas are the same way. All over the country. our Nations businesses are struggling. Not a day seems to pass without another major U.S. employer announcing stunning layoffs.. However. this conference reportthis didnt get here until 12 last night. You talk about -transparency. I defy any Senator to say he has been through every page of this in terms of transparency. This conference report is a missed opportunity. We had an opportunity to provide progrowth policies that put -money directly into the pockets of families and businesses. When they have more money in their pocket. they can spend it as they see fit rather than handing the money over to the Government to redistribute elsewhere. Instead the conference report further reduces the tax relief that will go to workers from $500 to $400 per individual. from $1.000 to $800 per couple. Estimates are that this tax relief will add about $13 more per week in the workers paycheck this year. Next year it will add only about $8 a week. How will $8 a week stimulate the economy? It wont even buy a family of four dinner at McDonalds off the dollar menu. They will probably have to split the hamburger. We also had an opportunity to fix housing firstthat is the Gordian knot of what faces us in terms of an economic stimulusto address the core problem in our economy. Unfortunately. our colleagues across the aisle rejected meaningful housing relief during Senate debate. Now the conference report dramatically cuts the tax relief to encourage qualified home buyers to purchase a home. one of the very few things in the stimulus that would have done us some good. Most Americans are clearly opposed to the spending in this bill. A bill negotiated in a backroom deal without the transparency we were promised by the new administration. A bill that increases spending at the expense of putting money directly in the pockets of families and businesses. This bill remains a honey pot for too many special interests. It reinforces a growing and dangerous mindset that the Governmentnot private enterprise. personal responsibility and hard workis the creator of wealth and prosperity. It reinforces for individuals. businesses. and State and local governments that the Federal Government is the source for funding forthe honey potfor whatever they need. I have here the ""Berenstein Bears."" a little book I read to first. second. and third graders. It should have been required reading prior to the stimulus. ""The Trouble With Money. With the Berenstein Bears."" Open the book and it reads: When little bears spend every nickel and penny. the trouble with money is they never have any. And then after learning their lesson. the cub asked Momma bear: What about the money we earned? You earned it and it is yours. said Momma. No more. not with this conference report. It borrows money for programs that. in many cases. should be funded by local or State investments and that wont create jobs now. such as $300 million for new cars for Federal employees. The problem with $300 million for new cars is that somebody is going to drive them. Rather than focusing on practical and comprehensive approaches to fixing housing first. this bill diverts Federal funds to controversial and politically skewed groups that will do nothing to address interest rates. availability of credit. or declining home values that are at the root of the housing and mortgage crisis. Two infrastructure provisions have miraculously grown during this conference. First. the Senate bill provided the highest level of funding for Amtrak at $850 million. The House had $800 million. The conference report includes $1.3 billion for the rail company. Does this mean Amtrak will stop in Dodge City. KS at some time other than 4 a.m. which they do today? Second. the high speed rail earmark that is not anearmark. that received $2 billion in the Senate bill and zero in the House. has somehow grown by 400 percent overnight. I know some of my colleagues will come up and say this is not an earmark to the tune of $8 billion in taxpayer money. But press reports have already questioned this definition since it appears the rail link between Los Angeles and Las Vegas will be the major beneficiary. I guess they hit the jackpot. I want to be clear as well that the health care provisions in this bill are not stimulative. Instead they represent major policy changes that should have gone through the regular order. The most egregious example of this stealth maneuvering is $1.1 billion for the establishment of a new Federal board to conduct comparative effectiveness research. The majority is aiming. bluntly put. for. research that justifies restricting access for Medicare patients to medical treatments that the Government deemsto be not cost effective. That is an extremely dangerous path to be on. One need look no further than Canada and the United Kingdom for examples of comparative effectiveness research being used to d6ny access for treatments for breast cancer. Alzheimeis disease. rheumatoid arthritis. and much more. I also want to highlight the inequitable increases to Federal Medicaid funding for States. I have heard arguments from my friends from States that reap large windfalls under the regular Medicaid formula as well as under the special bonus formula in this bill. But you cannot tell me with a straight face that the State of New York deserves $12.2 billion more than the State of Kansas. Under this bill. the State of Kansas is estimated to receive an additional $450 million. while the State of New York will receive an additional $12.65 billion. That is nearly 28 times more than what my State will receive. When CBO estimates that total enrollmentdriven State Medicaid increases are only expected to be $10.8 billion. well anything more than that is an earmark in my book. So I want everyone to understand the State of New York is getting an earmark that is 28 times what the State of Kansas is getting. 23 times what the State of Iowa is getting. and 41 times what the State of Nebraska is getting. That is not fair. Americans do not want us to place greater debt on future generations by .supporting a bill that doesnt provide the right incentives to stimulate the economy and create private sector jobs. The American public does not want the Government determining what is and what is not a beneficial health care treatment. This is not our finest hour as a Congress. We had a real opportunity- to stimulate our economy. create jobs. and put money back in families wallets through common sense tax relief. There is an old story that says you cant kill a frog by dropping him in boiling water. He reacts so quickly to the sudden heat that he jumps out before he is hurt.

1110031457,Mr. Speaker. I would just like to respond briefly to some of the mischaracterizations that have been raised about this legislation. As I stated earlier. the Crane Conservation Act is identical to noncontroversial legislation that passed the House during the 10th Congress. This legislation also mirrors other highly popular and effective wildlife conservation funds authorized under the Multinational Species Conservation Fund that support other critically endangered wildlife species and their habitats. It is no exaggeration to say that the grants awarded through these funds have been pivotal in the recovery of some of the most endangered wildlife populations on the planet. Cranes are no less deserving. I think that it is also important to note that grants awarded through these funds generate nonFederal matching contributions commonly in excess of three or four times the amount of the Federal grant. As a result. these wildlife programs are some of our most effective conservation programs in leveraging additional funds from partner organizations. Mr. Speaker. it is expected that future grants awarded from a crane conservation fund will provide the same kind of leveraging benefit as demonstrated by the other funds authorized under the Multinational Species Conservation Fund. The track record for these programs has proven that they are not only good for wildlife conservation. they are also a great value to the Federal taxpayer. Again. I ask Members on both sides to support passage of this noncontroversial bill. Mr. Speaker.

1110052950,"Madam Speaker. the State of Texas lost a warrior this month in the Forward Operating Base Gardez in Afghanistan. a remote and desolate place in the middle of the badlands in this war zone. Army Specialist Jarrett Griemel died on Wednesday. June 9. 2009. from injuries he suffered in Afghanistan. He was just 20 years of age. This is a photograph right here. Madam Speaker. of Specialist Griemel. Specialist Griemel is the 28th warrior to have died in Iraq or Afghanistan with connections to my Second Congressional Districtin Texas. Jarrett was a young man who personified the best qualities of the young people in America today. Born in San Angelo. Texas. and raised in La Porte. Texas. Jarrett was living the life he had. always made plans to live. that being a life filled with the achievement and adventure that he desired. Jarrett was a patriot. He joined the Army his junior year in high school. and he had already. completed basic training before graduating with honors from La Porte High School. He was a member of the swim team and the surf club. and he loved the outdoors and especially the beach and water sports. Jarrett spent his spare time parachuting and cliff diving. Jarrett lived his lifeto the fullest. In February of last year. Jarrett married his high school sweetheart. Candice. at a small ceremony in front of a justice of the peace. She joined him in Alaska. where he was deployed by the Army. to begin their young married lives together. Jarrett had a lifetime goal of eventually becominga surgeon. Jarrett was an athletic young man with bright red hair and an infectious smile. His brother Chase says he and Jareett were typical adventurous boys growing up. They spent time in the woods catching snakes and bugs. He wanted to travel. see the world and live a life of excitement and adventure. An& Jarrettdid just that. Jarrett was a petroleum supply specialist assigned to the 425th Brigade Special Troops Battalion. 4th Brigade combat Team (Airborne) of the 25th Infantry Division Battalion at Fort Richardson Alaska. home of the Arctic Warriors. The 3.500soldier brigade is still in the midst of deploying in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. Madam Speaker. our American warriors live under the most grueling of conditions in Afghanistan. Jarretts experience in the outdoors growing up would come in handy in the rugged and cursed terrain. Having been to Afghanistan myself. I have witnessed how the hot desert sun is unrelenting as our soldiers patrol the dusty. rocky mountains and deserts.

1110066316,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank my good friend. the gentleman from Florida for introducing this important resolution that recognizes the historic events in Czechoslovakia in 1989 and enables Congress to reaffirm its strong friendship and support for the people of the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic. Twenty years ago. on November 17. communist riot police broke up a peaceful prodemocracy demonstration in Prague. brutally beating many of the student protesters. Rather than silencing the students. however. these violent reprisals led to an avalanche of protests between November 17 and December 29 that ultimately led to the fall of the Communist Party in Czechoslovakia. In the days after the initial protest. a prohuman rights group. known as Charter 77. united with other groups to become the Civic Forum. a strong voice calling for reform. civil liberties. and rights for all citizens. Led by dissent playwright Vaclav Havel. the Civic Forum succeeded in forcing the communist government to resign. paving the way for Havels election on December 29 as the President of Czechoslovakia. Known around the world as the Velvet Revolution. these historic events further cemented the collapse of the communist regimes throughout Central and Eastern Europe. and helped to precipitate the end of the Cold War. In June 1990. Czechoslovakia held its first democratic election since 1946. bringing into power its first completely noncommunist government in over 40 years. In the 20 years since these momentous events. the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic have become strong. vibrant democracies. close NATO allies. and staunch friends of the United States. They continue to contribute to international peace efforts. including by providing troops and assistance under NATO command in Afghanistan. Millions of Americans trace their roots to these two great nations. and the United States is strengthened by their rich cultural heritage and their many significant achievements and contributions. Mr. Speaker. this resolution acknowledges and commemorates the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia 20 years ago this month. It also reaffirms the bonds of friendship and cooperation between the United States and the Czech Republic. I urge all of our colleagues to support this important resolution. Mr. Speaker.

1110031335,Mr. President. I would -like to add my voice in support of the nominee. Chris Hill. whom I have had the pleasure of working with extensively in his current assignment. both in my role as a member of the Armed Services Committee and also of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I think he is a uniquely qualified individual. He has a long history of success. If anything. in the current debate. I believe he is perhaps being victimized by the fact that he is a loyal diplomat and was carrying out. with great expertise. the charges that had been given to him as someone who has a career in that area. The numbers are pretty clear. He is going to get at least 70 votes. I believe it is time for us to end this debate and have the vote and get Chris Hill on his way. I respect the Senator from Kansas. I respect his concerns. He has been a great champion in terms of human rights. I would just suggest that this is not the place to continue this sort of discussion when the situation in Iraq is filled with unknowns. as it is. and our need of getting someone who has these types of qualifications over there to do this job.

1110028979,Mr. Speaker. we have put in this bill that the FDA has the power to lower the levels of nicotine to a level that would be appropriate for the protection of the public health.

I would not like to see people smoking cigarettes at all. but Im not for prohibition. and therefore. we did not give the FDA that power to ban cigarettes in effect. Now. its odd to find that were criticized for not doing enough and then are criticized for doing too much. You cant have it both ways. I think the FDA is in the position to regulate.

1110054945,Mr. President. I rise today to applaud the Senates passage of a resolution I submitted earlier this week with the cochair of the Senate Boating Caucus. Senator BURR. Our resolution recognizes July 1. as National Boating Day. and more importantly. recognizes the importance of boating and fishing to our economy and our constituents. I believe this resolution comes at a critical time. Like so many other industries. the boating industry has suffered during these tough economic times. Last summers high gas prices and this past years credit crisis has put many manufacturers and their dealers at risk. And that endangers the hundreds of thousands of wellpaying jobs that the boating industry provides. Wisconsin is a microcosm of boating and fishing in America. With access to the Great Lakes and thousands of acres of internal lakes and rivers. Wisconsin is home to more than 1.4 million anglers and a destination for both boating and fishing related -tourists. .Beyond the tourism jobs generated by recreational boating. the boating industry has a strong foothold in my State. Whether its. Mercury Marine in Fond du Lac to SkipperLiner in La Crosse. boating manufacturers. suppliers. dealers and marinas account for thousands of jobs. In 2001. approximately $1 billion was spent in the State on fishing related activities. according to a study conducted by the Fish and Wildlife Service. Recreational boating is an equal partner to the sport fishing industry. with more than $526 million being spent in 2003 on powerboats and accessories. The importance of boating. however. extends well beyond its economic impact. More than 59 million people spend time each year on our rivers. lakes. and coastlines. These are families spending time together and they are people learning more about the natural resources our country has to offer. The true impact of boating is immeasurable. And that is why I am so pleased to join my colleagues in supporting the resolution passed earlier today. I hope that on July 1National Boating Dayboth Members of. Congress and the American people will reflect on the true importance of boating to our country.,111116451,KOHL,HERBERT,S,WI,M,D,,voting,2009-06-25,270,Mr. KOHL,21440,21501,06252009.txt,2137,346,111,2009,mr presid rise today applaud senat passag resolut submit earlier week cochair senat boat caucu senat burr resolut recogn juli nation boat day importantli recogn import boat fish economi constitu believ resolut come critic time like mani industri boat industri suffer tough econom time last summer high ga price past year credit crisi put mani manufactur dealer risk endang hundr thousand wellpay job boat industri provid wisconsin microcosm boat fish america access great lake thousand acr intern lake river wisconsin home million angler destin boat fish relat tourist beyond tourism job gener recreat boat boat industri strong foothold state whether mercuri marin fond du lac la cross boat manufactur supplier dealer marina account thousand job approxim billion spent state fish relat activ accord studi conduct fish wildlif servic recreat boat equal partner sport fish industri million spent accessori import boat howev extend well beyond econom impact million peopl spend time year river lake coastlin famili spend time togeth peopl learn natur resourc countri offer true impact boat immeasur pleas join colleagu support resolut pass earlier today hope juli nation boat member congress american peopl reflect true import boat countri,192,FALSE
1110011572,Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding. As the gentleman from Kentucky knows. I was racing over here as my colleague from Oklahoma was extolling our Heisman Trophy winner Sam Bradford. I was caught on the barbers chair as this momentous event began. and so the gentleman has been kind enough tos allow me to address some of my remarks toward Mr. Bradfords achievement. I want to begin by thanking my good friend. the gentlelady from Oklahoma. Mary Fallin. for bringing the resolution to the floor honoring Sam Bradford and his remarkable achievements. He was born in my colleagues district. but his distinction was really earned in mine because he plays at .the University of Oklahoma. and were extraordinarilyproud of him as a player. as any college would be. He frankly has won two Big 12 titles in his 2 years. Hes had the opportunity to play for a national championship. We came up a little -bit short in that game. and we congratulate our friends at the University of Florida who played a great game with a great quarterback. Mr. Tebow. but we look forward to having the opportunity to meet them or somebody else somewhere down the road. Were proud of everything hes done. Hes led the country in passing. Hes one of the most accurate throwers. led the country in touchdown passes. You could literally list the achievements at great length. but frankly. were proud of him as a student. In a day when a lot of athletes are there simply to play football or basketball or track or whatever their sport is. Sam Bradford is a 3.95 major in finance at the University of Oklahoma. So hes pretty serious about his academic life. Were proud of him as a person. Frankly. hes active in the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. He is active in Read Across America. Obviously. were very proud of his native heritage as a member of the Cherokee Nation. And thats important to -us in Oklahoma. certainly important to me as a member of the- Chickasaw Nation. to see the kind of role niodel he is. not only for Cherokees but. frankly. for young men and women all across Indian country. regardless of tribal affiliation. I think were probably most proud of him. Mr. Speaker. for the manner in which he leads. He is a quiet leader. Hes not a shouter. Hes not somebody that is theatrical on the field. You dont see him engaging in taunting for the type of celebration that frankly glorifies the individual at the expense of the team. You see him lead by example. And all of his fellow players comment on this repeatedly. that in the huddle. hes quiet. hes professional. hes businesslike. hes quick to give the credit to the people that he plays with. and. frankly. hes quick to give the credit to his opponents who he regards with respect and as worthy ad.versaries and people who bring their own traits of hard work and character to the field. The relationship that he had with not only Mr. Tebow but also with our rivals in the south. Colton McCoy of the University of Texas. is the kind of relationship you like to see on the football field. and frankly probably something all of us in this Chamber could take a lesson from. I doubt there is any fiercer rivalry in college football than there is between the University of Texas and the University of Oklahoma. And I also doubt that there are any two schools that are prouder of their two quarterbacks. and H.1052 I also doubt there are any two quarterbacks that respect one anothers talents more and are quick to praise the others achievements not only over the course of the season but in the contest in which theyre in. So we are extraordinarily proud. obviously. of Sam Bradford. Mr. Speaker. because hes led us to victory on the athletic field. because hes been a student. because. frankly. hes engaged in activities beyond being an athlete and beyond being a student to help others and to help his community. because of his Native American heritage. But most of all. simply because of the kind of person that he is. Hes a role model not just in athletics and not just from my State but. frankly. hes the kind of person that all of us should aspire to be. And hes wise beyond his years. and he conducts himself in a manner well beyond his years. With that. again. I thank my colleague. Ms. FALLIN from the State of Oklahoma. for bringing this resolution.

1110028431,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Today. I am pleased to bring to the floor H.R. 1804. the Federal Retirement Reform Act of 2009. The bill modernizes the Thrift Savings Plan. the retirement savings plan for Federal employees. The legislation includes several other important retirement reforms for Federal employees and members of the Armed Forces. This bill enjoyed strong bipartisan support in the last Congress when it passed the House as H.R. 1108. Two weeks ago. the Oversight and Government Reform Committee again considered and reported favorably the current language of this bill. I am pleased that the bill makes further progress in ending the military family tax which unfairly penalizes the survivors of those who died in service or as a result of their serviceconnected injuries. As Chairman SKELTON will explain. this bill increases the monthly amounts paid to surviving spouses who are denied the full amount of their annuity under the Survivor Benefit Plan. Our enhancement to the TSP program also will benefit military members and their families. The Federal Employee Thrift Savings Plan is one of the best retirement savings programs in the Nation. The plan runs with very low cost and is a model for both the private sector and other governments. The bill we are considering today will strengthen and modernize the TSP. At the suggestion of the Federal Retirement T1hrift Investment Board. the bill provides for automatic enrollment in TSP for new Federal civilian employees. Employees have the opportunity to choose whether to enroll or not. but for those who do not make any decision enrollment would be the default. The decision on automatic enrollment for members of the uniformed services is at the discretion of the Secretaries of the military departments. The bill would also provide a Roth contribution option for TSP. With a Roth option. employee contributions are made after taxes are deducted. and. the employee does not pay taxes on the fund upon withdrawal. This option is currently available in many private sector retirement plans today. The bill also includes a provision to allow employees covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System to receive credit for unused sick leave towards their retirement annuity. as is currently the case for employees covered by the older Civil Service Retirement System. The comfnittee also adopted amendments to make it easier for former employees to reinstate their retirement credits if they return to Federal service. and to work parttime at the end of their career. I want to recognize the Federal Workforce Subcommittee chairman.,111117170,TOWNS,EDOLPHUS,H,NY,M,D,10,voting,2009-04-01,766,Mr. TOWNS,35554,35630,04012009.txt,2629,424,111,2009,mr speaker yield time may consum today pleas bring floor hr feder retir reform act bill modern thrift save plan retir save plan feder employe legisl includ sever import retir reform feder employe member arm forc bill enjoy strong bipartisan support last congress pass hous hr two week ago oversight govern reform committe consid report favor current languag bill pleas bill make progress end militari famili tax unfairli penal survivor die servic result serviceconnect injuri chairman skelton explain bill increas monthli amount paid surviv spous deni full amount annuiti survivor benefit plan enhanc tsp program also benefit militari member famili feder employe thrift save plan one best retir save program nation plan run low cost model privat sector govern bill consid today strengthen modern tsp suggest feder retir thrift invest board bill provid automat enrol tsp new feder civilian employe employe opportun choos whether enrol make decis enrol would default decis automat enrol member uniform servic discret secretari militari depart bill would also provid roth contribut option tsp roth option employe contribut made tax deduct employe pay tax fund upon withdraw option current avail mani privat sector retir plan today bill also includ provis allow employe cover feder employe retir system receiv credit unus sick leav toward retir annuiti current case employe cover older civil servic retir system also adopt amend make easier former employe reinstat retir credit return feder servic work parttim end career want recogn feder workforc subcommitte chairman,242,FALSE
1110049212,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time. as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. the Republican substitute. as I *as saying. also fully funds- the administrations request for the critically important new Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund. PCCF. Forging an effective partnership with Pakistans military and intelligence apparatus has not been a straightforward affair. Although the United States has enjoyed some success. our efforts have also been hampered by a series of exceptionally difficult problems. One is a matter of a threat. perception and divergent strategic priorities. with Pakistan almost obsessively focused on their traditional rival in India. Another problem is the legacy of mistrust on both sides. a trust- deficit. as I discussed earlier. that continues to greatly complicate our bilateral relations. A third problem is a limited Pakistani ability to conduct modern counterinsurgency. and to some degree counterterrorism operations. against al Qaeda and their allies in the tribal areas. There is no question. for example. that Pakistan needs to fully cooperate with New Delhi in holding accountable all of .those responsible for the brutal assault in Mumbai as well as work with the U.S. and others on critical nonproliferation concerns. We do not disagree with the overarching goals and the strategic priorities that we want to achieve in relation to Pakistan. Our disagreement is that at this juncture we believe that the best way to achieve critical interests is to give the administration the scope to develop intensive. multiple approaches to rebuild. to strengthen relationships with Pakistan. and address. threats common to both of our nations. We believe the Republican substitute is a more workable basis than the underlying bill for being a partner with Pakistan at thiscritical time. The substitute heeds the concerns raised by Secretary Gates and the Joint Chiefs Chairman. Admiral Mullen. who wrote about this underlying bill. The Department is concerned about aspects of this bill. in particular. those provisions that impose conditions on the furnishing of military assistance that may undermine current administration authorities such as the Global Train and Equip authority. And furthermore. this will allow the Department to use the funds expeditiously and effectively without these purse strings. as evolving circumstance may warrant. in an effort to implement the Presidents strategy for the region most effeGtively. And I think that this Republican substitute gets to what the Department of Defense wishes to do. what the Obama administration wants to achieve. what our democratic allies in Pakistan and here. our strong military in the U.S.. wants to achieve. a robust.- free and democratic Pakistan upon which we can build that level of trust again.

1110007660,Mr. President. I could not agree more with my colleague from Rhode Island. There are a lot of things we need in this country right now. We need jobs. We need something to stimulate our economy. We need certainty in the credit market. But probably more than anything what we need in this country right now is confidence. confidence that we can face down these problems and move forward like America has always done. What do we have instead of confidence? Raw anger. I am mad. Everyone I work for is mad. Anger can be constructive. It canbe channeling. I am here today to say it is time we channel this anger and change the law. We do not need anger. We have a bunch of idiots on Wall Street who are kicking sand in the face of the American taxpayer. My colleague talked about some of them. Let me review. These financial institutions. on the brink of extinction. come to the American taxpayer for hundreds of billions of dollars at the very same time they think they are going to buy a $50 million corporate jet. They are going to pay out $18 billion in bonuses. They paid an average of $2.6 million to every executive at the first 116 banks that got taxpayer money under TARP. Let me say that again: An average of $2.6 million in executive pay to the folks at the first 116 banks that got money from the taxpayers. They dont get it. These people are idiots. You cant use taxpayer money to pay out $18 billion in bonuses. Merrill Lynch is unbelievable. They saved $3 billion to $4 billion from the pot of money that was going to Bank of America. the sale that was going to close the first week in January. They always gave bonuses in January. Do you know what these sneaky guys did? They decided to give their bonuses in December before the Bank of America took over. They paid out $3 billion to $4 billion in bonuses in December. and that quarter. Merrill Lynch lost $21 billion. What planet are these people on? What could they be thinking about? So here is what this bill is going to do. This is called the Cap Executive Officer Pay Act of 2009. and it is very simple. Going forward. you want taxpayers to help you survive? You want the people at your financial institution to have a job tomorrow? Then you are going to have to limit everyones pay at your company to the same salary the President of the United States makes. Is that so unreasonable? It is eight times the median household income in the United States of America$400.000 a year. I dont think that sounds like a bad deal. Should these people be making more than the President of the United States? Now. really. should they? They should not be making more than the President of the United States. So every executive going forward could not make more than $400.000 a year. and they have to limi t that executive compensation for everyone in their company until they pay back every dime to the taxpayers. Now. once they are off the public dole. once the taxpayers arent footing the bill. then it is not as much our business what they get paid. But right now. they are on the hook to us. and they owe us something other than a fancy wastebasket and a $50 million jet. They owe us some common sense. If any of them think it is a hardship to take the salary of the President of the United States. I dare them to say so out loud right now because that is not going to instill confidence. What is going to instill confidence is for the men and women in these companies to realize it is time for everyone in this country to tighten their belt. It is time for everyone to realize we must have our financial institutions survive but not with a culture that thinks it is OK to kick the taxpayer in the shins while they drink champagne and fly in fancy jets. It doesnt work. not in the United States of America. I ask my colleagues to sign on to this bill. I think it makes sense. We should have done it in the first place. but I dont think any of us thought these guys were this stupid. I dont think any of us believed they would take billions of dollars of bonuses while their institutions were literally days from being wiped out. but they did. and we have learned our lesson. So I hope all my colleagues will sign on this bill. I hope we can get it passed quickly so that from this day forward. the President of the United States will make the same amount of money as the executives of these companies who owe the taxpayers hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars.

1110064400,"Mr. President. these days. the economy is foremost on the minds of Americans. and well it should be. Two out of five Americans say the economy should be our top priority. That is more than twice as many as cite any other issuetwo times that the economy is much more important. The unemployment insurance bill before us today helps to address the economy in several ways. In several ways. our legislation would help Americans to get and keep good jobs. First. our bill would extend much needed unemployment benefits. This unemployment insurance relief would get money into the hands of people who need itneed it desperately. I might say. there are about 15 million Americans out of work chasing about 3 million jobs. There are many more people unemployed looking for work. When we help unemployed Americans. lets also remember we help our communities. not just the individuals who receive unemployment benefitsand they have earned those benefitsbut also the communities are helped by payment of those benefits. When we help our unemployed neighbors. we also help to keep open the neighborhood grocery store and the neighborhood gas station. When we help our unemployed neighbors. we also help to keep houses out of foreclosure. When we help our unemployed neighbors. we also help our economy. we help ourselves. According to officials in my home State of Montana. if we do not pass this 14week extension. then at least 7.000 Montanans will lose their unemployment benefits. That is a significant number when we consider the population of my State. which is just a little bit over 900.000 total. A report prepared in June for the Montana Manufacturing Center showed that nationwide manufacturing employment fell from 13.8 million workers at the end of 2007 to 12.4 million workers at the beginning of 2009. That is a 10.5percent drop in little more than a yeara 10.5percent drop in workers in just more than a year. The decline nationwide was echoed in Montana. where manufacturing employment fell 8 percent. In south central Montana. logging and milling have slowed down in the Bozeman area. just as they have elsewhere in the State. That means workers in the logging and milling industries have been losing their jobs. It is absolutely essential we get this aid to those in need so they can continue to put food on the table while they continue to look for work. A second integral part of this legislative package is the extension of the home buyers tax credit. This tax credit has already helped nearly 1.5 million Americans to achieve the dream of owning a home. Without this tax credit. many of these firsttime home buyers would have remained on the sidelines. They would have been unable to buy a home in these challenging economic times. The home buyers tax credit provides up to $8.000 for millions of Americans to purchase their first home. The credit has helped to reduce the excess supply of homes on the market and. in doing so. the credit has helped to stabilize the housing market. In many places throughout the country. homes are selling and inventories are dropping. The Pending Home Sales Index. a leading indicator of existing home sales. rose again in September for the eighth straight month. Total housing inventory fell 10.8 percent at the end of August. Home prices also appear to be slowly recovering. The CaseShiller Home Price Index increased 1.4 percent in June after falling for 35 consecutive months. These encouraging numbers tell us that the home buyer tax credit is working. Yet the housing market remains fragile. High unemployment has increased foreclosure rates. inventories remain well above normal levels. and homes are worth substantially less than they were a year ago. In May. back home in Montana. I helped with a charity raffle of a new home in Billings. During the event. the homebuilders for this home told me how well the home buyer tax credit is working. They said it definitely helped to boost their sales. The builder made it very clear how much the tax credit has helped in Montana. Realtors and home builders across Montana have provided examples of the tax credit working to get buyers off the fence and into new homes. The Billings Gazette recently reported on one development where 30 homes were sold this year. Home buyers of 17 of those homes used the firsttime home buyer tax credit when they bought their home. In Bozeman. MT. housing starts and home purchases have dropped off. but it is clear that the home buyer tax credit has helped to cushion that. The success of the American economy is closely tied to the success of the housing market. By helping to stabilize the housing market. the home buyer tax credit has helped to shore up the economy as it begins to recover. It is important that we temporarily extend the home buyer tax credit to further support our recovery. That is why we have proposed extending the tax credit to April 30 of next year. Because the housing market remains fragile. we propose expanding the credit to include a greater number of potential home buyers. As before. the $8.000 tax credit would be available to those buying a principal residence for the first time. but it will also be available to home buyers who have lived in their current residence for 5 years or more. These home buyers hoping to move up would be eligible for a $6.500 tax credit. This strikes a fair middle ground. We would help firsttime home buyers and we would also help homeowners looking to move up to a new home. but we would exclude from the credit speculators who may have recently purchased a home intending to flip it for a fast profit. Our amendment would also increase income limits. This would enable an even greater number of potential home buyers to take the credit. Those earning less than $225.000 for joint filers and $125.000 for single filers would be eligible. Increasing this threshold would further stimulate the housing market by bringing a new group of buyers into the market. These days. millions of renters earn more than $75.000 a year. Our new home buyers tax credit would also include a ""binding contract"" provision that would allow anyone who has entered into a binding contract to be eligible for the credit. so long as they close on the home within 60 days. Also. the extended tax credit would continue to allow military personnel to claim their credit for an additional year. Many more Americans stand to gain from the extension of the home buyers tax credit. and with our amendment they would get help buying a new home during these tough economic times. Homes that are worth more than $800.000 would not be eligible for the home buyers tax credit. We need to target the credit toward those potential home buyers who need it most. not those buyers who would have bought a new home even without the new credit. To address concerns such as those raised by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. we have given the IRS additional tools to prevent erroneous credits from being paid. It is important that this tax credit does not become a permanent fixture in the Tax Code. That is very important. It certainly is to me. Our amendment would end the credit on April 30 of next year. This extension would get us through the winter. traditionally the worst season for real estate. Our amendment would jumpstart the housing market as it enters the summer months in 2010. With the new ""binding contract"" provision. we would effectively extend this tax credit for 7 months. long enough to encourage home buyers to buy homes but short enough to remain fiscally responsible. It is a fair approach and it would play an important role in getting the housing market back on its feet. In addition to unemployment insurance and the home buyer credit. our amendment would also add needed net operating loss relief for businesses. Under current law. corporations may carry back net operating losses 2 years. In the stimulus bill earlier this year. we were able to increase that carryback period to 5 years. but only for small businesses. The carryback provision for small businesses has been a great help to struggling small companies. They were able to carry back their losses to profitable years. and then they could file quick refund claims. This gave them much needed cash to meet payroll. invest in new equipment or inventory. or pay for other current expense obligations. But many businesses did not qualify for the carryback stimulus provision that helped small businesses. Many larger companies are also hurting during this economic downturn. Senator SNOWE and I recognized this during our discussions on the stimulus bill. We introduced a bill to expand the needed relief to all businesses. and now we are including that relief here. The great recession. which I heard to date is officially over because now the GDP is growing for the first time in I dont know how many monthsbut the great recession has hurt Montana businesses from farming to retail to manufacturing. A recent series in the Billings Gazette highlights a number of historically profitable Montana industries that are facing serious losses as a result of hard economic times. The lumber industry provides an acute example. Pyramid Mountain Lumber is the oldest surviving familyowned and familyoperated mill in Montana. Loren Rose. the controller of Pyramid Mountain. reports that their mill has faced increased costs on logs and fuel and orders have dropped because of the slowdown in home building. The owners have invested everything they have in the mill. They are terrific operators. I spent a good bit of time at that mill and I am very proud of it. They have done a super job. Loren said the lumber mills are ""all in"" as far as ownership investment. They have nothing left to invest. Other mill owners have had to shut down. Loren said that an NOL provision such as that in our bill would ""absolutely"" help in ""providing working capital to the small. independent mills."" That is his quote. Our NOL provision would directly help this industry and others in Montana that are struggling to survive in these tough economic times. Lets expand the help we provided to small businesses to all businesses. that is. all businesses that need the cash infusion now. The questions always arise: How do we pay for these provisions? Our amendment pays for them responsibly. In 2004. Congress created a new way for Americanbased corporations to allocate interest for purposes of computing their taxes. The implementation of that allocation method was to be effective in tax years beginning after 2010. Our amendment delays the effective date of that provision until tax years beginning after 2017. Our amendment also increases penalties for taxpayers who fail to timely file partnership and Scorporation returns. These two provisions would allow Congress to provide additional incentives for home buyers and implement expanded NOL carryback relief for businesses. Both of these goals are big steps toward boosting our economy. Our amendment. I believe. is the right approach. I urge my colleagues to support it. Let us respond to the concern that is foremost on Americans minds. and that is jobs. that is the economy.

1110001118,"Madam Speaker. I appreciate the widespread concern for the crisis unfolding in Gaza since December 27. The recent conflict in between Palestinians and Israelis is as tragic as it was predictable. The fundamental lesson in the Middle East is clear: without political processes that strive continuously for peace. events and the acts of extremists can overpower the desire of people across the region to reject violence. I voted ""present"" because words matter and this resolution did not express adequately the scope of the humanitarian crisis. To that end I am joining other colleagues in urging the administration to work to meet the immediate humanitarian needs while we work for a ceasefire. Any country facing such attacks would wish to respond firmly and decisively. yet it is frustrating to witness the region locked into a downward spiral of conflict. This path will give neither side what it wants. but will continue to destabilize the situation and further impede efforts at a resolution. This cycle of violence must be broken. Yet. neariy a decade of failed Bush policies has left America in a weakened position at the table. less able to help deliver peace or improve the humanitarian situation on the ground. At least the administration declined to vote against a January 8 United Nations Security Council resolutioln calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Forceful U.S. diplomatic reengagement now is critical. Though a secure Israel and an independent Palestinian state living side by side seems remote today. I have high hopes that the new Obama administration will exhibit a strong reversal of course and reengage the re.gion. Our efforts here today are inadequate to this task. We must not only work for a ceasefire that halts this backslide into chaos. but move forward toward an ultimate solution that recognizes the legitimate needs of both Israelis and Palestinians.

1110048307,"Mr. Chairman. I would like to take our time in opposition to this bill. And. Mr. Chairman. some Dear Colleague letters sent out by a few Members earlier this week. Mr. Chairman. in order to express their support for this bill. tended to focus on the few attractive features of the bill. such as the improvements that it would make on the Merida Initiative. our vital effort "" to assist Mexico and other Central American countries to fight the dangerous drug cartels. Unfortunately. supporters of this bill have remained silent or ignored its fundamental problems. And the fundamental problems on this bill are that the bill calls for exorbitant spending in the absence of true reform. and that the bill does not take the difficult but necessary step of setting priorities. either with outofcontrol spending or with important international issues that are facing our country. By our best estimate. the bill before us represents an estimated 12 percent increase in planned expenditures above the levels of fiscal year 2009. It creates 20 new government entities. offices. foundations. programs and the like.These new programs. and these new initiatives that are funded in this bill constitute expenditures that go beyond even this 12 percent increase to accounts previously funded in fiscal year The bill also represents. a 35 percent increase in State Department main salary and operating accounts. We have to ask ourselves. where is the money coming from to support the additional funding? In the coming fiscal year alone. Mr. Chairman. fiscal year 2010. we are expected to have to pay almost $285 billion. thats billion with a B. in interest costs. just interest. not payment on the debt itself. By fiscal year 2014. our cost for interest on the debt will likely have risen to about $560 billion. again. thats with a B. in that year alone. again. for interest payments alone. not for the debt payments that will have to be made. Our deficit in the coming fiscal year. 2010. is now projected to total an estimated $1.3 trillion. Yet the funding levels proposed by this bill seem -oddly detached from the reality that our families are facing today and that our Nation is facing. Both in committee markup and at the Rules Committee. I offered amendments that would have capped increases .for next year at 3.7 percent. a 2008 annual rate of inflation. This amendment would have saved taxpayer dollars. more than $2.8 billion in authorized funds. That amendment. again. would have saved American taxpayers more than $2.8 billion. with a B. in authorized funds. Unfortunately. this measured. calibrated approach was rejected twice in favor of the largesse in this spending bill. In trying to justify the enormous spending increases in this bill. supporters paint a picture of a hollowedout shell of a State Department suffering from years of neglect. Yet. according to the Congressional Research Service and the State Departments own data. funding for the State Department and related agencies doubled from fiscal year 2000 through 2008. This clearly shows that growing the bureaucracy and throwing money at the Department of State are not the answer. Supporters of this bill further argue that the major funding increases for the hiring of new staff are necessary. even in the absence of reforms. I note that there was an effort last Congress by colleagues in the other Chamber to ascertain the levels of absenteeism at various U.S. Government agencies. The results for the State Department were impressivein an ironic way. The Department explained that it did not specifi6ally track absences without official leave. It was the only executiv e branch agency that could not provide such information. Instead. the State Department only tracks those incidents in which such absenteeism reaches such an egregious level that discipline is required. As a result. weand the management of the Departmenthave little idea if the Departments own personnel are at their posts at the times we would expect them to be. And although we realize the overwhelming majority of State Department employees are hardworking patriots. they are the ones who should be upset about absenteeism in others. The bill before us today does not address such questions. nor does it build on earlier inquiries such as the ones I have cited. Instead. supporters of this bill focus their arguments on unfilled State Department vacancies. And these arguments. too. Mr. Chairman. do not bare careful scrutiny. Most of the socalled ""vacancies"" are the result of shifting personnel to highpriority posts rather than cuts in funding. Furthermore. the State Department always shows unfilled positions on their books because those numbers are the result of our overseas posts selfidentified needs rather than being a budgetdriven number. It is*a way of saying that they would like more employees and more funding. What agency wouldnt? I expect that all Americans would identify very significant unfunded needs in our own homes and our families and our budgets. Moreover. at a time when we need to cut the deficit. in just one littlenoticed instance. this bill bypasses an opportunity to transfer several hundred million dollars to our Treasury to help us pay down our national debt.

1110071286,Mr. President. we had indicated to Senators REID and DURBIN that we wanted to see if there was a way to develop some path forward on the health care bill. and I wish to at this point propound a consent agreement that might well give us a way to move forward on some of the amendments that have been pending for quite some time. some of which are both supported and opposed on each side.

1110070901,I would say to the Senator from Arizona. I went through bankruptcy reform with Senator GRASSLEY and a similar process was followed when the Republicans were in the majority. He produced the baseline bill. and I made some modifications and. ultimately. at one point in time. we agreed on a bill. came up with a common bill. The starting point is just that. a starting point. But I say to the Senator from Arizona. look at what happened to the issue of public option. I believe in public option passionately. I believe it is essential for the future of health care reform. for competition for private health insurance companies to give consumers a choice. to make sure we have one lowcost alternative at least in every market. Yet. at the end of the day. I did not get what I wanted and what is being proposed. now at the Congressional Budget Office. is not my version of public option. We ended up bending toward some of the more moderate and conservative members of the Democratic caucus and toward the Republican point of view. I dont know of a single Republican who came out for public option. Maybe I am forgetting one. At the end of the day. the point I am making to the Senator is there was an effort at flexibility and an effort at change to try to find some common ground.

1110053776,Mr. President. today I join my colleague Senator TESTER in recognizing and paying tribute to MG Thomas F. Deppe. Vice Commander of Air Force Space Command. and his wife Eileen for their lifetime of service and unfaltering dedication to the U.S. Air Force and our great Nation. As both an airman and leader. spanning 42 years of military service. General Deppes contributions to our Nations strategic deterrence and space missions were critical to the warfighter. global economy and safety of our families. General Deppes leadership was an essential element in winning the Cold War and vital to Air Force Space Commands support of combat operations around the world to include Operations Enduring Freedom. Iraqi Freedom. the global war on terrorism and overseas contingency operations. General Deppe began his illustrious Air Force career by graduating from Basic Military Training School in 1967. In September of 1967. General Deppe was introduced to the Air Force through missile instrumentation electronics technical training. This training led to a series of aircraft munitions assignments and rounded out his enlisted service with an Air Force recruiting position. achieving the enlisted rank of technical sergeant. In 1977. General Deppe received his commission through the Officer Training School. This led him to his first assign-. ment in Montana at Malmstrom Air Force Base. General Deppes Air Force journey as an officer would take Eileen and him through a series of wing. air staff and joint assignments relating to strategic and tactical missile and space systems. He operated the groundlaunched cruise missile in Europe and later -served as the commander of the 351st Organizational Missile Maintenance Squadron in Missouri at Whiteman Air Force Base. Additionally. he commanded the 90th Logistics Group at Francis E. Warren Air Force Base. WY. and the 341st Space Wing in Montana.

1110041552,"I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for yielding. Madam . Speaker. Aristotle once wrote that ""teachers are to be given the highest honor because they teach us how to live well."" and of course. thats a correct statement. Today. I am proud to rise in support of Americas teachers and pleased to be a cosponsor of H. Res. 374. This measure recognizes thesignificant roles and contributions that Americas teachers have made. to building and enhancing our country. The United States Census Bureau repoits that today there are more than 6 million schoolteachers throughout the United States. not counting all the other types of teachers in this country. I come from a long line of teachers. My mother was a schoolteacher. My wifes a schoolteacher. My three daughters are trained teachers. Two of them teach young kids at .the elementary level. God bless them. and une of them is a professor at Baylor University. The hnost influential person that taught me in public school was my seventh grade Texa! history teacher. Ms. Wilson But teaching isnt just a tradition in my family. Teaching has been a tradition in this country since its very inception. At our Nations founding. of course. most of the teaching happened at home under the instruction of parents. Today. parents have many options when it comes to the education of their children. Some are taught in private schools. others in public schools. Some are charter schools. and. others continue to be educated at home. Regardless of where the education takes place. teachers play a primary role in equipping our youth to be good citizens. to take pride in the democratic heritage of our Nation. and to be competitive in the marketplace of ideas. An American author and historian Henry Adams once said. ""A teacher affects eternity. The teacher can never t6ll where that influence stops."" Mr. Adams was right.

1110019580,Mr. President. last week the junior Senator from Louisiana offered an amendment to the Omnibus appropriations bill that would change the way the costofliving adjustments are given to Members of the House and the Senate. The bill before us. which has already passed the House. ensures there will be no costofliving adjustment in 2010. Most Senators. me included. have indicated support for that provision that is in this bill. Senator VITTERs amendment would require the House and the Senate to vote every year on costofliving adjustments rather than having those adjustments take effect immediately. I agree with Senator VITrER that costofliving adjustments for Members of Congress should not be automatic. That is why I introduced a freestanding bill last week that would do just that. That is why we seek consent to pass this bill before we are scheduled to vote on the amendment by the Senator from Louisiana. By passing this legislation as a standalone. it can become law without threatening completion of this appropriations bill. If Senators want to demonstrate their support for the proposed automatic costofliving adjustments. they can and should support my standalone legislation. It is fiscally responsible. responsible to the state of our economy. and will allow us to continue the good progress we have made toward passing this bill. . Objecting to this request will have two negative results: It will jeopardize our ability to pass legislation ending the automatic COLAs. and it will deal a serious blow to our efforts to pass this appropriations bill. Any Senator who wishes to end the automatic COLA should support this consent request I will shortly make. Likewise. any Senator who wishes to move forward with the omnibus will support my request. The only way to accomplish these objectives is to support my request. take up and pass the standalone pay adjustment bill. I urge all of my colleagues to support this unanimous consent pay request. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 29. S. 542. a bill which repeals the provisions of law to provide for an automatic pay adjustment to Members of Congress. that the bill be read three times. passed. and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table. This is a serious piece of legislation. It accomplishes what the Senator from Louisiana obviously wants to accomplish. I would hope we can do this tonight.

1110041478,Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of House Resolution 448. I have the privilege of representing a part of the University of California at Davis. It is a privilege because U.C. Divis is truly one of the premier- institutions of higher learning in our Nation. Since the University first opened its doors to students in 1908 as an agricultural research institution it has played a critical role in the growth of California agriculture as one of our States major industries and a producer of food for the world. At a time when the delivery of health care services is an issue of such paramount importance to our Nation it should be acknowledged that the Medical Centerat U.C. Davis serves as the primary acutecare trauma center for millions of residents in our region. It should also be mentioned that the University is recognized for its work as a top tier research hospital. While the veterinary school at the U.C. Davis is recognized as one of the finest such schools in the Nation. I would be remiss not to point out that its law school has also attained the highest standards of excellence. U.C. Davis is the home of the California Biomass Collaborative- which is a statewide collaborative of govemment. industry. environmental groups. and educational institutions administered for the state by the University of California. Davis. The Cbllaborative is sponsored by the California Energy Commission as well as other agency and private industry partners. I worked with the Collaborative in putting together a Biomass Policy Forum last fall to discuss the use of woody biomass as a viable atemate energy source. as well as a means by which to reduce the threat 6f wildfires. The University has also done tremendous work in the field of sustainable transportation. and is the new hub of collaboration and research on plugIn hybrid electric vehicles in California. Such vehicles have zerotailpipe emissions and could well be the future of clean transportation. In my capacity as a member of the Committee on Homeland Security I am particularly interested in the work conducted by the University through the Westem Institute of Food Safety and Security. WIFSS. regarding the need to protect our Nations feedstock from the threat of bioterrorism. Furthermore. U.C. Davis is engaged in cuttingedge research regarding flame retardant materials which has both civilian as well as military applications.

We shouldnt raise taxes during a recession on anyone that pays taxes. Tax increase will do several things. Small businesses that pay most of the taxes. they will have a tax increase.

1110007784,"I thank the Chair. My decision to support Mr. Holders nomination does not come easily. Certainly. Mr. Holder has an outstanding reputation as a career prosecutor and an effective litigator. and he has received strong support from prominent government and former government officials on both sides of the aisle. However. I have been concerned about a number of aspects of Mr. Holders nomination. First. I have been deeply troubled by Mr. Holders poor decisionmaking in the case of the pardon of Mr. Rich and the FALN members. Also. I have been concerned about his past comments regarding the second amendment. even after the Supreme Court rendered its proindividual rights decision earlier this year. Most notably. I have been concerned about some of the comments related to intelligence activities that Mr. Holder made in past public speeches and during his recent confirmation hearing. As vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee. I want to ensure that the intelligence community has the tools it needs to protect the country. and I want to make sure we will have an Attorney General in place who will help keep America safe. In an effort to gain some clarity on Mr. Holders current thinking on these issues and concerns. he met with me privately to discuss them. We discussed. for. example. the Presidents Terrorist Surveillance Program. the FISA Amendments Act. the intelligence communitys Detention and Interrogation Program. Guantanamo Bay. various interrogation legislative proposals. the applicability of the writ of habeas corpus to terrorists. renditions. and media leak investigations. A few days later we had a second meeting to discuss further the issues of great concern to me and my position on the Intelligence Committee. notably. the carrier liability provisions in the FISA Amendments Act and the propriety of investigating intelligence officials who acted in good faith and with proper authorization in the conduct of intelligence interrogations. There have been some confusing press reports about my meetings with Mr. Holder as well as statements from Senators who were not in attendance at those meetings about it. So now is probably a good time to set the record straight. First. it should go without saying that neither Mr. Holder nor I made any pledges or promises with respect to his nomination. We met. rather. so that we could share our perspectives on these very important issues. In those meetings. Mr. Holder provided me some additional insight that assures me he and the Department of Justice will be looking forward to keeping the Nation safe. I invite my colleagues attention to the following written assurance given by Mr. Holder to Senator KYL about a week ago concerning the investigation of intelligence officials conducting interrogation activities. He said: Prosecutorial and investigative judgments must depend on the facts and no one is above the law. But where it is clear that a government agent has acted in responsible and good faith reliance on Justice Department legal opinions authoritatively permitting his conduct. I would find it difficult to justify commencing a full blown criminal investigation. let alone a prosecution. During our meeting. Mr. Holder expanded on these remarks and explained why he had reached that conclusiona conclusion with which I happen to agree. While his public answer to Senator KYL and my main emphasis during our meetings focused on the intelligence officials who followed DOJ legal guidance and not on those who either wrote that legal advice or authorized the intelligence activities based upon such advice. I told himand I believe he understoodthat trying to prosecute these lawyers or political leaders would generate a political firestorm. Besides interrogation. .we focused during both meetings on the issue of carrier liability protection under the FISA Amendments Act. During Mr. Holders confirmation hearing. Senator HATCH asked him whether he would honor the carrier liability certifications issued by Attorney General Mukasey. Mr. Holder answered that he believed he would honor those certifications unless circumstances changed. I have asked Mr. Holder if he could explain the ""changed circumstances"" which would cause him to withdraw the existing certifications. noting that it would be difficult for circumstances to change since all this happened in the past. was considered by the Senate and the House. we wrote a bill. and under which the Attorney General made a judgment based on those .circumstances. Mr. Holder didnt give any specific examples of changed circumstances. but he planned to review the certifications to which he has not had access if confirmed. Given that those certifications are based upon relatively simple. classified facts. I am certain he will reach the same legal conclusion as Attorney General Mukasey. and I am comfortable with his thinking on the matter as he described it to me. I cannot stress enough to my colleagues and the American people the importance of the carrier liability protection provisions in the.FISA Amendments Act. These provisions not only put an end to the frivolous lawsuits brought against the carriers alleged to have participated in the terrorist surveillance program. they also increase the likelihood of future cooperation with the intelligence community by the carriers as the community strives to keep us safe within the bounds of 1aw. I also stressed the fact that Mr. Holder is not readinor given accesseither to the terrorist surveillance program or the interrogation program. so it would not be advisable to make any definitive statements about either program without the pertinent facts. and he agreed with me on this point. I enjoyed my meetings with Mr. Holder. While we did not agree on every issue. I appreciated his stated willingness to keep an open mind until he has had a chance to review the classified facts involved in most of these intelligence issues. I found Mr. Holder to be a good listener. which is an important prerequisite for any good leader. I believe him when he says he is willing to take good ideas from wherever they come. As his predecessor. General Mukasey. he will. I believe. be an Attorney General more interested in justice than in politics. Now. I understand a number of my colleagues will not support Mr. Holders nomination. I respect their legitimate concerns about his unsatisfactory performance in the Rich and FALN pardons. I. too. have real problems in these matters. Pardoning Marc Richan international fugitive from justicewas certainly a stain on the Presidency and Mr. Holders record. Mr. Holder told me. as he said publicly. that his role was a mistake he regrets. I believe he genuinely knows what he did was wrong and would not do such a thing again. Similarly. I suppressed my concerns to Mr. Holder regarding his role with the Puerto Rican FALN group. I disagree with him that granting clemency to such people even after the time they served could ever be appropriate. but he has told me that regardless of whether we agree that it was acceptable in a pre9/1l world. he would not view similar future requests in the same manner in our post91l world. In that respect. I believe Mr. Holder fully supports an aggressive stand against terrorists today. I am hopeful he has learned important lessons from these events. When confirmed. Mr. Holder will be taking over the Department of Justice that is stacked with legal talent. I wish to take a moment to note that the Nation owes a great debt of gratitude to the Department of Justice. During the past several years. we have worked very closely with the Department on many important pieces of national security legislation. including the PATRIOT Act. the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act. the 9/11 Recommendations Implementation Act. the USA Patriot Improvement and Reauthorization Act. the Protect America Act. and of course. the FISA Amendments Act. I am very grateful for the dedicated efforts of the National Security Division. the Office of Legal Policy. the Office of Legal Counsel. and the FBI in assisting us with these various legislative matters. I also commend those on the frontline for their untiring service and efforts to keep us safe from the many and diverse threats against our national security while ensuring that our civil liberties are protected. I expect that Mr. Holder and the Department of Justice will continue this tradition. and I look forward to working with Mr. Holder closely on PATRIOT Act sunset issues and other important national security matters during this Congress to protect our Nation.

1110011896,Madam Speaker. I yield myself 4 minutes. Madam Speaker. we have often been accused of trying to push this bill rapidly through the Congress. In fact. we have been trying to push a recovery package through this Congress for the last 150 days. We began this process in September when we tried to persuade the previous Bush administration of the necessity to support an economic recovery package. That White House would have none of it. Nonetheless. we put together a packagevery modest in size compared to this onetrying to look for anything that President Bush would sign. and that product was well known. It has evolved gradually since that time as the economy has descended further and further and further into a recessionary and deflationary spiral. We now have had this legislation in both the House and the Senate appear on the Web. Our committee. as soon as we produced the final product in the House. placed the bill on the Web. And the Senate placed the Nelson amendment. which is the amendment that they are now operating on. they placed it on the Web as well. So I think both Chambers have demonstrated that they are trying to do every bit that they can to provide transparency for the process. I have no objection to what the language in this motion to instruct conferees says. I do have one caution: every day that we do not take action. an additional 20.000 Americans lose their jobs. And that is accelerating. I dont intend to go anywhere. The Speaker has made it quite clear that this Congress is not going to go home for its Presidents Day recess until this package is finished. So we are scheduled to adjourn for that recess on Friday. But I have no problem sticking around for as long as it takes to get the job done. I would point out that theres considerably less to this proposal than meets the eye because all it does is to require the text of the proposal to be available to the managers of the bill. And I suspect that the managers. who will be participating in these discussions. will know literally from moment to moment exactly what it is that they are doing. I am sure that each and every person appointed to be managers on both sides of the aisle will be reasonably competent so that they can do that. So I would simply point out the effectiveness is simply to delay consideration of this legislation when it does come back from conference. If that is what Members want to go on record as supporting. I have no objection whether this passes or not. I will be around as long as it takes. and. frankly. I expect it is going to take a whole lot longer than just this week.

Ted Williams and Johnny Pesky Bills roommate. As a naval aviator. Bill fought heroically and was awarded the Air Medal and Presidential Unit Citation for his wartime service. having deployed to fight in the Pacific. where he valiantly flew F6F Hellcats and Lockheed Venturas. While Bill departed from active military service in 1946. his commitment to veterans and a lifetime of advocacy on their behalf was just beginning. Bill was a founding member of American Legion Post 153 in Auburn. where he held several offices at both the local and State levels including adjutant. vice commander. and department commander. On the national level. Bill became Maines national executive committeeman. a member of the liaison committee to the National Public Relations Commission. and from 1965 to 1966 national vice commander. In 1976. Bill received the tremendous distinction of being elected national commander of the American Legion. the first national commander from the State of Maineand we could not have been more proud. Traveling more than 300.000 miles throughout the world in all 50 States and 17 countries. Bill was the voice of Legionnaires and veterans. meeting with leaders such as President Ford and President Carter. Maine and our Nation could not have had a better champion for the American Legion and our brave and noble veterans than Bill Rogers. Throughout his life. in word and deed.

I would also like to thank Ranking Member BOOZMAN and the committee staff for their hard work and commitment to advancing this legislation. The Water Quality Investment Act will renew our commitment to clean water in America and provide funding to chip away at the tremendous backlog of water infrastructure needs across the Nation. This legislation will increase investment. reduce costs. and promote efficiency in our water infrastructure. I am particularly proud of Title IV of the bill that provides monitoring. reporting. and public notification of sewer overflows. My good friend. Mr. LoBIONDO of New Jersey. and I have worked to advance this issue for several years through independent legislation. the Sewage Overflow Community RightToKnow Act. that is a part of this legislation. Sewer overflows discharge roughly 850 billion gallons of sewage annually into local waters. These discharges end up in local rivers. lakes. streams. and the ocean. The best way to avoid health and environmental concerns from sewer overflows is to ensure that they never occur in the first place. a primary goal of this legislation. However. even with significant increases in investment. sewer overflows will .continue to occur. Therefore. it is imperative that we provide the public with comprehensive and timely notification of sewer overflows. which is also accomplished in this bill. Mr. Chairman. the Water Quality Investment Act makes investments today to protect our families tomorrow.

It was named by the county commissioners of. Cambria County. This airport serves 1.000 military personnel. It serves the Pennsylvania National Guard. It serves the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve and the U.S. Army Reserve. and these units have been deployed 28 times in the last 10 years in service of the United States abroad.

And if 100 different resolutions had been introduced. I can imagine that they would have covered 100 different aspects of his life. They would have said. he was a scholar. because when John Hope Franklin was researching African American history in this country. there really was no written African American history in this country. And he had to beg his way into the Library of Congress. into places where nobody African American had ever leally spent any time to try to find the history and place African Americans in a particular reserved place. tracing their ancestry all the way back into Africa. and giving us the due that we were entitled to have as part of this. the history of this country. A resolution might have talked about his being the first. because theres a whole list. We could take 20 minutes on our side just listing the things that John Hope Franklin was the first to do. the first to be an African American head of a Department of History. the first to do this. the first to do that. We could devote a whole resolution to him as a historian. because the wonderful work that he authored. ""From Slavery to Freedom."" helped to define the role of African Americans in this country. We could do a resolution listing just the honors that he received. the nufiber of honorary doctorates and prizes and awards that he received for his scholarship and his participation. We could do a resolution on his commitment to growing tulips. Heres a man that has had an tulip named after him because he took a liking to tulips. and really went in and probably has the best understanding and the best collection of tulips of any individual in America. We could do a resolution on his landmark participation. the fact that he was part of the research team that did Brown v.

1110012579,Mr. Speaker. I rise today to honor the distinguished gentleman from Michigan. JOHN DINGELL. has now become the longest serving Member of the U.S. House of Representatives. While Mr. DINGELLS service to this Congress is worth recognition alone. his many accomplishments ensures that he will go down as one of the most influential members in the history of Congress. JOHN DINGELLs service to this body started all the way back in 1938. when he served as a Page. Later on. he served in the United States Army leaving with the rank of Second Lieutenant. In 1955. Mr. DINGELL was sworn into office to succeed his father and began a remarkable and productive career as a Member of the House. In 1981. Mr. DINGELLS tenure as the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee began and continued until this very year. I have served with Mr. DINGELL on the Energy and Commerce Committee for 16 years. In all that time. he always treated Republicans with respect even when we vociferously disagreed. which was fairly often. He was always fair and willing to work to find common ground. He is a true model for all of us to follow. Mr. DINGELL has received so many awards and so much recognition in his career. that I do not have time to list them all. So Ill highlight a few. He has received recognition from the NAACP for his avid support of civil rights and from the NRA for his support of the Second Amendment. In addition. Mr. DINGELL has been Congress most outspoken and tireless advocate for the American automobile industry. which is a key component of our nations economy and of particular importance to the district he represents. In closing. lets all honor JOHN DINGELL for his vigorous and unflagging support for this institution and for his long and productive tenure in Congress.,111117140,STEARNS,CLIFFORD,H,FL,M,R,6,voting,2009-02-11,300,Mr. STEARNS,23195,23238,02112009.txt,1785,312,111,2009,mr speaker rise today honor distinguish gentleman michigan john dingel becom longest serv member us hous repres mr dingel servic congress worth recognit alon mani accomplish ensur go one influenti member histori congress john dingel servic bodi start way back serv page later serv unit state armi leav rank second lieuten mr dingel sworn offic succeed father began remark product career member hous mr dingel tenur top democrat energi commerc committe began continu year serv mr dingel energi commerc committe year time alway treat republican respect even vocifer disagre fairli often alway fair will work find common ground true model us follow mr dingel receiv mani award much recognit career time list ill highlight receiv recognit naacp avid support civil right nra support second amend addit mr dingel congress outspoken tireless advoc american automobil industri key compon nation economi particular import district repres close let honor john dingel vigor unflag support institut long product tenur congress,156,FALSE
1110035135,Mr. President. this year marks the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Daughters of Penelope. I rise today to introduce with my colleague. Senator MENENDEZ.. a resolution honoring their history of selfless service and achievement during these eight historic decades. Founded November 16. 1929. in San Francisco. CA. the Daughters of Penelope was established to improve the Wellbeing of women and provide them with the opportunity to make significant contributions to American society. Today its mission is to promote the ideals of ancient Greeceeducation. philanthropy. civic responsibility. family. and individual excellence through community service and volunteerism. An affiliate organization of the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association. AHEPA. a leading association of American citizens of Greek heritage and Philhellenes. the Daughters of Penelope have worked both within and beyond the GreekAmerican community to achieve remarkable accomplishments. Over its history. its members have tirelessly sought to strengthen the status of women in society. shelter the elderly and the abused. educate our youth. promote Hellenic heritage. and raise funds for medical research. One project adopted by the Daughters of Penelope is particularly near and dear to my heartits charitable aid to St. Basil Academy. a Greek Orthodox Archdiocese home for children in need. which I attended for several years. Beginning in 1954. the Daughters of Penelope have been providing charitable aid to St. Basil Academy when it embarked on a Christmas Seal Campaign to raise funds to build the new water works for the Academy. Since then. the Daughters of Penelope contributed to the furnishing of new buildings that have been built on campus. built a heated outdoor swimming pool for the children. and has provided funds for ongoing maintenance and renovations to the Academy for such items as replacing outdated appliances and wornout roofs. In matching their own personal achievement with the desire to help others also achieve their goals. the Daughters of Penelope exemplify the very best in American and Hellenic values. As they embark on another 8 decades of service and accomplishment. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating them on their distinguished past. and wishing them every success in the future.,111116501,SNOWE,OLYMPIA,S,ME,F,R,,voting,2009-04-29,210,Ms. SNOWE,17120,17187,04292009.txt,2321,355,111,2009,mr presid year mark th anniversari found daughter penelop rise today introduc colleagu senat menendez resolut honor histori selfless servic achiev eight histor decad found novemb san francisco ca daughter penelop establish improv wellb women provid opportun make signific contribut american societi today mission promot ideal ancient philanthropi civic respons famili individu excel commun servic volunteer affili organ american hellen educ progress associ ahepa lead associ american citizen greek heritag philhellen daughter penelop work within beyond greekamerican commun achiev remark accomplish histori member tirelessli sought strengthen statu women societi shelter elderli abus educ youth promot hellen heritag rais fund medic research one project adopt daughter penelop particularli near dear charit aid st basil academi greek orthodox archdioces home children need attend sever year begin daughter penelop provid charit aid st basil academi embark christma seal campaign rais fund build new water work academi sinc daughter penelop contribut furnish new build built campu built heat outdoor swim pool children provid fund ongo mainten renov academi item replac outdat applianc wornout roof match person achiev desir help other also achiev goal daughter penelop exemplifi best american hellen valu embark anoth decad servic accomplish ask colleagu join congratul distinguish past wish everi success futur,203,FALSE
1110049035,Madam Speaker. many countries. including China and European nations. are continuing to move to clean energy. such as nuclear power. The United States. the nuclear power pioneer. lags far behind in the development of new generating plants. The United States could and should move to the licensing and development of more nuclear *power plants. Nuclear power is an efficient and a cheaper way of providing clean energy to Americas manufacturing sector. We should streamline the long cumbersome process of power plant applications that use safe reactor designs. designs that have already been approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Progress. safety and costs have advanced to a state that America can safely store spent nuclear fuel rods and also recycle fuel. One of Americas most impressive plants is the North Anna Nuclear Station here in nearby Virginia. Nuclear power is responsible for 20 percent of our energy. but in France 80 percent of. their energy comes from nuclear energy. Nuclear power will keep jobs in America and help free us from the shackles of foreign control of our energy.

1110001885,Let me clear up the data on the Wyoming Range. It is said there is only 1.5 trillion cubic feet. according to the U.S. Geologic Survey. But you have not read the complete report. The letter is new. The data used by them is older than the data used by the Bureau of Land Management. It wasnt based on the latest topographic and geological studies. That is the first problem. The second thiig they say in their report is they lacked an official map. So it is their best guess. not based on science. not based on known data. Finally. they only approximated for the following reasons: They only had a general outline of the area and they assumed a homogenous distribution of oil and gas resources across the- entire area. Well. that is a no report. The latest report to come from the National Petroleum Council. which is subcontracted to BLM. estimates. at a minimum. 12 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. So where you get your information and what it says and what it is based on is very important. So we have had all this defense that this is not going to impact energy based on an erroneous report based on erroneous assumptions by the National Geologic Survey. when all you have to do is read their own survey and that is the footnote to it. which says we didnt have the information. we didnt have the map. so we used an average. not what was there. Having known that the first three gas wells drilled there had to be capped because we didnt have the technology to take the flow. it was so great. the estimates by the USGS are so far out of range it is laughable. As far as 10 years counting whether it is going to have any impact on our energy. I hope we are thinking longer than 10 years. But that is what the CBO says they are going to use 10 years. Dont forget there is another big issue with this bill in that we step all over property rights in this country. Even though several of the bills in here say they would not use eminent domain. every one of them still has the right to use eminent domain outside the areas we have created in this bill. So we have taken one of the basic rights of Americans in this country. and the Senate. in passing this bill. by saying: Sorry. our parochial interests for what we want to do for the State trumps your property rights. If you believe in property rights. if you believe people who own land ought to have the right to develop that land. if you dont think the Federal Government ought to be funding those people who will take away your rightswhich is what they will do with the heritage areas. they actually change the zoning laws as funded by the U.S. Park ServiceI have a bridge I want to sell you. We ought to be about doing what is in the best interest of the country. not what is in the best interest of our States right now. Our problems are severe. We ought to be doing things that develop confidence in this body. not undermining the confidence in this body. As far as the land exchanges. almost none of those was objected to. They could have come through here on unanimous consent. and everybody knows that. To use that as a reason for why we are at this point is not only insincere. it is inaccurate. So it is time for us to start behaving and acting in ways that restore confidence in this body and setting priorities that are very similar to the priorities every family has to set. I will say. again. we should have spent the last 2 weeks working on waste and fraud and duplication in the Federal Government because we are getting ready to approve a bill that will spend $800 billion at the same time we know we are going to waste $300 billion in -this Government. For us to spend time on this bill rather than the important things that are going to make a difference in the lives of families in this country in the long run.

The form of my resolution is as follows: Whereas. The Hill reported that a prominent lobbying firm. founded by Mr. Paul Magliocchetti and the subject of a ""federal investigati6n into potentially corrupt political contributions."" has given $3.4 million in political donations to no less than 284 members of Congress. Whereas. the New York Times noted that Mr. Magliocchetti ""set up shop at the busy intersection between political fundraising and taxpayer spending. directing tens of millions of dollars in contributions to lawmakers while steering hundreds of millions of dollars in earmarks contracts back to his clients. "" Whereas. a guest columnist recently highlighted in Roll Call that "". . . what [the firms] example reveals most clearly -is the potentially corrupting link between campaign contributions and earmarks. Even the most aident earmarkers should want to avoid the appearance of such a paytoplay system."" Whereas. multiple press reports have noted questions related to campaign contributions made by or on behalf of the firm. including questions related to ""straw man"" contributions. .the reimbursement of employees for political giving. pressure on clients to give. a suspicious pattern of giving. and the timing ef donations relative to legislative activity. Whereas. Roll Callhas taken note of the timing of contributions from employees of the firm and its clients when it reported that they ""have provided thousands of dollars worth of campaign contributions to key Members in close proximity to legislative activity. such as the deadline for earmark request letters or passage of a spending bill. Whereas. the Associated Press highlighted the ""huge amounts of political donations"" from the firm and its clients to select members and noted that ""those political donations have followed a distinct pattern: The giving is especially heavy in March. which is prime time for submitting written earmark requests."" Whereas. clients of the firm received at least three hundred million dollars worth of earmarks in fiscal year 2009 appropriations legislation. including several that were approved even after news of the FBI raid of the firms offices and Justice Department investigation into the firm was well known. Whereas. the Associated Press reported that ""the FBI says the investigation is continuing. highlighting the close ties between specialinterest spending provisions known as earmarks and the raising of campaign cash."" Whereas. the persistent media attention focused on qiestions about the nature and timing of campaign contributions related to the firm. as well as reports of the Justice Department conducting research on earmarks and campaign contributions. raise concern about the integrity of Congressional proceedings and the dignity of the institution.

1110043375,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. we have some speakers on our side who have some time constraints. and I dont want to utilize a lot of time on my statement right now. so I just want to make a few opening comments. if I may. First of all. it seems like only days ago that we were here doing the House version of this bill. and the reason for that is we were here only days ago doing the House version of this bill. The speed with which this legislation has passed through both bodies. while not suggesting that it was done in haste. this is a wellcrafted proposal. but rather suggests the importance of this acquisition reform initiative. recognizes. as well. the unanimity of feeling amongst all the Members of both the House and the Senate as to the ta.k before us. And I think its a tribute as well to the President. who called some of us down to the White House and told us that he fully supported this initiative and urged us to work as expeditiously as we could. Todays bill is a result of that effort. and I certainly want to start by thanking my dear friend. my partner. and my chairman. IKE SKELTON. the gentleman from Missouri. for providing his leadership that brought the House and. particularly. the House Armed SerVices Committee. into this ery. very important discussion that has developed this very. very important piece of legislation. As my distinguished chair said. we owe our thanks to many. and I want to give a special tip of the hat to as well. my friend. the gentleman from New Jersey . my partner. our representative on the special panel. MIKE CONAWAY. the gentleman from Texas. and all of the special panels members who really did an outstanding job in meeting with -the department representatives and discussing the initiatives with representatives of industry and Members of poth Houses of the legislature. and broukht this important bill before us. It is a critical measure and it really is a bestofallworlds proposal. It portends the opportunity to save literally hundreds and hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars. dollars that now probably go to expenses and to costs that should and could be avoided and. as well. ensures that every tax dollar we do spend goes appropriately to providing the best weapons systems we can to keep those brave men and women in uniform safe. who do such an amazing job with us. I join my chairman. Mr. SKELTON. in urging all Members to soundly and enthusiastically. and with great pride. support this conference report.

1110008273,Mr. President. I will speak briefly. I believe Senator MIKULSKI is perhaps going to offer the next amendment. I do not want to disadvantage the time that has been allotted. I did want to. however. point out that I intend to talk about three amendments very briefly. I filed two of them. I will file the third shortly. All of us understand what has happened in recent months. In the last 4 or 5 months we have seen money go out the backdoor of this Government unlike any time in the history of our country. In fact. you can read the U.S. Constitution. I dont think you can find a place in the Constitution that describes the mechanism by which massive amounts of money have gone out of this Government-$8.5 trillion. to the extent we now know how much has been moved from our Government to support various enterprises. The reason we know that is Bloomberg News sued the Government and the Federal Reserve Board. which is the only way anybody got the information about how much money has been obligated by the Federal Reserve Board which opened its discount window for the first time in history to investment banks. It has never before happened. How much money was committed? We know some snippets of all of that. We know that. for example. Citigroup got about $45 billion. and then we are told we have reached an agreement. along with the direct funding to Citigroup. that we are guaranteeing nearly $300 billion for toxic assets for Citigroup. We know that. We know how much has gone to some of the other investment banks. We know how much money went -to AIG. We have a notion of how money went in certain directions. But no one knows exactly how much went out of the Federal Reserve Board. to whom. in what direction. for what purpose. How much from the FDIC. how much from TARP. when. why. how muchwe dont know the answers to all of those questions. Here is what I propose: Last week there was a lot of discussion about bonuses. I believe last year the Wall Street investment firms lost $35 billion in income and paid $18 billion in bonuses to their employees. I dont know. I have a masters in business. We went through a lot of casework in business school. I dont think I came across a case that said: Here is good businesslose $35 billion and then pay $18 billion in bonuses. I dont guess I saw that in the Harvard Business Review. One amendment is. we ought to. as a government. have the right to understand what kind of bonuses are being paid by firms that are receiving financial assistance under the structure of the financial assistance that has been offered by our Government. I propose an amendment. It is an amendment that would report bonuses to the American taxpayers. I want all companies receiving emergency economic assistance from any Federal financial agency to publicly release information on any bonuses paid. including the bonus recipients and the amount of the bonuses. The American people have a right to that information. After all. these are companies that have asked for and received Federal assistance. Lets have the American public be able to shine a spotlight on what has happened to that money. including. especially. the use of that money potentially for bonuses. Second is an amendment I have filed that is what I call the Jobs Accountability Act. This is all about creating jobs. If we are. in fact. about creating jobs. then this proposal would be to say we should have quarterly reports in the Congress after this legislation is passed because tens of billions. hundreds of billions of dollars will have been spent in the pursuit of creating new jobs. Why is that °important? Mr. President. 20.000 people will likely learn today they lost their job. 20.000 people today and every day. 2.6 million last year. and they say 2.6 million more in the first 6 months of this year. This is a deep crater. We have to care about trying to create jobs. putting people back on payrolls to give them some hope and some confidence again. If we are spending money to do that in what is called an economic recovery program. lets try. to track that money. This amendment is very simple. It is the Jobs Accountability Act. What I propose is that when this money goes out the door to the recipients--State governments. local governments. and otherswe ask them to file quarterly reports with the Congress to say three things: One. I received the money. two. here is how I spent the money. and. three. here is how many jobs I estimate we created with this money. It is the only place we will get this kind of information. Does anybody think we ought to just ship money out the door and not ask for some sort of reporting requirement about how many jobs we created? Otherwise. it is sort of the helicopter theory of money. Get the money in bags. take it up in a helicopter. shove it out the side. and let it scatter. That is not what this is about. We are supposed to be focusing like a laser on jobs. Lets get the reports from everybody who received this funding in order to determine the effect of what we have done. That is an amendment I have filed. The third amendment I have not filed but will file today is the issue of runaway manufacturing plants. It is something I have worked on in the past with my colleague from Maryland. Senator MIKULSKI. This is an interesting proposition. We are trying to create jobs because we are losing jobs in this country. We have a perverse provision in our Tax Code that says this: If there are two companies in Maryland right across the street from each other. making exactly the same product to be sold in this country. in our marketplace. and one of them. on a cool January day. decides: You know what. I am leaving Maryland. I am getting rid of my workers. I am moving my production to China and I will make that product by hiring 30centanhour labor and I will ship the product back to America to be soldafter that transaction is done. What is the difference between the company that stayed in Maryland and the company that left Maryland to produce in China? The difference is the American company that left and got rid of their jobs and moved to China has a tax bill that is lower than the company that stayed. We actually provide in this tax system of ours the most pernicious incentive I can imagine. and that is an incentive to say to companies: If you have a choice. we will actually pay you an incentive in the Tax Code to move your jobs overseas. My runaway plant amendment will fix that situation. I have offered it. I believe. four times with my colleague from Maryland and some others. We have come up short four times. But we have a lot of new Senators who I think would very much like to vote on this amendment. We also have a new President who campaigned on it. a new President who went all across this country and said: Lets stop the incentives for shipping jobs overseas. This is the perfect place. it seems to me. to have this vote. The reason is because we have a tax bill on the Senate floor now. This is. it seems to me. exactly the wrong incentive. If we are trying to create jobs. why should we have provisions in our Tax Code that move jobs elsewhere? Lets plug that hole. and we can do it with the amendment I will be offering. My amendment has had over the years many cosponsors and the strong support of my colleague from the State of Maryland. I will file that amendment today. A tax bill is on the Senate floor. If not now. when should we ever plug this loophole that says as a country. we stand behind shipping jobs overseas. Lets say we stand behind keeping jobs here.

1110047380,Mr. Speaker. I rise today in strong support of the resolution before the House sponsored by my very good friend. Representative LOUISE SLAUGHTER. condemning the senseless killing of Dr. George Tiller. Dr. Tiller. as we have heard. was gunned down while serving as an usher during church services last week: We are blessed in this country to have the freedom of speech. freedom of assembly. and freedom to protest. Our country has a rich history of nonviolent protests from the womens rights movement to the civil rights movement to the gay rights movement. Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr.. preached nonviolence. and his great movement heeded this. call in the face of unspeakable acts of violence from their opposition. This shooting is. in the words of the New York State Catholic Conference. a terrible perversion of what it means to be prolife. While we may have differefit views of this issue. no side should resort to atrocious acts of violence such as this. Since 1977. there have been more than 5.800 reported acts of violence against providers like Dr. Tiller. Since 1993. eight people have been murdered. and there have been 17 attempted murders since 1991. Clinics like Dr. Tillers over a 20year span have been bombed 41 times and faced 175 arsons and 96 attempted bombings and arsons. I understand that this is a passionate issue for both sides. but we cannot allow this to continue.,111121570,TONKO,PAUL,H,NY,M,D,21,voting,2009-06-09,308,Mr. TONKO,21539,21577,06092009.txt,1390,236,111,2009,mr speaker rise today strong support resolut hous sponsor good friend repres louis slaughter condemn senseless kill dr georg tiller dr tiller heard gun serv usher church servic last week bless countri freedom speech freedom assembl freedom protest countri rich histori nonviol protest women right movement civil right movement gay right movement dr martin luther king jr preach nonviol great movement heed call face unspeak act violenc opposit shoot word new york state cathol confer terribl pervers mean prolif may view issu side resort atroci act violenc sinc report act violenc provid like dr tiller sinc eight peopl murder attempt murder sinc clinic like dr tiller year span bomb time face arson attempt bomb arson understand passion issu side allow continu,122,FALSE
1110053942,"Madam Speaker. I am going to begin by doingsomething thatI dont believe I have ever done when managing a rule here in the HouseTraditionally when Mr. BOEHNER. our. Republican leader. gets up or my Rules Committee colleagues. Messrs. DIAzBALART and SESSIONS or Ms. Foxx. would stand up here. we rise to basically make the case for Members of the minority. Were Republicans. We make the Republican case about how important it is for us to ensure the rights of the minority. something that- James Madison talked about very eloquently 220 years ago. Today I rise on behalf of all of my colleagues. and I rise. especially today. for Democrats because its unprecedented that we would be in the circumstance that we are today. Now Ive seen an awful lot in this institution in the years that Ive been privileged to serve here. Ive observed the way this House is run. In most instances. under both Democrats and Republicans. I have been very proud of the work product that has emerged. But in many of those instances. I have been less than proud of the way the greatest deliberative body known to manor what has been described as such by people like the distinguished Chair of the Committee on Appropriations. Mr. OBEY. is no longer the greatest deliberative body known to .man. or at least. we.re slipping away from thatbecause were undermining the deliberative process. .Usually.when we get offtrack. which has happened under both Republicans June24. 2009 and Democrats. and put our shortterm goals ahead of the longterm interest of the- institution. it is not a good thing. It is. we often believe. noble for us to put our shortterm goals there because we have an important priority. When my friends in the majority asked the Nation to give them control of this House. they correctly citicized me personally and others within the Republican leadership because we said that we limited their voices in amendment and debate. It didnt happen often. but it did happen. And I will say that without the ability to offer improvements to legislation and ideas. Members of this body could not do the job that they are charged with doing. and that is. pursuing the hopes. dreams and aspirations of their constituents. We all represent a little less than threequarters of a million people. and we have a responsibility. Democrats and Republicans alike. to do just that. Thats why I say again. Madam Speaker. I rise in support of the effort to ensure that my Democratic colleagues are not shut out of this process. Now as you know very well. Madam Speaker. when our California colleague. Speaker PELOSI. took the gavel. she promised that they woulddo better than I did as chairman of the Rules Committee. and better than our Republican leadership had done in the past. Unfortunately this rule before us really illustrates just how far we have fallen from those great words- that were put. forward by Speaker PELOSI. With this rule. its very difficult for me to know exactly where to begin with criticism. but lets start with the very nature of the rule itself. We all know that the House has allowed less debate and fewer amendments in its consideration of bills over the last few years. The one great exception to that has been the appropriations process. Why? Because we all know article I. section 9 of the Constitution places the responsibility to spend the peoples money in our hands as Members of Congress. Weve always taken this responsibility very seriously in a bipartisan way. And weve alwaysunder both Democrats and Republicansallowed Democrats and Republicans to engage in a freeflowing and rigorous debate. Everyone is very. very concerned about what happened last week. My Democratic colleagues are concerned with -the nuhnber of. votes that were held and the outrage that we dem.onstrated. We Republicans are horrified that we began. down that route. Unfortunately. last weeks act was just the warmup to what were seeing today. Today we are beginning what can only be described as the main event. This is because todays rule will become the model for every appropriations bill that we consider in the future. It is very likely that this rule. Madam Speaker. will become the model for every bill that we consider in this Congress. Rather than any Member. Republican or Democrat. being able to offer any germane amendment on behalf of their constituents and the Nation. this resolution from the Rules Committee. under the direction of Chairman OBEY and Speaker PELOSI. limits what ideas can be debated on this floor. and as I said. it limits the ideas proposed by my Democratic colleagues. So anyone who wants to say that Im standing here. Madam Speaker. just whining on behalf of the minority. it is preposterous. Democrats sat in line before the Rules Committee until nearly 11 oclock last night. and Democrats have been shut out of this process. So unfortunately I. representing the minority. am the only one who can stand here on behalf of our Democratic colleagues. It means. unfortunately. that our constituentsand I say this to my colleaguesour constituents in Democratic districts and Republican districts alike are unfortunately being held hostage by the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. If hes having a bad day. the American people will have no recourse. That means that our constituents concerns about spending will go unheeded. and we all know that thats what this is about. If you doubt it. look no further than last weeks funding bill for this institution alone. We fought for several amendments that could bring about a reduction in the 16.2 percent increase in spending for the Legislative Branch appropriations bill. We had some large cuts. but we had the most modest cut imaginable. The gentleman from Georgia offered an amendment in the Rules Committee to allow for a onehalf of 1 percent reduction in the 16.2 percent increase that we put into place. While the American people are struggling to -make ends meet. while people are trying. to keep their jobs. their homes. we in this institution allowed for a 16.2 percent increase. and we simply said in the appropriations process that maybe we should debate on the floor whether or not we would have a onehalf of 1 percent cut. Unfortunately that was completely denied. I also want to take a moment to discuss some of the more creative aspects .of this rule. as were read by the Reading Clerk. For the first time ever. the rule allows the Chair to impose 2minute voting. Now previously 2minute voting was something that was done with a bipartisan agreement. Democrats and Republicans came together and said. We have got so many votes here. rather than having Members sit around with 5minute voting. we would agree to 2minute voting. Now I will say that ignoring this process that has existed in the past. including the provision that allows the Chair to actually impose 2minute voting. we ignore the stress that 2minute voting places on the nonpartisan professionals who tally our votes. It increases the opportunity for error. I would commend to my colleagues the report of the Select Committee to Investigate the Voting Irregularities of August 2. 2007. and on page 10 under The Events Surrounding Roll Call Number 814. it makes very clear that one of the factors involved in this was the fact that there were 11 2minute votes held leading up to that. I know full well. as I look at the wonderfully dedicated and hardworking rostrum staff. what a litany of 2minute votes is imposed on them. And we want to make sure thatwhat happened on August 2 of 2007 never happens again. And allowing the Chair to impose 2minute voting does create the potential for that. I also have to say. Madam Speaker. that Im very concerned about the fact that this rule does create a scenario that puts people in an awkward position. I have a number of very. very close friends with whom I have been privileged to serve here. One of those is my colleague from North Carolina . who works closely with Mr. ROGERS in a bipartisan way dealing with the issue of our Nations homeland security. I have already said. Madam Speaker. that I am very troubled with amendment No. 68 that was put forward. and I dont mean to get too far down into the weeds here. but we have another unprecedented action put into place here. Amendment No. 68 simply said. page 93. line 13. ""strike the."" This is the amendment that was submitted to the Rules Committee. This amendment was submitted. and a revised version of it was submitted. and now. Madam Speaker. the revised version makes in order seven amendments.-one of which actually required waivers to allow it to proceed. Now. this has not been done before and its unfortunate. It was really sort of a bait and switch. We saw this amendment that said ""strike the."" and then its revised all of a sudden with seven amendments being -made in order. Unfortunately. this is not the kind of transparency that we were promised when the new majority came to power. There are other elements to the rule that I dont want to discuss. but suffice it to say that each and eveiy provision of this rule. Madam Speaker. is designed to restrict and limit the rights of Democrats and Republicans to debate and improve this bill. as has always been done in the 220year history of this great institution. Now. why is any of this important? Because. Madam Speaker. process is substance. In committee there were many amendments defeated even though they would have gone a long way to improving the bill and reducing problems like illegal immigration. an issue that Mr. ROGERS has worked very closely on.

1110061647,We are going to take the shoe store guy and say. You focus on that. We. the government. have an infrastructure that we know that works for health care.

We should make it less expensive. not more expensive for citizens. because we shouldnt say.

1110029155,"I thank the gentleman for yielding. And. Madam Chair. I rise to oppose this Democratic budget. As we have heard repeatedly tonight. it spends too much. it taxes too much. and it borrows too much. But I want to be fair to my friends on the Democratic side. There is one area of the budget where there is a glaring exception to that rule. and that is the defense of the United States of America. Over the course of a 10year projected Obama budget. we will move from 20 percent of the Federal budget down to 14 percent devoted to defending the country. We will move from just over 4 percent of the gross national product to 3 percent to defend the United States of America. We will risk canceling major weapons systems. like the future combat system. a tanker that will. help us project air power around the world and missile defense. at a time when the North Koreans and the Iranians are developing missiles. That risks jobs. that risks security. That is reckless in a dangerous world. That is not just my opinion. Madam Chairman. Let me read from Robert Samuelsons recent article. ""Obama. the Great Pretender."" ""It would be responsible for Obama to acknowledge the big gamble in his budget. National security has long been governments first job. In his budget. defense spending drops from 20 percent to 14 percent of the total from 2008 to 2016. the smallest share since the 1930s. The decline presumes a much safer world. If the world doesnt cooperate. deficits will grow."" More importantly. American soldiers and American security will be at risk. Madam Chairman. So lets reject this budget because it does spend too much. it does borrow too much. it does tax too much.

1110015301,"Mr. President. today I will once again introduce with the senior Senator from Mississippi. Mr. COCHRAN. the Senate Campaign Disclosure Parity Act. a bill to require that Senate candidates file their campaign finance disclosure reports electronically and that those reports be promptly made available to the public. This step is long overdue. indeed I first introduced this bill in 2003. I hope that the Senate will act quickly on. this legislation this year. A series of reports by the Campaign Finance Institute has highlighted the anomaly in the election laws that makes it nearly impossible for the public to get access to Senate campaign finance reports while most other reports are available on the Internet within 24 hours of their filing with the Federal Election Commission. FEC. Thi Campaign Finance Institute asks a rhetorical question: ""What makes the Senate so special that it exempts itself from a key requirement of campaign finance disclosure that applies to everyone else. including candidates for the House of Representatives and Political Action Committees?"" The answer. of course. is nothing. The U.S. Senate is special in many ways. I am proud to serve here. But there is no excuse for keeping our campaign finance information inaccessible to the public when the information filed by House candidates or others is readily available. My bill amends the section of the election laws dealing with electronic filing to require reports filed with the Secretary of the Senate to be filed electronically and forwarded to the FEC within 24 hours. The FEC is required to make available on the Internet within 24 hours any filing it receives electronically. So if this bill is enacted. electronic versions of Senate reports should be available to the public within 48 hours of their filing. That will be a vast improvement over the current situation. which. according to the Campaign Finance Institute. requires journalists and interested members of the public to review computer images of paperfiled copies of reports. and involves a completely wasteful expenditure of hundreds of thousands of dollars to reenter information into databases that almost every campaign has available in electronic format. The current filing system also means that the detailed coding that the FEC does. which allows for more sophisticated searches and analysis. is completed over a week later for Senate reports than for House reports. This -means that the final disclosure reports covering the first two weeks of October are often not susceptible to detailed scrutiny before the election. According to the Campaign Finance Institute. in the 2006 election. ""[v]oters in six of the hottest Senate races were out of luck the week before the November 7 election if they did Web searches for information on general election contributions since June 30. . . . In all ten of the most closely followed Senate races voters were unable to search through any candidate reports for information on pregeneral election (October 118) donations."" And a September 18. 2006. column by Jeffery H. Birnbaum in the Washington Post noted that ""When the polls opened in November 2004. voters were in the dark about $53 million in individual Senate contributions of $200 or more dating all the way back to July .. "" Because the Senate failed to pass this bill last Congress. even though we had 48 bipartisan cosponsors and no known opposition. and even though the Senate Rules Committee reported the bill by voice vote. the same problem existed for Senate elections in the 2008 cycle. In addition. because of the expense. when the FEC puts information from the paper filings in its electronic database. it only enters contributions. not expenditures. So anyone interested in how a Senate campaign is spending its money has to consult the paper forms. As Roll Call said in its recent editorial in favor of the bill. ""[ilts time for this nonsense to come to an end."" It is time for the Senate to at long last relinquish its backward attitude toward campaign finance disclosure. I urge the enactment of this simple bill that will make our reports subject to the same prompt. public scrutiny as those filed by PACs. House and Presidential candidates. and even 527 organizations.

1110045750,"Mr. President. I rise in support of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. We all know someone who is currently a smoker or someone who has been a smoker. I know we all worry about their health. That is with good reason. Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States. It kills more people each year than alcohol. AIDS. car crashes. illegal drugs. murders. and suicides combined. Let me repeat that because it is hard to believe. The fact is. tobacco .use kills more people each year than alcohol. AIDS. car crashes. illegal drugs. murders. and suicides combined. Tobaccorelated health problems affect millions more. resulting in skyrocketing health care costs every year. The cycle of addiction is so hard to break. and the tobacco companies work hard to attract smokers with flashy marketing campaigns and by including chemicals that are proven to be addictive. Undoubtedly. this hurts our Nations overall health. There is no question that one of the most important steps the Senate can take to improve health and to reduce costs is to reduce the use of tobacco. That is why this legislation is so important. why I am proud to be one of the 53 cosponsors of this legislation. Again. over half the Senate is cospon.soring this legislation. I thank Senator KENNEDY for his leadership and work on this important issue over so many years. I thank Senator DODD for managing this bill on the floor. Throughout my career. I have advocated for smoking prevention. We all .realize the cost in lives and in health care expenses that smoking creates. not only to the consumer but also to those wlo are exposed to the dangerous secondhand smoke. In New Hampshire. almost 20 percent of adults smoke cigarettes. and tobaccorelated health care expenses in New Hampshire amount to $969 million a year. During my tenure as Governor. I was proud to sign legislation that banned the sale of tobacco products to minors. that prohibited the possession of tobacco products by children. and that required the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services to disclose harmful ingredients in tobacco products. The important legislation we are considering expands on what New Hampshire has done. It will give the FDA the authority to regulate the manufacturing. marketing. and sale of tobacco products. In New Hampshire thisyear alone. 6.300 children will try cigarettes for the first time. Just over a third of these children will become addicted lifelong smokers. The tobacco companies know these statistics and target much of their marketing to this vulnerable population. In fact. published research studies have found that children are three times more sensitive to tobacco advertising than adults and are more likely to be influenced to smoke by marketing than by peer pressure. This year in New Hampshire alone. the tobacco companies will spend $128 million on marketing. much of it geared to kids. Tobacco companies also attract children to their products by using flavors. such as. Twista Lime or Kauai Kolada. which says it contains Hawaiian hints of pineapple and coconut."" or Winter Mocha Mint. It doesnt sound like we are talking about tarfilled cigarettes. does it? It sounds like we are talking about ice cream or candy. But. unfortunately. these fruit and mint flavors not only entice kids to try them but also makes the smoke less harsh. more flavorful so it is actually easier for kids to smoke. Unfortunately. they do not make cigarettes less dangerous or less addictive. The tobacco companies do hot stop at just the flavors to attract kids. They package the flavored products in colorful and fun patterns clearly aimed at attracting children to their products.. Norma Gecks of Derry. NH. reports that her youngest child is 19 and is addicted to smoking. He buys the mintand fruitflavored products and by now is smoking up to two packs a day. Already at age 19. he has dbveloped a smokers cough. Keith Blessington of Concord is now an adult. but he is also a victim of childhood addiction. He smoked his first cigarette after a basketball. game when he was only 17. Recently. he was diagnosed with advanced stomach cancer and told me he has about a year to. live. Despite this awful situation. despite the fact that he has cancer. he will tell you plainly: I am addicted. He cannot quit. We need to enact this legislation to help people in New Hampshire and across the country. people such"" as Keith. people such as Normas son. Tobacco products and marketing geared to kids need to end. We cainot afford to let another generation of young people put themselves at risk by becoming addicted to tobacco products and suffering the lifelong consequences of their addiction or. even worse. dying. For decades. tobacco companies have targeted women and girls. But in the last 2 years. the industry has significantly stepped up its marketing efforts aimed at our daughters and granddaughters. and we have a picture of one of the ads R.J. Reynolds uses. It is their new version of Camel cigarettes targeted to girls and women. and it is Camel No. 9sort of a takeoff on some other product descriptions we have heard. This cigarette has sleek. shiny black packaging. flowery ads. and. as you can see. the enticing slogan ""light and luscious."" This advertisement has appeared in Cosmopolitan. Glamour. InStyle. Lucky. and Marie Claire magazines. and it has been effective. Today. about 17 percent of adult women and about 19 percent of high school girls are smokers. That is more than 20 million women and more than 1.5 million girls who are at increased risk for lung cancer. for heart attacks. strokes. emlihysema. and other deadly diseases. These statistics are staggering. and it is important to remember they represent mothers. grandmothers. aurts. sisters. colleagues. and friends. Seventeenyearold Cait Steward of Dover. NH. has seen these Camel No. 9 advertisements. She saw them in Glamour magazine. But fortunately. she sees through the marketing campaign. She says: Tobacco companies advertise to try and get me and my friends to smoke. They try to make young girls think that smoking is sexy. glamorous. and cool. They know that if they get us to start smoking now we will be addicted for years to come. -It is not just cigarettes that we are attempting to regulate in this legislation. The tobacco companies have also developed new products that are both smokeless and spitless. They are just as addictive as those products you smoke. -however. and they are just as deadly. Like cigarettes. they do not have any FDA regulation. and the consequences are dire. I want to show a photo of a young man named Gruen Von Behrens. He is an oral cancer survivor. He has had more than 40 surgeries to save his life. including one radical surgery. and you can see how it left him in this picture. It removed half his neck muscles and lymph nodes and half of his tongue. Like too many teenagers. Von Behrens first tried spit tobacco at age 13 to fit in. By age 17. he was diagnosed with cancer. How can we let this happen? Tobacco companies are targeting our children. and it is our job to protect them. This legislation is vital to our children and to our Nations health. It will prevent the tobacco companies from marketing to children. It will require disclosure of the contents of tobacco products. authorize the FDA to require the reduction or removal of harmful ingredients. and force tobacco companies to - scientifically prove any claims about reduced risk of products. The FDA is.the proper place to have this authority. It is responsible for protecting consumers from products that cause them harm. The FDA even regulates pet food. Yet it doesnt havethe authority to provide oversight for tobaccoone of the most dangerous consumer products sold in the United States. Under this legislation. the FDA will oversee tobacco products with the same objective and the same oversight with which it directs all of its activitiesto promote and protect public health. It has the necessary scientific expertise. regulatory experience. and public health mission to do the job. We cant wait any longer to make the necessary changes that will impact the lives of so many people we know and love. Again. I thank Senator KENNEDY for his outstanding leadership on this issue and join many of my colleagues in supporting this important legislation that .will save lives in New Hampshire and across the country.

1110040875,"Mr. President. I rise todaywith my colleagues Congresswoman ROSA DELAURO and Congresswoman ALYSON SCHWATZtO introduce the Informed Consumer Choices in Health Care Act. legislation to hold insurance companies accountable by increasing transparency in insurance coverage and to provide consumers critical information about their health care so they can make Informed decisions. All Americans deserve affordable. meaningful health care coverage that meets their needs when they need it. However. there is an unsettling trend in America that is growing at an alarming ratehardworking Americans are suffering from serious economic hardship because of medical bills. -There countless consumers all across the country who thought they were safe because they had health insurance coverage. Health insurance is meant to protect against the risk that. if you get sick. severely injured or require extensive medical care for one reason or another. it would not bankrupt you. However. the exact opposite is happening. People who thought they had coverage for health care eventssmall and largefound out -much too late that they were not protected at all. The lack of insurance transparency leads consumers to purchase coverage that actually does not meet their needs and. leads to disaster for them financially. In June 2008. the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on health insurance reform where we heard devastating testimony from Mrs. Lisa Kelly. who purchased a limited benefit plan that did not provide adequate coverage when she needed treatment. for leukemia. Mrs. Kelly paid a monthly premium of $185 for AARPs Medical Advantage plan. underwritten by UnitedHealth Group. only to be told that she had to pay M.D. Anderson $105.000 up front. prior to starting her chemotherapy treatment. This situation left Ms. Kelly in the untenable situation of leaving her cancer untreated or finding- a way to pay on a limited budget. Medical bills are the second highest cause of bankruptcy in our country. It is estimated that 50 percent of all bankruptcies are a result of medical expenses. Sixtyone percent of the 72 million adults under age 65 who had problems paying medical bills or were paying off medical debt in 2007 were insured at the time health care was provided. An additional 1.5 million families lose their homes every single year due to medical costs. This is simply unacceptable. This is not just a coincidence. Plans that provide barebones coverage may be fine if you live in a bubble. but that Is not the reality most Americans live in. If we as a nation are serious about protecting all Americans from the devastating financial consequences of serious illness. then Congress must hold the insurance Industry accountable by arming consumers with comprehensive information about the benefits covered and not covered under their health plan. the true cost of their coverage. and the costsharing they are responsible for. This information should not be shrouded in the legalese .of health insurance companies. but in clear language that is easy for consumers to understand. As we seek to give consumers greater coverage choices. we should also give them the necessary tools to understand those choices. Another example of where the lack of insurance transparency has hurt consumers is in the experience of the Medicare prescription drug benefit. Seniors and individuals with disabilities have simply been overwhelmed by the number of prescription drug plans offeredwithout any meaningful way to decipher the differences between plans in terms of benefits covered .or costsharing. Over the last recess. I held a health care roundtable discussion in Charleston. which has more than 50 Medicare prescription drug plans for seniors and individuals with disabilities to chooge from. I heard from countless West Virginians about the extreme difficulty they have wading through their prescription drug coverage options each and every plan year. The most compelling stories came from a retired chemical engineer and a retired attorneyboth very smart individualswho have had major problems determining what is and is not offered and how much they will have to pay out of their pockets for it. When - consumers buy cars. computers. or even cereal. they generally know what they are buying and how niuch it will cost. But. when it comes to makingchoices about health care coverage. it is often very difficult for consumers to tell what is actually covered and how much they will have to pay outofpocket in case of a serious illness or injury. Consumers cannot make meaningful choices if details about coverage are obscure or if the definitions of key terms such as ""h6spitalizatioi"". ""outpatient care"". or ""outofpocket limit"" vary from plan to plan. The lack of health insurance transparency also contributes to administrative waste and complexity. According to the American Medical Association. more than half of health insurers do not provide physicians with the transparency necessary for an efficient claims processing system. Physicians and hospitals must divert substantial resources away from patieiit care to accurately determine patient insurance eligibility and benefit structure. The black box in which insurers operate also provides them with the opportunity to use flawed payment structures. like the Ingenix database. to underpay patients who choose to get health care out of network. An investigation by the -New York Attorney General and hearings conducted this spring by the Senate Commerce Committee revealed American consumers have been paying billions of dollars out of their own pockets for health care that the insurance companies should have been paying. The numbers the insurance industry relied on justify these underpayments came from a secretive health care data company called Ingenix. Insurers refused to tell patients or doctors how Ingenix came up with their payment amounts. And they didiit disclose that Ingenixwas a wholly owned subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group. the Nations second largest health insurance company. The Ingenix investigations show tat the health insurance industry is willing to go to great lengths to withhold accurate. .objective health care payment information from American consumers. While they talk about transparency. they spent hundreds of millions of dollars creating a reimbursement system that kept patients and doctors in the dark. The U.S. Department of Labor currently lacks the capacity to oversee insurance industry compliance with federal health insurance laws and to provide states with the technical assistance necessary to effectively enforce federal standards for health insurance. These federal standards include crucial protections like the Genetic Information and Nondiscrimination Act. GINA. the Health Insurance -Portability and Accountability Act. HIPAA. the Newborns and Mothers Health Protection Act. the Womens Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998. Michelles Law. and mental health parity. As states continue to be overwhelmed by the increasing pressure of the recession and costcutting measures by insurers. state regulators are in desperate need for additional resources. In a 21st Century health system where there will be even greater health insurance choices. adequate federal oversight is absolutely critical. There is no excuse for limiting Lccess to information that has such widespread consequences for consumers. The Informed Consumer Choices in Health Care Act is the type of transformative legislation we need to address the very gignlficant issues sten)ming from the lack of health insurance transparency. First. this legislation promotes transparency In coverage by providing crucial data and assistance to consumers and health care providers. This includes new ""Coverage Facts"" labels for insurance. similar to nutrition labels. which accurately portray the financial obligations of patients in a given year under various medical scenarios. The legislation also requires the development of consistent standards for insurance. including standard definitions of. key insurance terms to be used in descriptions of plan benefits. so that consumers can make ""apples to apples"" comparisons of coverage options. Lastly. it strengthens insurance accountability and oversight by creating a new Office of Health Insurance Oversight within the Department of Health and Human Services. and provides new resources for states to help enforce federal standards. In the most recent Presidential election. the voice of American voters was clearthey want medical care they can afford ano health care coverage they can trust. The traditional role of insurers to hide or misrepresent insurance coverage options can longer be tolerated. therefore. I urge my colleagues to stand up for informed consumer decisions in health care and support this bill. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and support material be printed in the RECORD.",111117461,ROCKEFELLER,JOHN,S,WV,M,D,,voting,2009-05-14,183,Mr.

1110004442,Mr. Speaker. I rise today to applaud the bold leadership coming from our new administration. Today President Obama signed executive orders to put an end to destructive policies of the Bush administration. Americans. and people all over the world will know. once again. that the United States rejects the use of torture and that we will proceed with the rule of law. With his announcements this morning. President Obama is taking an important step for undoing the damage that has been caused over the past 8 years. The prison at Guantanamo Bay and the horrors at Abu Ghraib have so stained the honor of the United States that it will take years to regain the trust of the international community. Under the past administration the world saw a White House that operated in secrecy and was all too eager to bend and break the rule of law when it was convenient to do so. Progressives fought every step of the way and demanded an end to torture and the closure of Guantanamo Bay. President Obama is living up to his campaign promises. and he is signaling to the world a return to the very values that have led our Nation to be viewed as the greatest democracy on earth. our unyielding commitment to the rule of law and profound respect for human decency. This Congress stands ready to help the administration. Whether its bringing an end to prisons like Guantanamo or bringing our troops home from Iraq. we pledge to help the President forge a new path for America and for the world. Again. Mr. Speaker. I applaud the administrations bold move forward. and I will commit to supporting our renewed role as world leader for justice and human rights.,111117200,WOOLSEY,LYNN,H,CA,F,D,6,voting,2009-01-22,210,Ms. WOOLSEY,7477,7523,01222009.txt,1643,290,111,2009,mr speaker rise today applaud bold leadership come new administr today presid obama sign execut order put end destruct polici bush administr american peopl world know unit state reject use tortur proceed rule law announc morn presid obama take import step undo damag caus past year prison guantanamo bay horror abu ghraib stain honor unit state take year regain trust intern commun past administr world saw white hous oper secreci eager bend break rule law conveni progress fought everi step way demand end tortur closur guantanamo bay presid obama live campaign promis signal world return valu led nation view greatest democraci earth unyield commit rule law profound respect human decenc congress stand readi help administr whether bring end prison like guantanamo bring troop home iraq pledg help presid forg new path america world mr speaker applaud administr bold move forward commit support renew role world leader justic human right,149,FALSE
1110022261,Mr. President. for several months now we have been discussing earmarks or congressionally directed spending. This body has heard many false charges about earmarks. We have heard that earmarks amount to wasteful spending. We have heard that taxpayers should not support these projects. We have even heard that earmarks dont actually benefit our States. Fortunately. my constituents understand that the rhetoric on earmarks doesnt match the facts. Nevadans know that these projects are brought to me by. their mayors. council members. and city managers. Nevadans know that. as their Senator. I understand their needs better than a faceless bureaucrat in Washington. And most importantly. Nevadans know how valuable earmarks are in a small State like ours to expand medical services. build infrastructure. and provide other services. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD the following editorial from Las Vegas ReviewJournal columnist John L.

1110066651,Madam President. I would like to commend and congratulate my colleague Senator ROBERT BYRD on the momentous accomplishment of becoming the longest serving Member of Congress. Senator BYRD has spent 56 years and 320 days serving the people of West Virginia. in that time casting more than 18.500 votes. He is a fierce advocate for his home State of West Virginia. a mentor and disciplinarian with new Senators. And he possesses an encyclopedic knowledge of Senate history. rules. and procedure. The current President pro tempore of the Senate. he has held more leadership positions than anyone in Senate history. I am honored to have worked alongside a man who will go down in history as a great American public servant. and I look forward to working with Senator BYRD for years to come.,111118141,CASEY,ROBERT,S,PA,M,D,,voting,2009-11-18,627,Mr. CASEY,39773,39796,11182009.txt,786,133,111,2009,madam presid would like commend congratul colleagu senat robert byrd moment accomplish becom longest serv member congress senat byrd spent year day serv peopl west virginia time cast vote fierc advoc home state west virginia mentor disciplinarian new senat possess encycloped knowledg senat histori rule procedur current presid pro tempor senat held leadership posit anyon senat histori honor work alongsid man go histori great american public servant look forward work senat byrd year come,74,FALSE
1110033141,Madam President. I will object. and I will just take a moment to explain. First off. I would note. as he . typically does. the Senator from Arizona came and talked to me before and was very straightforward with what he was going to do. This talks about recoveries available under the False Claims Act. I think the Senate expert on the False Claims Act is Senator GRAsSLEY. a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Senator GRASSLEY opposes this. as do I. I know there are going to be other amounts the distinguished Republican leader is going to bring up. but my reason in opposing themand he has explained each one of them to me ahead of time. so there is no surprisebut I will oppose them because I believe without whistleblpwers. a lot of these billions of dollars in fraud that have been found wouldnt have been found. Without the whistleblowers. the Governmentthe American taxpayerswouldnt recover so much. The False Claims Actand. again. Senator GRASSLEY and others were the leaders in putting that togetherhas brought back more than $22 billion into the U.S. Treasury. Now. it has a balanced approach in providing incentives for said whistleblowers. They share in such recoveries if it is warranted and if it is approved by the judge. A judge has to approve it. It has worked out very well. Rather than there being an arbitrary cap. I would rather leave it to the judge to make the determination. Simply saying. well. we will. limit it to three times the cost. then I worry about seeing a padding of expenses. I think it is very well balanced the way it is. including having a judge make the final decision. I think one of the things we all agree uponI am sure the Senator from Arizona and I agreeis that we have to find fraud. we have to root it out. and we have to bring those who commit fraud to justice. What I am thinking about. as Senator GRASSLEY has pointed out in the past. as have I. we have to give an incentive to the Whistleblowers to bring the case. After all. we have seen all too often a whistleblower will alert us to the fraud. and the first thing that liappens is they lose their job. They often risk retaliation. In fact. if they are turning in their coworkers or their supervisors and bringing out the fraud. this could be lifealtering. It could actually change their professional career. often for the worse. .They are looked at as the bad guys. but they are not the bad guys. they are the good guys. We ought to reward them. I will vote against it in this case. I object to considering it. I know the Senator from Arizona is going to have further amendments. but I just want him to knowand I want my colleagues to know what I have told him privately. I commend him foras we have always done in cases we have hadtalking to me ahead of time. as I have with him when I have had amendments or matters that may involve him.

1110046073,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself the balance of the time. In closing. I would emphasize the importance of passing the Transportation Security Administration Authorization Act. This bill is the first comprehensive authorization bill for TSA since its breation in 2001. It is the product of extensive bipartisan negotiation and reflects input from GAO. DHS. IG and oversight conducted by the Committee on Homeland Security. It makes major investments in surface transportation and triples the overall funding for TSA activities. Mr. Chairmap. let me for the record sa:i that there are 239 detainees presently housed at Gitmo. Under this legislation. all those individuals. if they were found innocent or guilty. will go on the No Fly List. So there is no question about the intent of this legislation to put those individuals on the No Fly List. Apart from that. this is a good bill. and I urge its adoption.,111121500,THOMPSON,BENNIE,H,MS,M,D,2,voting,2009-06-04,427,Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi,30826,30852,06042009.txt,902,149,111,2009,mr chairman yield balanc time close would emphas import pass transport secur administr author act bill first comprehens author bill tsa sinc product extens bipartisan negoti reflect input gao dh ig oversight conduct committe homeland secur make major invest surfac transport tripl overal fund tsa activ mr let record sai detaine present hous gitmo legisl individu found innoc guilti go fli list question intent legisl put individu fli list apart good bill urg adopt,76,FALSE
1110004741,Madam President. I am afraid the Ledbetter bill is another example that the majority in the Senate doesnt understand the American ecolw omy or how businesses create jobs or how freedom works for all of us to create a better quality of life. Recessions are caused by uncertainty. This bill creates more uncertainty for the very businesses we need to create the jobs and to keep the jobs we have in our country today. Why would we pass a bill. or even be talking about it. in the middle of a recession. that many have said is the worst we have ever seen in our lifetime? This bill will also create a lot of unintended consequences that will do the exact opposite of what it is intended to do. I was in business for well over 20 years before I came to Congress. Once you create more liability for hiring a woman or know that liability is going to exist for years. employers are going to figure out a way to get around that. This is more likely to discourage the employment and the promotion of women because it creates an indefinite liability. It seems that a lot of my colleagues have never been in business themselves. I remember being in the advertising business. and I was 1 of 15 account executives. I was about in the middle as far as salary. There were men and women who made less than I did. There were men and women who made more than I did. Some who made more than I did had less experience. but because of clients or some other factorsome other intangibleit made them worth more than I was. they were paid more. It was the same with those who made less. I Was younger and in some cases less experienced than some of the men and women who made less. but I had demonstrated that I could help our company make a profit more than they had. The market was deciding our salaries. There is no way that anyone in this Senate or any government bureaucrat or Federal judge could come in and say that there was discrimination because I was paid less than someone who was making more money or the same with someone who was making less than I was. For us to intervene and create a permanent liability is only going to create more uncertainty. This is not what we need to do with our businesses. So thi whole bill should not even be considered now. I have anamendment that gets at some of the issues that have been talked about with this bill. about fairness and about discrimination. One of the biggest forms of discrimination in this country today is when we force an American worker to join a union. My amendment is a righttowork amendment. Right now in this country. we have a Federal law that forces American workers to join a union. States can pass a righttowork law. as my State. South Carolina. has to protect their workers. but this has proved very difficult for many States with powerful union bosses and unibn lobbies. My amendment. which is a national righttowork amendment. would restore the right of every American not to join a union. It would eliminate the Federal requirement that workers pay union dues. We are getting ready to hear from some opponents of this amendmeint that will use some very convoluted logic to defend their position. Th same people who support Federal labor laws. including wage requirementsthau supersede State laws. will argue that my amendment violates States rights. Removing a Federal mandate on States could only violate States rights in the minds of politicians who have los touch with our constitutional moorings. My amendment is not about States rights. It is not about Federai rights. It is not about business rights. My amendment restores  basic unalienable. individual rights. No lawFederal or State--should force an American to join a union in order to get a job in this country. No lawState or Federal- -should allow an American worker to be fired because he or she does not want to join a union. This is about individual rights. There should not be a Federal law that discriminates against workers who choose not to join a union. This is about fairness and about stopping basic discrimination that is sponsored by this Federal Government. I urge my colleagues to vote for this righttowork amendment. It is very consistent with the theme of this Ledbetter bill. It is more likely t eliminate discrimination than the Ledbetter bill itself. I urge my colleagues to support it. I will reserve thu remainder of my time and ask for a vote.,111117241,DEMINT,JIM,S,SC,M,R,,voting,2009-01-22,509,Mr. DEMINT,18324,18461,01222009.txt,4383,785,111,2009,madam presid afraid ledbett bill anoth exampl major senat doesnt understand american omi busi creat job freedom work us creat better qualiti life recess caus uncertainti bill creat uncertainti busi need creat job keep job countri today would pass bill even talk middl recess mani said worst ever seen lifetim bill also creat lot unintend consequ exact opposit intend busi well year came congress creat liabil hire woman know liabil go exist year employ go figur way get around like discourag employ promot women creat indefinit liabil seem lot colleagu never busi rememb advertis busi account execut middl far salari men women made less men women made made less experi client made worth paid made less younger case less experienc men women made less demonstr could help compani make profit market decid salari way anyon senat govern bureaucrat feder judg could come say discrimin paid less someon make money someon make less us interven creat perman liabil go creat uncertainti need busi thi whole bill even consid anamend get issu talk bill fair discrimin one biggest form discrimin countri today forc american worker join union amend righttowork amend right countri feder law forc american worker join union state pass righttowork law state south carolina protect worker prove difficult mani state power union boss lobbi amend nation righttowork amend would restor right everi american join union would elimin feder requir worker pay union due get readi hear oppon use convolut logic defend posit th peopl support feder labor law includ wage supersed state law argu amend violat state right remov feder mandat state could violat state right mind politician lo touch constitut moor amend state right right busi right amend restor basic unalien individu right forc american join union order get job countri feder allow american worker fire want join union individu right feder law discrimin worker choos join union fair stop basic discrimin sponsor feder govern urg colleagu vote righttowork amend consist theme ledbett bill like elimin discrimin ledbett bill urg colleagu support reserv thu remaind time ask vote,349,FALSE

1110067767,Mr. President. I rise to speak in support of the amendment proposed by Senator LINCOLN from Arkansas. I thank her for an excellent idea. At the outset. before I came to the Senate. I was a founder and CEO of a major New York Stock Exchange companya company now employing over 40.000 people. I say that because I do understand how business works. I know we have to pay executives to encourage their full capacity. But the money being paid to top health insurance executives is simply outrageous. Most of these companies where these executives work get subsidies from the Federal Government through payments to Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D. Our tax dollars then wind up stuffing the pockets of insurance company executives. Remember. these companies are obliged to provide health care funding when people are ill or need counseling to improve their health and their longevity. The average compensation package for the top five insurance chief executives between 2006 and 2008 was almost $15 million a year. I think their services in these companies more closely resemble a fire department or an emergency response organization than a traditional product producer or a Wall Street firm. These companies are not selling lawnmowers. They have a different obligation. to provide a guarantee to help people maintain better health. which is essential for individuals and should be great for our country. Our country will save money by reducing overhead and improving programs that will fight to help people live better and longer. As their executives make millions of dollars every year. their customers are getting messages such as this: Sorry. this operation or that operation is not covered by your policy. or. we dont pay for that kind of medication. Here is an example that really lays it out perfectly. There is a company called UnitedHealthcare. It is a major health insurance company. After that company engaged in the practice of backdating hundreds of millions of dollars in stock optionsand that was done to get an even better price than the shielded gain they getafter backdating hundreds of millions of dollars of stock options. their CEO. William McGuire. was forced to quit for his questionable performance. Despite this scandal. United gave Mr. McGuire a golden parachute of more than $1 billion. Where did that money come from? It came from the pockets of senior citizens and from the people who had programs that were covered by this company-$1 billion for an outgoing CEO who engaged in misconduct. while hardworking. everyday Americans get turned down for needed and critical medical procedures. There was a disease in that boardroom when they permitted those inexplicable decisions. While health insurance executives have been gouging working families. they are gorging themselves with their outrageous pay. corporate jets. and other perks. A cancer victim may not get critical chemotherapy. A family may not be able to cover the ravages of a child with diabetes. But health insurance company executives draw down millions of dollars. It doesnt add up. This amendment will not tell insurance companies what they can pay their executives. They can pay them whatever they choose to. But only $400.000 annually can be treated as an expense. That is what the President of the United States makes. The rest of it will be taxed. with those funds going to make Medicare more solvent. Again. the Lincoln amendment wisely uses that new tax revenue generated by this measure to further shore up Medicare. An observation I wish to make is that I have listened to the debate over a long period of timenot just in recent weeks but long before thatabout getting health care improved for the people across our country. the over 40 million people who cannot go to a doctor but who will go to an emergency room. draw a ticket as if they are waiting for a table in a restaurant. and hope they get seen before some critical disease gets worse. What we hear is objection after objection. They like the status quo. They have their friends in the industry. Look at the advertising budgets we see and the percentage of commercials paid for by those who are opposed as contrasted with those who desperately need the insurance. We are seeing now. for instance. that one element of our reform program is the government plan. the plan that makes the industry more competitive. the public option. We hear all kinds of reasons why that cannot be. What is the ultimate conclusion? It is that this lush field these insurance companies plow day after day. year after year. should be held intact. It is the wrong way to go. I say to them: Stand up. say you dont want 40 million people. or somewhere near that number. to get health care coverage. Say they dont deserve it because they may not be able to afford it. Say you dont deserve it. you dont have the money to pay for it. Who do you think you are. citizens of this country. People who are here. who have worked. in many instances. who have lost jobs in this recession. are being toldthey dont use the language but the message is clearyou dont deserve it. But they want the insurance company executives to be treated particularly well. We need clarification of the thinking of the Republicansand I have a lot of good friends over there. and I know there are a lot of good thinking people. But when the Senator from South Carolina said publicly that if we can bring down this health care plan. we will present a Waterloo for President Obama. what they are seeking is a political victory. They are not seeking to help people who are desperate. More people are worried about the loss of their health insurance than they are about their jobs because a job of some sort often can be available. But if you lose your health care. if you have a condition that the insurance company is not going to cover. you are in deep trouble. I plead with my colleagues and I plead with the people across our country who may hear our voices to protest this assault against logic. this assault against those who need help. those who understand that government can be better. I was a young boy when I enlisted in the Army. 18. My father was sick with cancer. He was 42 years old when he was diagnosed with cancer. He was a healthy man. He used to work out at the Y and take care of himself. but cancer overtook him and after 13 months of illnessa painful illness because they did not have the materials in those days to reduce the pain victims felthe died. leaving a 37yearold widow. my mother. who not only was griefstricken but flat broke. no money.

1110000819,Mr. President. Im proud to join Senator MiKuLSKI in introducing this legislation. Equal pay for equal work is a fundamental civil right. Over the past 4 decades. America has made enormous progress toward ensuring that all its people have an equal chance to enjoy the benefits of this great Nation. Bipartisan civil ights bills have been enacted to expand and strengthen the law to ensure fair pay for all workers. Despite these advances. civil rights is still Americas unfinished business. It is therefore fitting that we open the 111th Congress with introduction of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. This bill will restore the basic right of all workers. regardless of their race. sex. religion. national origin. age. or disability. to be paid fairly. free from discrimination. It will restore workers rights to challenge ongoing discrimination and hold unscrupulous employers accountable. This legislation is needed because the Supreme Court turned back our Nations progress on equal pay with its Ledbetter decision. which undermined a core protection of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and overturned decades of precedent that had established a fair. workable rule for challenging pay discrimination claims. This needed bill will restore the longstanding rule that each discriminatory paycheck is a separate wrong that may be challenged by workers within the required period after receiving.the check. In the Ledbetter case. a jury had found that Lilly Ledbetter was paid less than her male coworkers because she was a woman. The jury awarded back pay to Ms. Ledbetter. but the Supreme Court reversed that award. holding that she had waited too long and should have filed her lawsuit within a short time after Goodyear first began discriminating against her. Never mind that the company discriminated against her for decades. and that the discrimination continued with each new paycheck she received. Far too often. workers like Lilly Ledbetter put in a fair days work. but go home with less than a fair days pay. Women. AfricanAmerican. and Latino workers all earn a fraction of what white male workers make. Many qualified older workers and workers with disabilities also are paid less than their coworkers for reasons unrelated to their performance on the job. Its more important than ever that we attack the problem of pay discrimination and correct the injustice caused by the Ledbetter decision. In the current economic crisis. millions of American workers are struggling to make ends meet. Pay discrimination makes that struggle harder. and workers cant afford to lose more. economic ground. To protect these workers. we must move quickly to pass the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. I urge my colleagues. Republicans and Democrats alike. to do so. and to send a strong signal that this new Congress is dedicated to standing up for fairness and equality in the workplace. The Lilly Ledbetters of our Nation deserve no less.,111114941,KENNEDY,EDWARD,S,MA,M,D,,voting,2009-01-08,107,Mr. KENNEDY,12089,12171,01082009.txt,2940,477,111,2009,mr presid im proud join senat mikulski introduc legisl equal pay equal work fundament civil right past decad america made enorm progress toward ensur peopl equal chanc enjoy benefit great nation bipartisan civil ight bill enact expand strengthen law ensur fair pay worker despit advanc civil right still america unfinish busi therefor fit open th congress introduct lilli ledbett fair pay act bill restor basic right worker regardless race sex religion nation origin age disabl paid fairli free discrimin restor worker right challeng ongo discrimin hold unscrupul employ account legisl need suprem court turn back nation progress equal pay ledbett decis undermin core protect titl vii civil right act overturn decad preced establish fair workabl rule challeng pay discrimin claim need bill restor longstand rule discriminatori paycheck separ wrong may challeng worker within requir period check ledbett case juri found lilli ledbett paid less male cowork woman juri award back pay ms ledbett suprem court revers award hold wait long file lawsuit within short time goodyear first began discrimin never mind compani discrimin decad discrimin continu new paycheck receiv far often worker like lilli ledbett put fair day work go home less fair day pay women africanamerican latino worker earn fraction white male worker make mani qualifi older worker worker disabl also paid less cowork reason unrel perform job import ever attack problem pay discrimin correct injustic caus ledbett decis current econom crisi million american worker struggl make end meet pay discrimin make struggl harder worker cant afford lose econom ground protect worker must move quickli pass lilli ledbett fair pay act urg colleagu republican democrat alik send strong signal new congress dedic stand fair equal workplac lilli ledbett nation deserv less,283,FALSE

My question to those who support this bill is: Why are you afraid of a secret ballot? Cant we give workers credit -for making the right decision for themselves? In addition. a recent study has shown that increases in union workers under card check rules will likely lead to an increase in unemployment due to making their businesses less competitive.

1110019007,Madam President. I wish to speak on amendment No. 593. an amendment submitted by the Senator from Arizona. This amendment limits the flexibility of the executive branch. It has no impact on Government spending and will not add to congressional oversight. It is.an amendment which will serve no useful purpose to either the Congress or the executive branch. The amendment of the Senator from Arizona states that no funds for congressionally * directed spending programs could be spent unless the items were included in bill language. The Senator seems to believe that the inclusion of the items in bill language affords the Congress greater oversight over the items. This is not correct. The Senate has the ability to review. debate. and vote in relation to any item. whether it is included in this measure as bill language or just identified in report language. The Senator apparently believes that putting items in the bill language offers better control over spending. The opposite is true. When items are contained in bill language. the executive branch is afforded less opportunity to exercise management over use of the funds. For example. if the Congress appropriates $1 million for an item in bill language. the funding can be used only for that purpose. Under current law. funds must be spent for the purpose for which the funds were appropriated unless the Congress has provided agencies additional authority to transfer funds. While most agencies have some ability to transfer funds. the rules are more often restrictive. The only other recourse an agency has is to propose the funding for rescission. The effect of this amendment would be to require that every item specified in bill language could not be altered without either the use of authorized transfer authority or the passage of a new law governing the use of funds. If a product is allocated $1 million in report language but only costs $800.000 to complete. in most cases agencies are afforded some flexibility to reapply the remaining funds for other authorized purposes. However. once the items are included in bill language. unless additional legal authority has been enacted. they cannot be allocated for another purpose. If a Government program manager has an additional and unneeded $200.000 but which can only be used for that one purpose. what incentive does he or she have to make certain all the funds that are approved for spending are really necessary? The unintended consequence of this amendment is to limit the ability of agencies to adjust to changing circumstances. such as reduced costs or resolution of environmental issues. This amendment needlessly ties the hands of agencies. This amendment will not save funding. If it were to be enacted. the Congress would simply move items that currently appear in report language to bill language. We shouldnt see this amendment as a way to reduce spending. It would probably necessitate the adding of an additional 1.000 pages to the bill. but it would not save a dime. I am not sure what useful purpose this amendment is thought to have. Its enactment would limit the flexibility of our agencies to manage funds. The amendment provides no additional congressional oversight of funding. It would have no impact on spending. Its adoption would. however. force the Senate to send the bill back to the House. further delaying the passage of this important legislation. Therefore. I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment.

1110006143,Mr. President. I thank my colleague from Florida for raising this issue. This has come up recently as President Obama has changed the Mexico City policy so that the United States can fund abortions and groups that promote abortions overseas. This. of course. was not the policy of the United States in the last administration for the last 8 years. It was prior to that in the Clinton administration. And prior to that in the Reagan and Bush years. it was not the policy. This has been going back and forth for some time. I think it is pretty clear as far as the U.S. public that they do not like the idea of us funding abortions overseas. Some people may tolerate it here at home and say. OK. that is something I will just live with. but they do not like the idea of our taxpayers dollars going to fund abortions overseas. And at a time when we are staring at $10 trillion in debt going to $12 trillion. with a stimulus package of lots of different items. including some that do not seem particularly stimulative. this does not make any sense to people. Then you go overseas. and to a lot of places. it does not make any sense. either. as Senator MARTINEZ mentioned. that in Latin American countries. African countries that are very strongly prolife. in many cases. we are supporting policies or groups or institutions that are promoting abortion. What is going on with the United States? I thought you guys stood for life and for the dignity of the individual. and then the United States is funding this? This has been back and forth. a long seesaw battle. within our overall discussion here. I simply point out that this does not help us in foreign policy. This certainly does not help the budget deficit or the debt. This certainly does not stimulate the economy. There is no major policy reason to do this. Some people will argue that we should be supporting this policy and that this is something we ought to do to help people overseas. I think most people overseas would much rather have us put this money in AIDS prevention work. in malaria work. in working on neglected diseases that affect so many people overseas that have a broad basis of support in the United States and there. rather than this policy. which is such a. controversial. negative policy that is being promoted and pushed and seen that way in so many places around the world. This does not help us out at all. Then we look at some countries such as China where situations arise of forced abortions and forced sterilizations continuing to come out in the media. We have family planning support there. in places where forced abortions and forced sterilizations still take place. Our money is associated with some of these efforts in different places around the world. People do not like that policy. No matter how prochoice they are. they do not want us associated with that. and they do not see any reason for us to be involved in it. One can look at different things where one is on the choice or life spectrum. I am prolife. I am strongly prolife. I believe life has dignity from the very beginning to the very end and that it should be protected. Then we add this into the mix. using U.S. taxpayers dollars. dollars that we approve here. dollars from all the United States to promote something that a whole bunch of people in the United States completely disagree with on a whole variety of grounds. I ask my colleagues to back up for a second and say: Arent there better places for us to put this money if we are looking to do something that is lifeaffirming and helping people who are in difficulty? There are much better places we can certainly agree on. and I listed several of those on which we could agree and we could work together in this supposedly postpartisan period we are in. that we could work together on these issues. I pushed a number of them. and I can tell you for sure we have a need on neglected diseases in Third World countries and that a little bit of interest and focus on our part yields a whole bunch of saved lives. People dealing with malaria has been a big one. But we need to go on to diseases such as elephantiasis. sleeping sicknessthere is a series of them that would build up a lot of good will by the United States overseas. that would increase our standing in places around the world. that there would be no controversy whatsoever associated with but instead would be wholeheartedly embraced both here and overseas. For these reasons. I do not think it is wise for us to reengage with groups that promote abortion overseas. I ask my colleagues not to do that but to support the Martinez amendment and say to themselves: Lets not do this. Lets do this better. lets do this together. Lets support the Martinez amendment.
