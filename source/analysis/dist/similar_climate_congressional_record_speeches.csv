2000-04,0,Mr. SHUSTER,2000-04-12,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. I urge an aye vote on H.R. 2328. the Clean Lakes program. because it helps restore and protect our Nations 41 million acres of freshwater lakes. It helps States clean up their lakes. and it mitigates the harmful effects of high acidity like acid rain. Now. one may ask why is this particular bill. H.R. 2328. needed? It is because of the pollution or habitat degradation that impairs 39 percent of the 17 million acres which have already been surveyed. EPA currently requires States to stretch their limited nonpoint source funds to clean up their lakes. H.R. 2328 restores a national focus and priority on our lakes. I think it was very instructive. as the distinguished ranking member pointed out. the problem of such things as acid rain and how in Europe acid rain from the Ruhr Valley caused problems all the way up in Sweden. Certainly here in the United States. acid rain knows no State boundaries. Indeed. that is one of the reasons why. we need to have a national program. because certainly acid rain is something that crosses State lines. and the acid rain from one State can very seriously damage the lakes of another State. as has. in fact. been the case. Now. the background to this program. which was established under section 314 of the Clean Water Act. -provides for financial and technical assistance to States in restoring publicly owned lakes. In recognition of the unique water quality challenges. facing our Nations lakes. Congress included the Clean Lakes Program as part of the original 1972 Clean Water Act. Section 314 contains various State assessment and reporting requirements. a national demonstration program. and an EPA grant program for assistance to States in carrying out projects and program responsibilities. On June 23. 1999. the gentleman from New York introduced H.R. 2328. This was referred solely to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. H.R. 2328 would reauthorize funding for the Clean Lakes Program for fiscal years 2000 through 2005. and would increase the authorized annual funding levels from $30 million to $100 million. On -October 18. 1999. the Subcommittee on Water Resources and- Environment held a hearing on Clean Lakes and Water Quality Management and on H.R. 2328. On March 8. 2000. the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment marked up H.R. 2328. The subcommittee adopted an amendment in the nature of a substitute. This amendment. A.- reduced the funding authorization from $100 million annually to $50 million annually. and. B. added additional lakes to the list of lakes to receive priority con-,R,Mr. BORSKI,2000-04-12,Mr. Chairman. I want to thank the gentleman from Minnesota for yielding me this time and also to thank him for his leadership on this issue and so many issues that come before the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. I also want to commend our subcommittee chairman. the gentleman from New York . and our full committee chairman. my colleague. the gentleman from Pennsylvania . for working with us in a bipartisan manner which is. of course. the way this committee always works. and again I would add that is why we are so successful. I also want to commend the gentleman from New York . the author of this bill. for pushing and shoving and making sure this piece of legislation comes before us. Mr. Chairman. I want to rise in strong support of H.R. 2328. a bill to reauthorize the Environmental Protection Agencys Clean Lakes program. The Clean Lakes program was enacted in 1972 with the passage of the Clean Water Act. to provide additional funding to assess and control pollution levels in our Nations lakes. This program has served as a valuable resource for States to identify the sources of pollution. as well as to develop and implement programs aimed at reducing pollution levels in and restoring the quality of lake systems. The bill we are considering would reauthorize the Clean Lakes program. providing up to $50 million annually through 2005. In addition. in order to address the persistent problems of high acidity in our Nations lakes. this legislation would increase the authorization for programs aimed at reducing the levels of toxins present in these water bodies. Funding under this program could be used in developing new and innovative methods of neutralizing and restoring the natural buffering capacity of lakes. as well as other methods for removing toxic metals and other substances mobilized by high acidity. Finally. H.R. 2328 would add four additional lakes to the list of priority demonstration projects authorized under the Clean Lakes program. These lakes have been identified by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure as regionally significant and deserving of additional attention under this program. Mr. Chairman. I urge an aye vote on this legislation. I again want to thank the distinguished ranking member. the gentleman from Minnesota . for yielding me this time.,D,0.94928783
2000-04,1,Mrs. MORELLA,2000-04-12,Mr. Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time. Mr. Chairman. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his leadership in bringing this bill before us on the floor. and thank the gentleman from Minnesota . the ranking member. obviously. the gentleman from Virginia for initiating this. and the gentleman from Maryland . my colleague from Maryland. for his wonderful explication of some parts of it. The Chesapeake Bay. our Nations largest estuary. is an incredibly complex ecosytem. The Bay is one of our Nations most valuable natural resources. Its rich ecosytem with rivers. wetlands. trees. and the Bay itself supports and provides a national habitat for over 3.600 species of plants. fish. and animals. We know that over 15 million people now live in the Bay watershed. it includes parts of six States and the entire District of Columbia. These persons are. at all times. just a few steps from one of the more than 100.000 stream and river tributaries ultimately draining into the Bay. Every person. plant. and animal depend on each other to help the Chesapeake Bay system thrive and function properly. These complex relationships are countless. The Chesapeake Bay Program is a unique regional partnership of State and Federal Government agencies. and it has been encouraging and directing the restoration of the Bay since 1983. I am pleased that important progress has been made in renewing the Bay since the Chesapeake Bay Agreement was signed in 1983. Restoration efforts. led by the Chesapeake Bay Program. have had a profound effect on the health of the Bay. In addition. scientific research has led to a better understanding of the Bay. including how it works and what must be done to address problems. However. we still have a long way to go before we reach our goals for a restored Chesapeake Bay. Many questions about the future of the Bay remain unanswered. For example. blue crabs. perhaps the best known and most important resource of the Bay. have been below the longterm average level for several years. The oyster harvest has declined dramatically. Further efforts to reduce nutrient and sediment pollution are needed. I am pleased that this legislation today will help us address these concerns and allow us to move toward the goal of a -restored Chesapeake Bay. You know. Mr. Chairman. in only 10 days we -recognize and celebrate the 30th anniversary of Earth Day. Every year on this day. the people of our Nation and across the globe focus their attention on the environment. Both Earth Day and the legislation before us today offer us the opportunity to applaud our progress. but. more importantly. they allow us to renew our commitment to the challenges facing our planet and the Chesapeake Bay. We must preserve and protect this treasure. Mr. Chairman. I support the Chesapeake Bay Restoration Act and urge its swift. unanimous passage.,R,Mr. OBERSTAR,2000-04-12,"Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. I strongly support H.R. 3039. the Chesapeake Bay Restoration Act. The Chesapeake Bay is one of the great estuaries of the world. perhaps the greatest. the meeting place of salt and fresh water where new forms of life are created. Those forms of life. whether new forms or existing ones. are increasingly endangered in the worlds estuaries by the pollution that we discharge into the waters and into the meeting places. In 1983. the Federal Government and the States of Virginia. Maryland. Pennsylvania. as well as the District of Columbia. signed the first Chesapeake Bay Agreement. Four years later. the .Federal Government and the Bay States and the communities within them reached agreement on the problems facing the Bay. the shared responsibility for deteriorating conditions. and on the joint actions that were needed to slow and reverse the destruction of this resource. In the past 17 years. the hard work of all those involved is beginning to bear fruit. The Bay is showing signs of improvement. But the work is never over. This legislation will take a further step toward improvement of water quality and improvement of the overall health of the Bay ecosystem. The legislation will reauthorize the Environmental Protection Agencys successful Chesapeake Bay Program for an additional 6 years. giving stability and strength to this very important initiative. It will increase the program funding level. The Program Office of EPA has been very successful in working collaboratively with the States and the communities adjacent to the Bay in identifying causes of pollution. building partnerships to restore the health of that enormous resource. Under this legislation. EPA will continue the cooperative collaborative approach of developing interstate management plans. control harmful nutrients. control the addition of toxins to improve water quality. and restore habitats to the ecosystem. In addition. the legislation will incorporate into the Chesapeake Bay Agreement those improvements jointly recommended by the participating States. including recommendations for the administrator and authority for the administrator to approve small watershed grants to fund local governments and nonprofit organizations for local protection and restoration programs. If we do not address the health of the Bay by including the watersheds that drain into that Bay. we have not accomplished the purpose of preserving. restoring. and enhancing the quality of the waters of the Bay. That. I think. is the most important feature of this legislation. that it deals with the watershed and not just with the discharge points. I strongly support the legislation and urge an ""aye"" vote. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.",D,0.9752551
2009-02,0,Mr. SMITH of Texas,2009-02-11,"Mr. Speaker. I strongly support H.R. 554-""The National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act."" This legislation supports research and innovation in the field of nanotechnology and strengthens the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) by adding provisions to encourage nanotechnology education. studies. and economic development. Whether its medical research. military systems. or energy advancements. nanotechnology plays a vital role in our lives today and will help drive innovation for tomorrow. We see nanotechnology used in computers and other nanoelectronics. as well as a wide variety of products from landmine detectors to water filtration systems to sunscreens. The future of nanotechnology is limitless. Nanotechnology will pave the way for significant advances in many fields. including medical diagnostics. automotive performance. and solar energy. In short. nanotechnology is the convergence of 21st century science and technologies. It is proof that small technology can have a huge impact in the world. This legislation helps ensure that American companies have the resources they need to further develop nanotechnology. which will help American businesses remain on the cutting edge of technology and drive the American economy. I want to thank Chairman GORDON and Ranking Member HALL for their work in bringing this bipartisan legislation to the Floor today. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 554.",R,Mr. HONDA,2009-02-11,Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 554. the National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act. I commend Chairman BART GORDON and the other members of the Science and Technology Committee. on which I am proud to have once served. for the hard work and thoughtful consideration that went into this bill. I am pleased that this bill includes numerous provisions that I originally proposed in my own legislation. the Nanotechnology Advancement and New Opportunities (NANO) Act. H.R. 820. Nanotechnology has the potential to create entirely new industries and radically transform the basis of competition in other fields. and I am proud of my work with former Science Committee Chairman Sherwood Boehlert on the Nanotechnology Research and Development Act of 2003 to foster research in this area. But one of the things policymakers have heard from experts is that while the United States is a leader in nanotechnology research. our foreign -competitors are focusing -more resources and effort on the commercialization of those research results than we are. Both H.R. 554 and my own bill would focus Americas nanotechnology research and development programs on areas of national need such as energy . health care. and the environment. and have provisions to help assist in the commercialization of nanotechnology. In recent months. there has been much discussion about potential health and safety risks associated with nanotechnology. Uncertainty is one of the major obstacles to the commercialization of nanotechnologyuncertainty about what the risks might be and uncertainty about how the federal government might regulate nanotechnology in the future. Both my bill and H.R. 554 require the development of a nanotechnology research plan that will ensure the development and responsible stewardship of nanotechnology. Other important areas that are addressed by both H.R. 554 and H.R. 820 include: the development of curriculum tools to help improve nanotechnology education. the establishment of educational partnerships to help prepare students to pursue postsecondary education in nanotechnology. support for the development of environmentally beneficial nanotechnology. and the development of advanced tools for simulation and characterization to enable rapid prediction. characterization and monitoring for nanoscale manufacturing. I am also pleased that H.R. 554 will require that the NNI Advisory Panel must be a standalone advisory committee. This is a concept I originally proposed in 2002 in the Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Advisory Board Act (H.R. 5669 in the 107th Congress). I would like to thank the members of the Blue Ribbon Task Force on Nanotechnology (BRTFN). a panel of California nanotechnology experts with backgrounds in established industry. startup companies. consulting groups. nonprofits. academia. government. medical research. and venture capital that I convened with thenCalifornia State Controller Steve Westly during 2005. for the important recommendations included in .its report. Thinking Big About Thinking Small. many of which are reflected in the bill we are considering today. I would also like to thank Scott Hubbard. who was the Director of the NASA Ames Research Center at that time and who served as working chair of the BRTFN. and all of the staff at Ames whose hard work made the task force run so well and helped produced a great report. The report is available on my Web site at http://honda.house.govissues/links/ brtfnreportfinal.pdf. Again. I congratulate the Science and Technology Committee and Chairman GORDON for their work on this bill and thank them for incorporating so many of the provisions from my bill into H.R. 554. and I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation to reauthorize the nations nanotechnology research and development program.,D,0.9901296
2009-02,1,Ms. COLLINS,2009-02-09,(for herself and Mr. NELSON of Nebraska)) to the bill H.R. 1. making supplemental appropriations for job preservation and creation. infrastructure investment. energy efficiency and science. assistance to the unemployed. and State and local fiscal stabilization. for fiscal year ending September 30. 2009. and for other purposes. which was ordered to lie on the table.,R,Mr. OBEY,2009-02-13,Madam Speaker. pursuant to House Resolution 168. I call up the conference report on the bill making supplemental appropriations for job preservation and creation. infrastructure investment. energy efficiency and science. assistance to the unemployed. and State and local fiscal stabilization. for fiscal year. ending September 30. 2009. and for other purposes. and ask for its immediate consideration.,D,0.9925005
2015-06,0,Mr. WHITFIELD,2015-06-24,Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. I would like to say that. obviously. you cant have a discussion about this regulation without climate change. and frequently. we hear that climate change is responsible for every extreme weather condition. I would point out that The Economist magazine. in its May 5 issue. stated that it is impossible to say categorically that climate change has caused any individual storm. flood. drought. heat wave. tornado. or hurricane. Scientists agree that it is impossible to say that. Mr. Chairman. I would like to make one other comment. The President of the United States believes that climate change is the number one issue facing mankind. All of us recognize that the climate has been changing since the beginning of time. but where we fundamentally disagree with the President is we think there are other. more pressing issues dealing with poverty. creating jobs. economic growth. access to clean water. access to health care. and fighting diseases like pancreatic cancer. We think those are more urgent. But this President has got 61 individual government programs and is spending $23 billion a year on climate change in addition to trying to push regulations like this without any involvement of Congress. Mr. Chairman. I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from North Dakota . a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.,R,Mrs. CAPPS,2015-06-24,I thank my colleague for yielding. Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 2042. The socalled Ratepayer Protection Act does nothing to protect any of us. In fact. it does just the opposite. This bill would simply continue this majoritys policy of sticking their head in the sand and doing nothing to address the serious problems of climate change. The Pope has said that climate change is a reality. It is impacting our lives every day. It is impacting our economy. and it is only going to get worse. Mr. Chairman. we are confronted almost daily with new evidence that climate change is leading to increased health risks. threatening our environment. and costing our economy billions of dollars. Studies have shown that climate change can lead and does lead to higher rates of asthma. reduces crop yields. acidifies our oceans. and increases the risk for harmful algal blooms. More severe droughts are threatening drinking and agriculture water supplies in many locations. while warmer climates are increasing the severity and frequency of storms in others. A recent study also showed that climate change could undo many of the improvements that we have seen in human wellbeing and life expectancy over the last half century. The power sector is the largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. accounting for nearly onethird of the U.S. total. Mr. Chairman. while we will continue to depend on fossil fuels for some time. we can and we must do more to limit their impacts on our climate. The clean power plan does just that by setting carbon reduction goals for each State and allowing States to implement customized plans to meet those goals. The clean power plan will help maintain an affordable. reliable energy system while cutting pollution and protecting public health and the environment now and for future generations. yet H.R. 2042 would derail the clean power plan and all the health and economic benefits that will come with it. The bill is full of excuses to support inaction. but does nothing to solve the problem. Mr. Chairman. this inaction on climate change is putting our constituents and our future generations at risk. It is long past time to acknowledge the causes of climate change and to tackle the issue head on. It is time for us to work together to address this problem. not to pass legislation that continues to ignore it. For these reasons and so many others. I strongly oppose H.R. 2042. and I urge my colleagues to vote against it as well.,D,0.9641867
2015-06,1,Mr. MEEHAN,2015-06-12,Mr. Speaker. I thank the chairman. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the Trade Act of 2015. Ninetyfive percent of the worlds market is outside the United States. and selling our goods to these markets is critical to Americas future prosperity. One in five of American jobs are directly tied to trade. If we cant knock down the tariffs that are placed on American goods around the world. the world is going to buy these goods elsewhere. Simply put. a strong trade agenda is essential to Americas national security and the economic opportunity of hardworking taxpayers. If you want a strong trade agreement with better protections for U.S. workers. you want trade promotion authority. TPA allows Congress to hold the administration accountable and gives Congress the chance to vote down a bad deal. Without it. we are negotiating from a disadvantage. If we are not setting the rules on global trade. China will. Mr. Speaker. trade promotion authority means stronger. better trade agreements. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it because what is happening right now is. if we dont have an increasingly aggressive China in there setting the rules. the trade agreements give us the chances on things like labor. things like the environment. things like a fair and open Internet. Those are the kinds of things that are going to create future jobs and keep the world safer and better. I urge my colleagues to support this.,R,Ms. BONAMICI,2015-06-18,"Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 2146. the Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015. For the past several years I have had many conversations about trade with the people of Northwest Oregon. Ive spoken with farmers. environmentalists. semiconductor manufacturers. wine makers. workers. sports and outdoor apparel employees. and others. The district I represent has many tradedependent jobs and industries. We export a broad array of productsfrom computer chips to potato chips. Last year in Oregon. nearly 6.000 Oregon companies exported more than $20 billion in products. Expanding the overseas markets for U.S. goods will help businesses expand in this country. Trade agreements done right make it easier to sell Americanmade goods and they level the playing field by reducing tariffs that currently make it difficult for Oregonians to compete in many of the worlds markets. This legislation is not the trade agreement itself. but rather a bill through which Congress establishes requirements for the negotiation of trade agreements and the procedure for Congress to use when voting on whether to approve the agreement when it is final. The Trade Priorities and Accountability Act earned my vote because it requires the President to negotiate a trade agreement that includes strong and enforceable labor and environmental standards. fosters innovation. would help expand exports. provides transparency for the American people. and guarantees a meaningful role for Congress in trade negotiations. I strongly support the rights of workers and their ability to collectively bargain and work in a safe environment. I also oppose child labor and forced labor. The Trade Priorities and Accountability Act raises the bar in these areas and includes provisions that require trading partners to comply with internationallyaccepted labor standards and face trade sanctions if they do not. For the first time it includes human rightsone of the cornerstones of our democratic valuesas a negotiating objective. Oregons First Congressional District is known for its natural treasuresfrom the Pacific Ocean to the Columbia River to the Clatsop State Forestand it is imperative that they be preserved for future generations. Deciding between conserving our natural resources and growing our economy is a false choice. we can and must do both. The Trade Priorities and Accountability Act ensures that our clean air. land. and water will not be up for negotiation. The bill also protects intellectual property to safeguard innovation and fight piracy overseas. but with provisions to ensure that those protections will not impede access to muchneeded medicines for people in developing countries. The Trade Priorities and Accountability Act requires trade agreements to contain high standards and protections. and it also requires that the agreements include strong enforcement provisions to make clear that the standards and protections will be upheld and enforced. It is important to my constituents that any trade agreement be accessible and transparent to the public. The Trade Priorities and Accountability Act includes unprecedented access to trade agreements. the entire final agreement must be made available to the public for a minimum of 60 days before the President signs it. In addition. after the full text of the trade agreement becomes public. there will still be months before Congress votes on whether to approve it. To earn my vote. any trade agreement must be good for Americans. The jobs we gain by expanding exports tend to pay high wages. but there is a risk that some workers may be displaced by trade and by globalization. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) is an important program to help workers transition into new fields by investing in skills and worker retaining. Without a reauthorization. TAA will expire at the end of September 2015. I voted in favor of TAA last week. but unfortunately it did not pass. But let me be very clear. I voted for the TPA again today because the Speaker. the Senate Majority Leader. and the President have committed that Trade Adjustment Assistance and customs enforcement legislation will also move forward without delay. I was deeply concerned that an early version of TAA legislation included cuts to Medicare. Seniors serve our country. contribute to our economy. raise families. and strengthen communities across the nation. I urged House leadership to eliminate this provision. The bill I voted for did not cut Medicare and I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure seniors are not singled out to pay for this program. This trade package. however. is far from perfect. and as we move forward I will continue to work to pass TAA and improve the trade agreement. I am very disappointed that partisan language to tie the administrations hands on climate change was inserted at the last minute into the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act. which passed the House of Representatives last week without my support. I am also very concerned that two very smart enforcement provisions offered by my colleague from Oregon. Representative EARL BLUMENAUER. were deleted. His ""Green 301"" and enforcement fund provisions were very important to the overall effectiveness of the customs bill. and I will encourage the conferees to insist upon their inclusion in the bill we ultimately send to the Presidents desk for signature. We live in a changing and global economy. Markets. industries. and technologies evolve and American businesses and workers need to be able to react and adapt to thrive. A 21st century trade agreement broadens our countrys reach and. done right. leads to more opportunity. more growth. and more job creation. It also supports the principle of trade according to fair rules. equally applied. as opposed to all parties doing whatever they want on a playing field that is far from level. I am committed to policies that support a strong. longterm economy for hardworking Oregonians and Americans. A trade agreement done right can help achieve this goal. and passing H.R. 2146 is an important step in this process.",D,0.9771736
