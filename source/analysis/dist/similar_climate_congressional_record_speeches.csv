2001-12,0,Mr. BEREUTER,2001-12-05,Mr. Speaker. this Member commends to his colleagues the following opinion piece written by Mr. Bryce Neidig. president of the Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation. which appeared. in the November 27. 2001. York NewsTimes. Mr. Neidig makes a convincing case for passing legislation which would implement a national energy policy. As Mr. Neidig stresses. farmers are heavily reliant on petroleum products and could suffer great hardship if Congress fails to develop a meaningful energy policy On August 2. 2001. the House approved an energy bill which would diversify our energy sources and create greater energy reliability and independence for the United States. Now is the time to enact a longterm energy policy. Congress must help assure farmers and all Americans of the increased development of diverse. reliable. and affordable energy sources.,R,Mr. DASCHLE,2001-12-05,"Mr. President. after months of hard work by the chairman of nine committees. we are today introducing legislation to establish a national energy policy. The bill we are introducing provides a blueprint for solving many of the nations energy problems. and will provide the American people with clean. reliable. and affordable energy for generations to come. This bill recognizes that the use of energy has profound consequences for economic health. environmental quality and national security. The energy policy we choose to adopt will have longlasting consequences in each of these areas. Today. we have an opportunity to dramatically reshape Americas energy future. and it is an opportunity we cannot afford to lose. The strength of our economy depends. in large measure. in the abundant and inexpensive supply of energy. The periodic price shocks experienced by American drivers since the mid1970s underscores the vulnerability associated with our growing dependence on foreign oil. At the same time. the rolling blackouts experienced by California last summer serves as a cautionary tale of the failure to guarantee reliable and abundant supplies of electricity. One of the greatest environmental challenges that our nationand the worldwill face in the coming years is the rising tide of global climate change. The way we generate and use energy in the future will determine whether we effectively face this challenge and prevent the catastrophic impacts of global warming. and whether we can make the air we breathe cleaner and more healthy. And finally. the success of our foreign policy and the security of our nation are inextricably linked to our future patterns of energy use. In the last 12 years we have spent billions of dollars fighting two wars in the Middle East. both of which involved oil. When Iraq invaded Kuwait it endangered the oil fields that supplied a significant percentage of the worlds energy. The U.S.. in cooperation with much of the rest of the world. was forced to respond to that threat. More recently. we have learned that much of Osama bin Ladens financial support came from supporters made rich by the oilbased economy of the MiddleEast. It is long past time when we take whatever steps we can toward freeing ourselves from our dependence on foreign oil. and the volatility associated with it. The bill we are introducing today is intended to address these challenges by pursuing a thoughtful. progressive. and realistic energy policies. I thank Chairman BINGAMAN for the job he has done in working with nine committees to produce this bill. In gddition to his Energy and Natural Resources Committee. he also coordinated with: the Environment and Public Works Committee. the Commerce Committee. the Banking Committee. the Indian Affairs Committee. the Foreign Relations Committee. the Governmental Affairs Committee. the Agriculture Committee. and the Finance Committee.

2004-12,0,Mr. BURNS,2004-12-08,Mr. President. I appreciate the good works of my good friend from Florida. I see both Florida Senators are in the Chamber. Of course. Senator GRAHAM is just about to close out his career in this Senate. and he will be missed. He was one of my neighbors when I first came here some 16 years ago. when they were living just not too far down the street. So I appreciate him and all the talents and the contributions he has made to this body and tothe country. I hope he is successful in the Black Angus business in Florida. He will be going back to his beloved ranch and probably do a little writing. get a little philosophical. I know he has done that at times. He can do it in an environment that is befitting a retired Senator. We appreciate him. We do not say goodbye in our part of the country. We just say so long. Our trails will cross one of these days.,R,Mr. INOUYE,2004-12-08,"Mr. President. I rise to join my colleagues in tribute to Senator ERNEST ""FRITZ"" HOLLINGS. I will miss my good friend from South Carolina. who in 2003. at the age of 81. finally became his States senior senatorafter 36 years as a junior Senator. In addition to being remembered as a coauthor of the GrammRudmanHollings legislation that cut tens of billions of dollars from the Federal budget deficit. FRITZ HOLLINGS has left an indelible mark on our nation in the areas of health care. environmental protection. resource conservation. technology development. job creation. transportation security. and law enforcement. to name a few. Immediately after the September 11. 2001. terrorist attacks on America. Senator HOLLINGS worked to protect the safety of our traveling public by authoring the Aviation Security Act which created the Transportation Security Administration. Similarly. recognizing that Americas ports and borders were our Nations weak security links. Senator HOLLINGS championed legislation to increase security at Americas ports. As the father of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Senator HOLLINGS recognized the extent to which the ocean environment sustains usfrom human uses in commerce and recreation to being the original cradle of life on bur planet. He knew the importance of taking appropriate steps to be responsible stewards of this rich. yet fragile resource. His oceans legacy includes authorship of the National Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972. which established Federal policy for protecting coastal -areas. and the Marine Mammal Protection Act. which also became the model for other countries. for the protection of dolphins. sea otters and other mammals. In a continuing effort to do what is best for our ocean environment. Senator HOLLINGS created the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy in 2000. to review the accomplishments of the last 30 years. and recommend actions for the future. Upon the issuance of the report. Senator HOLLINGS laid the groundwork for legislation to adopt the recommendations of the Ocean Commission. I am the proud cosponsor of two of those measures. S. 2647. the. Fritz Hollings National Ocean Policy and Leadership Act. and S. 2648. the Ocean Research Coordination and Advancement Act. Beyond the oceans. Senator HOLLINGS worked to make our communities and schools safer. through programs such as Community Oriented Policing Services. COPS. that put more than 100.000 police officers on the streets in 13.000 communities across the country. The COPS program is also the largest source of dedicated funding for interoperable communications for public safety officers. Senator HOLLINGS brought competition to the telecommunications arena which resulted in new services to consumers at affordable rates. I will miss Senator HOLLINGS wisdom. vision. and wit. but mostly his friendship. I wish FRITZ and his wife Peatsy a fond aloha.",D,0.797534
2012-06,0,Mrs. LUMMIS,2012-06-06,Mr. Chairman. the Bishop amendment strikes environmental mitigation funding that has no place in this bill. This is a Homeland Security bill. We spend this money to protect the homeland and secure our borders. These are some of the most important responsibilities we have as a Congress under our Constitution. But this money wont go to border security. This money will go to pay off Federal agencies just so the Border Patrol can access public lands. Our Border Patrol is locked out of huge swaths of public lands along our border unless they fork over tax dollars for environmental mitigation. So we. the Congress. under the auspices of border security. are spending the peoples hardearned money on a slush fund for land managers. Just to name a few examples. agencies have demanded this money to monitor bats. to monitor pronghorn antelopemy State of Wyoming has three times more antelope than peopleand in one case. to protect the endangered ocelot. which hasnt even been seen in the area for 20 years. This is madness. If you want to protect the species and ecosystems along the border. then secure the border. Rampant border crossings across wilderness do more damage than our Border Patrol ever could. We need to eliminate restrictions on the Border Patrols access to Federal land. not enable them. If you want to stop this extortion of border security dollars. vote for the Bishop amendment. This puts money toward air and marine interdiction. And if you want environmental mitigation. put it in the Interior bill where it belongs. and where Congress can keep track of where the money goes. and where land managers have to justify it. Let our Border Patrol do its job. Vote for the Bishop amendment. Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Utah .,R,Mr. GRIJALVA,2012-06-19,I think the purpose of title XIV of H.R. 2578 is not to make the border more secure. Rather. the purpose of the bill is to use border security as cover to effectively repeal more than a century of environmental protections for Americans living and working along our borders with Canada and Mexico. In April. the Natural Resources Committee held a joint oversight hearing with the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. during which the Government Accountability Office. the Interior Department. the Agriculture Department. and the Border Patrol all testified under oath that Federal land management laws do not impair border security. According to the GAO report. 22 of 26 Border Patrol agentsin- charge that were interviewed reported that Federal land management laws had no impact on the overall security status of their jurisdiction. In summary. the number of Border Patrol agentsincharge who found that Federal land management laws were impeding border security but were prevented from fixing the problems by the Interior Department was exactly zero. The administration concurred with this finding at multiple hearings. The record is clear. And the problem this bill claims to solve does not exist. The true purpose of this legislation is also clear. The proponents oppose the morethan30 bedrock environmental protections that will be effectively repealed by this legislation. including the Clean Water Act. the Clean Air Act. the Clean Drinking Water Act. everywhere. not just within 100 miles of the border. Title XIV employs a manufactured conflict with border security to weaken their application. The laws to be waived by this act are the work product of dozens of administrations and Congresses. developed after thousands of hours of negotiation and compromise and. in most cases. were enacted with strong bipartisan support. Title XIV hands the Border Patrol a unilateral veto over all of these laws. all this work. and all this bipartisan effort. Enactment of this legislation and title XIV would not only allow DHS to trample the ground near the border. It would also allow the Agency to trample the rights of States and Native people. This legislation would empower individual patrol agents to enter tribal land without notice and conduct any and all activities. including excavation and construction. without regard for the presence of tribal sites or tribal leadership. The real problem of border enforcement is one of manpower. budgets. economic incentives. and difficult terrain. This bill addresses none of those concerns. We will not secure our borders by allowing our waters to be polluted. We will not secure our borders by allowing our air to be dirtier. by ignoring the laws that have protected the environment and the American people. That will not bring security to the border. This legislation and title XIV reduce the number of immigrants coming to this country. If it does. it will only be because the water. air. and economics of our border communities are so degraded that no one wants to come there anymore. This legislation is sweeping. Its reactionary. This bill is not what it appears to be. And it should be rejected. I reserve the balance of my time.,D,0.98648393
